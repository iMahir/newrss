<p class="has-text-align-none">After Colorado became the first state to <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/01/worlds-first-legal-recreational-marijuana-sales-begin-in-colorado/">legalize</a> the sale of recreational cannabis to any adult in 2014, it took just 10 years for about <a href="https://disa.com/marijuana-legality-by-state">half</a> of the country to follow suit. More than 100 million adults in the US went from having no legal access to the drug to being able to waltz into their local dispensary, buy some weed, and take it home to get as stoned as they please. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/people/k/kilmer_beau.html">Beau Kilmer</a>, co-director of the RAND <a href="https://www.rand.org/well-being/justice-policy/centers/dprc.html">Drug Policy Research Center</a>, sees the same kind of early activity in state psychedelic policy, including budding <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/23-0004%20%28Psilocybin%202024%29.pdf">legislation</a> to legalize sales, that he saw in cannabis right before the wave of legalizing commercial sales took off. While the medicinal use of psychedelics gains more attention and as <a href="https://reason.org/commentary/state-psychedelics-legalization-and-policy-roundup-march-2024/">states allocate funds</a> toward research, the prospect of retail psychedelics has quietly landed on our doorstep. “State policymakers, whether they like it or not, are going to start confronting these conversations,” said Kilmer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, public conversation about how a retail psychedelic market might actually work has been all but nonexistent. So far, most debate over how to expand legal access to psychedelics has focused on segmented approaches like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult">therapy</a>, religious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/us/psychedelic-drugs-church-religion.html">exemptions</a>, or supervised <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/health/psychedelic-drugs-mushrooms-oregon.html">retreat centers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even in a world with all these models firmly in place, plus more general drug <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/ungass2016/Contributions/Civil/DrugPolicyAlliance/DPA_Fact_Sheet_Approaches_to_Decriminalization_Feb2015_1.pdf">decriminalization</a> across the board, there would still be plenty of people who would not be able to access psychedelics. Not everyone will or can get a prescription for their psychedelic of choice. Most people won’t be able to afford supervised programs, which run for a minimum of about <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.omniagroupashland.com/services/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1720806618065068&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vro1ey5aTfX4ZW6YD4cLK">$1,800</a> for a single, low-dose session in Oregon’s state program, or thousands more in <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/article/the-rise-of-psychedelic-retreats">luxury retreats</a> abroad. Neither will everyone want to join a literal church in order to get religious exemption. And for anyone who doesn’t happen to have a friend who knows a guy who grows mushrooms and wants to share, decriminalizing psychedelics won’t do much to expand access on its own, either.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If ending psychedelic prohibition means all adults should have reasonable access, retail sales —&nbsp;being able to simply buy the drugs from a store —&nbsp;could help fill the gaps. But it’s easy to understand why even ardent psychedelic advocates might balk at the idea. Psychedelics do <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0293349">come with risks</a>, and more access means more exposure to those risks, which is an area where <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23954347/psychedelics-bad-trips-ketamine-mdma-psilocybin-lsd-risks">psychedelic research is lacking</a>. Plus, there’s a real concern among advocates that if psychedelic legalization moves too quickly, or too imprudently, one wrong step can plunge the whole project back into prohibition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because it’s so easy to imagine how commercializing psychedelics could go awry, blithely selling powerful experiences that can run what seems like an infinite spectrum from <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism">revelation</a> to <a href="https://bulletin.hds.harvard.edu/a-theological-reckoning-with-bad-trips/">terror</a> is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/opinion/sunday/drug-legalization-mdma-psilocybin.html">often dismissed</a>. But our options are not limited to either the worst forms of commercialization — what some see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/magazine/marijuana-legalization-new-york.html">already playing out</a> with cannabis — or continuing in the restrictive legacy of prohibition. There is a very wide terrain of possibilities for how to design a retail market for psychedelics that can both broaden access while retaining some regulation and safety measures. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This uncharted terrain was the subject of a <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2825-1.html">recent report published by RAND</a> —&nbsp;a think tank whose research has had <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/06/when-rand-made-magic-in-santa-monica">major influence</a> on government policy since its inception as a branch of the US Air Force in 1948. Of all places, I did not expect a think tank that still works closely with the government to be advancing the conversation around how to sell psychedelics to people outside of therapy clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">RAND’s report joins Transform Drug Policy Foundation’s “<a href="https://transformdrugs.org/publications/how-to-regulate-psychedelics">How to Regulate Psychedelics</a>,” published late last year, as some of the first major pieces of policy research to begin mapping the possible policy options for designing a retail psychedelics market.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The federal government currently has multiple options when it comes to the supply of psychedelics, but it does not have unlimited time,” the report states. Legislation for retail psychedelics is already getting off the ground in some states, like the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/23-0004%20%28Psilocybin%202024%29.pdf">California Psilocybin Initiative</a>. “Now is the time for US federal policymakers to decide whether they want psilocybin and other psychedelic substances to follow in the footsteps of the for-profit cannabis model.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Psychedelic therapy isn’t enough to put an end to the restrictive legacy of prohibition. And while it’s easy enough to say that psychedelics should never have been fully outlawed, as they were in 1970, thinking through how to make them legal and accessible for everyone is to confront a thicket of questions that we’ve only just begun to grapple with.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The varieties of retail psychedelics</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So if we’re going to consider the retail sale of psychedelics, how can we go about it without, you know, plunging society into a psychedelic nightmare fueled by abundant corner-store mushrooms, Juul-branded DMT vape pens in young people’s innocent hands, and flooded emergency rooms with no idea how to help people whose perceptions of the world have melted into an all-consuming, pulsating void?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kilmer explained that the logistics of retail psychedelics fall into one of two categories: supply architectures and design considerations. Supply architectures come first. Who gets to sell psychedelics? The RAND report lays out a taxonomy of options, including sales by a government authority, sales by nonprofits, sales by for-benefit corporations, and full-on for-profit sales.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this view, the most modest step in retail would be letting the government have a monopoly on distribution. That’s how many US states <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2020-01-16/end-of-prohibition-gave-states-a-new-job-regulating-liquor">handled</a> the end of alcohol prohibition in the 1930s (and some states still do). It’s also how a number of Canadian <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/canadian-cannabis-stores-by-provinces-territories/">provinces</a>, like Quebec and Nova Scotia, do cannabis sales today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A government monopoly on psychedelic sales has a few benefits. A single government supplier would make monitoring product safety easier (as in, no MDMA <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8282667/">laced with fentanyl</a>, which is increasingly a problem on the black market, or sketchy mushroom chocolates that <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024">actually make you sick</a>). The absence of retail competition would mean the incentives for irresponsible marketing that pushes psychedelics onto new consumers — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-marijuana-business-4245bb958368e1863d7ac9b639886790">a problem</a> with the cannabis market — would be turned way down. I do not imagine the government would erect billboards advertising their LSD products. (In the 1950s, for instance, they kept pretty quiet about their LSD experiments for <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/95mkultra.pdf">mind control and military uses</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, giving the government the sole power to legally sell psychedelics after President Nixon’s government drove them underground in the first place would be an irony to behold. And RAND’s report noted that even in the cannabis legalization realm, the idea of sticking to state-run stores didn’t gain much traction in the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One step further would be legalizing sales through only certain types of organizations, like non-profits or for-benefit corporations. For example, when New York handed out its <a href="https://www.nysscpa.org/news/publications/the-trusted-professional/article/nonprofits-awarded-cannabis-dispensary-licenses-include-three-based-in-nyc-112222">first wave of retail licenses</a> for cannabis, they went to either non-profits or equity applicants (mostly people with past cannabis-related convictions). By concentrating retail licenses with organizations that have goals other than profit, some of the potential excesses of commercializing psychedelics, from excessive marketing to skirting regulations in search of more revenue, could potentially be counterbalanced by emphases on public health or equity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Applying a bit more restriction, some countries, like Uruguay, Spain, and now <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/germanys-parliament-votes-to-legalize-limited-marijuana-possession-and-allow-cannabis-clubs">Germany</a>, have allowed a non-profit collective model for cannabis that could be adapted for psychedelics, through what are known as “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149291823001297">social clubs</a>.” These provide on-site locations where members can purchase and use drugs with varying degrees of community and peer support built in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And finally, the approach that now dominates cannabis in the US: for-profit sales. In theory, a for-profit approach could benefit consumers by enlisting competition to push prices down. But it also creates an incentive for companies to push against regulations in search of a financial edge, while both advertising and innovating to seek out as many new customers as possible. THC gummies are one thing, but LSD-infused ring pops? Psilocybin bubble tea? This leads down a slippery slope that makes even advocates uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although cannabis parallels are abundant, there are major differences when thinking about following the same model for psychedelics. Kilmer explained that retail cannabis was driven by two major motivations: to reduce arrests and generate state tax revenue. But he thinks that neither will really factor into psychedelic policy reform. Both the number of arrests and the amount of revenue associated with psychedelics (according to RAND’s survey of psilocybin users) are far less than with cannabis. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And he expects the actual market dynamics to have at least three major differences, too. First, he thinks psychedelic consumers will be far less sensitive to changes in price than cannabis. Cannabis users can always turn to its robust black market if they balk at the price of a blunt, but someone hunting for LSD will likely have a harder time. Second, the question of supervised use is basically non-existent with cannabis, which is essentially consumed much like alcohol, but is a big part of psychedelic use, where even recreational consumers may want to keep someone around to watch over them. And third, while many people use cannabis frequently, RAND’s survey data found that infrequent users drive the psychedelic market as it exists today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among any of the supply architectures, success or failure will come down to the massive list of design considerations. Who gets to manufacture (or grow) the drugs, and how can we ensure quality control? How should we regulate the packaging of retail psychedelic products? How can we effectively communicate informed consent? What strategies for public education can help create models of responsible use? What kinds of advertising are acceptable? Should doses be restricted at all? What kind of harm reduction information should come with purchases?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I could go on for a very long time with these sorts of questions, which will need more than two lengthy think tank reports to navigate. The reports from Transform and RAND have at least started the important work of taking them seriously, rather than turning away at the first depiction of psychedelic capitalism gone awry. But we’ll need much more data and analysis to make sense of what prudent steps forward might actually look like. “Once I really started digging in and crunching the numbers, I realized that a lot of the data we need just doesn’t exist,” said Kilmer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And with retail legislation already in the works, we’ll need it fast.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">New York proposes a potentially reasonable way forward: psychedelic permits</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates for psychedelics access have been hearing that “we need to wait for more data” for quite some time. And in many cases where psychedelics could help, like for people <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/15/24156372/psychedelics-chronic-pain-cluster-headache-medicine-lsd-psilocybin">suffering from debilitating chronic pain</a> or PTSD, every day spent waiting is another day in pain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which is part of what makes <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/A10375#:~:text=Allows%20the%20growth%2C%20cultivation%2C%20and%20regulated%20adult%20use%20of%20psilocybin,and%20the%20licensure%20of%20cultivators.">the bill</a> introduced in May by New York State Representative Amy Paulin, who chairs the Assembly Health Committee, so interesting. It offers a way forward that doesn’t require waiting for policymakers to figure out how to whip up and regulate an entire retail market before offering access. The other part is that among the options for actually stepping into retail psychedelics, it strikes me as by far the most reasonable approach to balancing expanding access while keeping an emphasis on safety.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bill would essentially take our approach to driving licenses, and adapt it for psychedelics. People 18 and up would have to go through a health screening, take an educational course, and pass a test, after which they’d receive a permit to buy psychedelics (in this bill’s case, only psilocybin) from licensed vendors. They could then take the drugs home and use as they please. They could also then grow the mushrooms at home, and share them with other permitted adults.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whereas approaches outlined in Transform and RAND’s reports focus on licensing the <em>supply</em> of psychedelics, the permit model adds another layer of protection by focusing on who’s licensed to purchase and consume them. There will be, no doubt, people upset by the idea of requiring a government permit to purchase or consume psychedelics. But the same is required of other activities that pose a reasonable threat to oneself and others, like driving. If the alternative is no retail access whatsoever, let them holler.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bill tries to fill in some of the missing logistics around how to actually pull this off, specifying that licensed mushroom cultivators could sell psilocybin directly to permit holders via a system managed by the Department of Health, which would also oversee the content of the permit course. Of course, questions abound. What will the health screenings screen for? Should permitting include a guided trip as an experiential component? How will permit holders be connected with support services, should something go wrong? What goes into becoming a licensed cultivator? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, an approach that requires licensing at each step of the commercial journey, from production to distribution to consumption, builds in plenty of opportunities for regulation, while still filling the gaps in supply left by therapy, supervised programs, or religious exemptions. And by requiring permits for consumers, it leans deeper into harm reduction than the for-profit cannabis model that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/magazine/marijuana-legalization-new-york.html">coming under increasing criticism</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no approach to retail psychedelics that’s without risk. But cars killed <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813561">nearly 41,000</a> Americans last year alone, and we keep licensing people to use those. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Obviously, there are a number of concerns, especially if you were to unleash a commercial industry,” said Kilmer. “But at the end of the day, you can have the best empirical evidence out there with minimal uncertainty, and a lot of it still just comes down to the values and risk preferences for the people making decisions.”</p>

<p>I woke up the day after Valentine’s Day bleary-eyed, fuzzy-headed, and with a slight pit in my stomach.</p>

<p>I hadn’t overdrank. I hadn’t been ghosted, scorned, or broken up with either. In fact, I’m happily married to a man who rolls his eyes at the Hallmark holiday but knows how to woo me: namely, via wings and beer, which we’d savored the night before, along with a variety show of sorts at our friend’s Brooklyn loft. On the surface, the night had been just right. But my gut told a different story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It reminded me that, the day prior, I’d been reporting a mental health story that had seeped deep into my psyche. I’d felt misunderstood by a relative when I’d tried to open up about it. I’d cried during the show’s opening musical act because, well, I’m a sap. </p>

<p>So come February 15, I — surely along with plenty of others for a variety of reasons — awoke to an emotional hangover, or that groggy, queasy feeling that lingers after a heavy conversation, therapy session, or even dark movie. While not an official medical term, the “condition” is quite common, and makes sense from a physiological and psychological perspective, experts told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Our reactions [to the outside world] are driven by our internal world, and our internal world is influenced by what happened yesterday,” <a href="https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/lila-davachi">Lila Davachi, PhD</a>, a psychology professor at Columbia University who’s studied how emotions affect memories, said. “We’re not just blank slates every morning.”  </p>

<p>I felt better already. Here’s what else I learned about why we might experience emotional hangovers, who’s most vulnerable, and whether there’s anything we can do to prevent — or pacify — them. Spoiler alert: Water and rest are tried-and-true hangover cures, even if you’re sober. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Defining the emotional hangover&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Different people have different definitions of emotional hangovers. Perhaps most prominently, <a href="https://drjudithorloff.com/9-strategies-to-cure-emotional-hangovers/">Judith Orloff, MD,</a> a psychiatrist and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empaths-Survival-Guide-Strategies-Sensitive/dp/1622036573"><em>The Empath’s Survival Guide</em></a>, describes it as “an energetic residue” left over from an interaction with an “energy vampire,” or someone who, intentionally or not, saps your mental and emotional energy. </p>

<p>“Toxic emotions can linger long afterward, which make you feel exhausted, beset with brain fog, or ill,” she writes.</p>

<p>In my case, it wasn’t any particular person from whom I needed to recover, but rather a set of mildly emotionally fatiguing circumstances that didn’t subside simply because the sun had risen again. (Importantly, I’m not talking about the emotional aftermath of world-rocking life events like the death of a loved one, which is more aptly categorized as grief — and better appreciated as something that will and should take time to nurse.)</p>

<p>I’ve had emotional hangovers after finishing haunting books, receiving hate mail from readers, and getting into disagreements with my spouse.</p>

<p>“The day after something that’s really intense, it’s natural to feel lingering feelings of sadness or shame,” <a href="https://meganbruneau.com/">Megan Bruneau</a>, a therapist and coach, says. The concept reminds her of “vulnerability hangovers,” or uncomfortable feelings like anxiety and regret that can arise after sharing deep emotions, needs, or desires, according to mental health website <a href="https://www.choosingtherapy.com/vulnerability-hangover/">Choosing Therapy</a>. </p>

<p>Per Orloff, frequent emotional hangovers are most common among empaths, highly sensitive people, and those with social anxiety disorder. In other words, when your emotional antenna is highly attuned to others’ thoughts and behaviors, minor social blips become amplified. What’s a breeze on others’ radars is a gust on yours.  </p>

<p>This perspective resonates with Abby Schaeffer, a 33-year-old flight attendant based in New York City. “I feel emotions really deeply — when I get into a fight with someone, I am torn up about it. My partner, by contrast, is like, ‘Well they’re wrong, so whatever,’” she said. “For people like me, emotional hangovers are a thing because you spend so much energy just processing the event.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The brain and body during an emotional hangover&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p>While a hangover-hangover is well-understood as a mix of dehydration, poor quality sleep, and other physical consequences of too much booze, the mechanisms behind emotional hangovers are a little more medically elusive. But experts have some theories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For one, during an emotional experience — say, a confrontation with a slacking colleague — your fight-or-flight system is activated, leading stress hormones like cortisol, norepinephrine, and adrenaline to surge through the body. When the moment passes and your body settles into a “rest and digest” state, you might feel especially worn down. “When we’re repairing after the stress response, it’s tiring,” Bruneau says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The feeling could also reflect the mental tug-of-war between your amygdala, the part of your brain that’s processing your emotions, and your prefrontal cortex, or the part of your brain that’s trying to temper them with logic and decisions. “It’s mentally exhausting to be managing your feelings of anger and anxiety, and trying to be non-reactive,” Bruneau says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some research also shows that highly emotional events light up the brain in certain ways — and that light doesn’t switch off as soon as the event ends. In her <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4468">2016 study</a> in the journal <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, Davachi and colleagues measured people’s brain activity while viewing both emotional and neutral images. They found that the brain states associated with the emotional experiences lingered 20 to 30 minutes later, sharpening the participants’ memory of subsequent non-emotional images.</p>

<p>It shows that, unlike a video recording, “we’re much more complicated in how we’re viewing, perceiving, and remembering the world,” Davachi says.  </p>

<p>Similarly, emotional moments can corrupt our attention — shining the light on happy-looking couples after a fight with your partner, or causing you to misinterpret your friend’s silence after an awkward encounter with a different pal. By ruminating on negative feelings, you’re (often unintentionally) delaying your recovery.   </p>

<p>“Your perception is being heightened toward the things that are relevant to that person or that trauma, but you might actually be suppressing everything else,” Davachi says. “And that’s maladaptive too, because if good stuff is happening to you too, like you get a nice note in the mail, you’re going to not let that improve your mood the way that it should.”</p>

<p>Your emotional hangover might not be so complicated: Maybe you just failed to breathe deeply, or drink enough water, or eat well while engrossed in a tragic movie. Your sleep could have been more fitful too. “When we’re stressed, we tend to not take care of ourselves as well,” Bruneau says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, emotional hangovers are yet another indication that our bodies and minds are connected, <a href="https://chronicillnessandjoy.com/bio.html">Kristen Guest</a>, a licensed social worker, says. “Our bodies are definitely going to feel it if our mind is overpowered or overstimulated. Nothing just happens in a silo.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Your emotional hangover first-aid kit&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Emotional hangovers aren’t inherently bad; they’re human. They might mean you need to set better boundaries or improve communication or practice sitting with uncomfortable emotions and conflict. If you find the feelings are frequent and disruptive, you might need to do something more drastic, like quit a job or break up with a friend. Consider abstinence from the figurative substance that’s no longer serving you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s good to receive those signals in some cases, <em>and</em> we need to train our brains and our bodies to respond in different ways,” Guest says. She recommends drinking lots of water and journaling to help you notice patterns in what, where, and who tends to sap you emotionally. “It’s important to take time for reflection,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Working through it with a therapist can be immensely helpful too, <a href="https://emilysarahhein.com/">Emily Hein</a>, a writer and social work student, has found. She’s learned, for example, that an outsize reaction to her current partner’s comment might be related to something a former partner said. </p>

<p>“We tend to lump all of these things together and it’s really hard to be like, ‘No, let’s just approach this particular situation as it is,’” she says. “It’s definitely a push-pull between your mind and your body, and knowing that you’re safe while also validating that it’s okay for your brain to not feel like it’s safe. Your brain is pulling evidence from things that did happen.” </p>

<p>For her, watching a show, playing a video game, or taking a walk can all put helpful space between the event and her reaction. Like a margarita-induced hangover, time heals, Schaeffer has also found. “Just be kind to yourself the next day,” she says. “That’s the rule I follow.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a beautiful encounter in episode two of the current season of <em>Love Island USA, </em>where contestant Kordell, pressed repeatedly by his partner Serena to open up about his long-term goals, says that he one day aspires to do sponsorships <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@youdidnthearitfrommimi/video/7381677133858524462">for Cheez-Its</a>. It is at this precise moment that I finally start to believe the whispers I’ve heard online and from fellow fans: that for once, the American version of <em>Love Island</em> is more entertaining than its British counterpart.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Love Island</em> is a dating game show in which sexy singles in tiny swimsuits are marooned in a villa in Mallorca and must compete to couple up with each other or risk getting “dumped.” The show has been synonymous with summertime in UK tabloids and water cooler conversations since it first aired in 2015. Six nights per week from June to August, viewers tune in to watch the couples fight and flirt, periodically voting on their favorite contestants. At the grand finale, the most voted-for couple wins a £50,000 prize. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The American version, now in its sixth season, follows pretty much the same formula (instead of Mallorca, it takes place in Fiji, and the prize is $100,000), though it historically never quite managed to capture the magic and messiness of the original, where contestants in a rainbow of distinct British and Irish accents befriend, betray, and literally bone each other on camera.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2161125826.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Two young men sit talking on a balcony ." title="Two young men sit talking on a balcony ." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Aaron and Rob, this season&#039;s bromance. | NBC Universal" data-portal-copyright="NBC Universal" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But despite middling reviews in previous years, season 6 of <em>Love Island USA </em>has finally cracked the code. The show is currently the No. 1 reality series in the US across all streaming platforms, according to Nielsen, and Peacock’s most-watched series by far, gaining twice as many views as last year. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Luminate, an entertainment data tracking company, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/love-island-usa-luminate-streaming-ratings-1236072771/">reports that</a> <em>Love Island USA</em> was the most-watched streaming original series in the US during the second week of July, with 919 million minutes watched, a 257 percent increase from the week it debuted (in a fairly distant second place was <em>The Bear,</em> at 630 million minutes). To be clear, much of this is due to the sheer number of hours available to stream (this season will have around 35 episodes, and previous UK seasons have had nearly 50), but in order to consume 35 hours of television, you’ve got to be pretty invested.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Simon Thomas, the show’s executive producer, points to the charismatic cast as the main reason for this season’s success. “They’re the most ridiculously good-looking group that we’ve probably ever had, and they’re all vulnerable and fun and friendly, like we always want,” tells me. “But there was something about them that you almost couldn’t put your finger on. It’s magic and we’re making a potion, and maybe you get it right.” It’s an alchemy that few reality shows are able to replicate in an era in which many have lost their shock and voyeurism value: With every brilliant <em>Real Housewives</em> cast or compelling <em>Bachelor </em>lead are a million more that end up forgotten in the streaming wasteland. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2159725205.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Two young Black women in bikinis dance by a pool." title="Two young Black women in bikinis dance by a pool." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Serena and JaNa are two fan favorites. | NBC Universal" data-portal-copyright="NBC Universal" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Early seasons of <em>Love Island USA</em> may have struggled in part due to the prudishness of both American values and its laws: Federal broadcasting regulations ban the airing of certain sex acts and swear words on TV, while British reality shows have long featured un-bleeped curses and full-frontal nudity (I’m begging anyone who has not yet had the pleasure to go watch the UK’s <em>Naked Attraction, </em>which the American mind could simply not comprehend).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is also due to the cultural differences of the Islanders: In 2019, one producer <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-television/the-glorious-depravity-of-the-british-love-island">told the New Yorker</a> that “the American contestants were uniformly chaste and polite, their speech sanitized psychobabble cultivated to convey self-awareness, depth, and respect for women.” In contrast, UK Islanders have usually been much more forthcoming about the sex they’re having with each other, openly calling each other “slags,” and frequently discussing whether or not the men are giving them “fanny flutters,” which an American woman <a href="https://ew.com/tv/recaps/bachelor-in-paradise-season-7-episode-8/">might translate to “vagina dance.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.theringer.com/tv/2022/10/20/23414603/love-island-uk-popularity-explained">The Ringer explained</a> at the series’ outset that it could never live up to the original because of Americans’ unwillingness to laugh at themselves. American tastes also tend toward self-serious dating shows like <em>The Bachelor, </em>with its demand that contestants be “here for the right reasons,” i.e. to find love, not fame. <em>Love Island</em> turns the American inclination toward piety and earnestness on its head, acknowledging that, in fact, absolutely nobody is here for the right reasons. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Absolutely nobody is here for the right reasons</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among other things, this season finally replicates the fun of showcasing a buffet of regional accents: Pittsburgher Kaylor doesn’t pronounce her L’s, so words like “told” and “single” sound like “toed” and “singoh.” Professional snake wrangler and <a href="https://x.com/morganpw/status/1811570022604513385">overall wearer</a> Rob’s Alabama twang would come out stronger if he ever sat up fully or spoke louder than a grunt. And Calabasas-based Leah speaks with such a slow SoCal drawl that she sounds like she’s been shot with a poisoned dart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They’ve also sprinkled in a few foreigners, like Liv, an Aussie, Miguel from London, and, most notably, southern England’s Aaron, who has the energy of a rabbit on Red Bull, is best known for having a, er, prominent<em> </em>arc on series two of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24042839/traitors-season-2-us-review-spoilers"><em>The Traitors UK</em></a>, and inexplicably, as the internet has noted, has the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/aaron-girl-doll-teeth">mouth of an American Girl doll</a>. Hilariously, the American Islanders have even started using some of the British slang introduced to the US from the original <em>Love Island: </em>This season, you’ll have the rather uncanny experience of hearing Americans use phrases like “mugged off,” “fit,” “turning heads,” “fanny flutters,” and referring to grilled cheese as “toasties.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s the draw of its new host, <em>Vanderpump Rules’</em> Ariana Madix, who shot to mainstream fame last year after her partner of a decade was caught having an affair with another <em>Vanderpump</em> cast mate, creating the maelstrom that would forever be known as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/6/2/23745691/scandoval-vanderpump-rules-reunion-episode-2-ariana-madix">Scandoval</a>. “Normally the saying in TV is ‘followers don’t follow.’ It’s not enough to book someone who’s got 10 million followers,” Thomas explains. “But Ariana, they would follow her to the moon and back. People care about her in a way I’ve never seen. Her personal story mixes really well with the show.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2157494096.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Ariana Madix in a gold gown on the Love Island USA set." title="Ariana Madix in a gold gown on the Love Island USA set." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Host Ariana Madix chats with the Islanders. | NBC Universal" data-portal-copyright="NBC Universal" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">While this season hasn’t featured many of the genuine love stories that spark sporadically on the island, it has been just as fun to watch friendships form, like the bromance between Rob and Aaron and the sisterhood among the women. Black women, who’ve <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/love-island-needs-black-women_uk_611e3728e4b0c69681055fb2">long been sidelined on <em>Love Island</em></a>, also take a starring role this season in the form of the loveable, princessy JaNa and the spunky Serena, both of whom have seemed to find strong connections in the villa. They and the other women have stuck up for each other in difficult moments and during challenges when the men show themselves to be sexist. One challenge early in the season revealed each Islander’s “body count,” — that is, how many people they’d had sex with. The contestants were also asked how many “bodies” they thought were too many for the opposite gender. When one man, who claimed that he’d had sex with 150 women, said 10 men was too many for a woman, the girls called him out, and he was dumped shortly after. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“For me, that lines right up with the very sex-positive, pro-sex approach that we take on the show,” says Thomas. “Which is to say, we’re not coupling you up to get married, like some sort of puritanical goal of like, if you’re having fun in the sun, you must get married at the end of it. That’s not the purpose of this.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though <em>Love Island USA</em> is now exclusively on streaming and therefore isn’t beholden to federal broadcasting regulations, Thomas says they’re still careful about how much they show — and it’s still less than the UK version. “We watched a cut the other day of a couple having sex, and my thought was, ‘This is too much. It doesn’t add to the story to see this.’ The audience should know they’re having sex, but you do it in a more playful way, where you see a little rustle of a blanket, you hear a giggle. It’s not rocket science.” </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;It’s Thong City in there, which we never could have done on the network”</p><cite>— Simon Thomas</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The swimsuits, however, are sexier than ever: When the show was originally airing on CBS, he says, the contestants weren’t allowed to wear thong bikinis. “We’re bums out all the time now. It’s Thong City in there, which we never could have done on the network.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That <em>Love Island</em> is silly and campy; that there are jiggling bottoms in thongs; that at any moment you are at risk of hearing a dark piano version of Kylie Minogue’s “Can’t Get You Out of My Head,” and that it is emphatically not meant to end with a man down on one knee feels like a much-needed evolution in American reality TV, which, after two decades of perfecting the form, is <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/3/17/24101977/messy-legal-drama-bravo-explained-rachel-leviss-leah-mcsweeney">in a transitional period</a>. Former cast members of series like<em> Love Is Blind</em> and the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bravo-lawsuits-leah-mcsweeney-caroline-manzo-brandi-glanville-explained-2024-3#:~:text=In%20January%202024%2C%20Caroline%20Manzo,Media%20(a%20production%20company%20behind"><em>Real Housewives</em></a> are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/01/nx-s1-5021949/emmily-nussbaum-reality-tv-cue-the-sun#:~:text=One%20suit%2C%20which%20has%20been,false%20imprisonment%20and%20sexual%20assault.">suing production companies</a> for labor violations, pushing alcohol consumption, and turning a blind eye to sexual harassment and assault. <em>Love Island</em> has never been perfect, either; the UK version has seen two former cast members and one host commit suicide after enduring relentless public scrutiny, though new measures have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/aug/22/love-island-and-the-concerns-about-psychological-distress-that-wont-go-away">attempted to address contestants’ mental health</a>. Even in that turbulent landscape, <em>Love Island USA</em> is trying to recapture something that&#8217;s been missing from American reality TV and that the UK version excelled at: fun for its own sake.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans have always had a complicated relationship to hedonism, our first colonists having been shipped away from the British Empire for being literal Puritans. It only took 400-odd years, but perhaps a truly great season of <em>Love Island USA,</em> coupled with a violent desire to escape the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">depressing drip of political news</a>, has finally encouraged us to revel in the basest forms of entertainment. This summer, it’s all about hot people hooking up, falling in love, and confessing their desire to do sponcon for Cheez-Its.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Halfway through the year is a good time to take stock of our reading. The spare elegies of winter have left their mark; the elegant literary novels of spring have come and gone; the big juicy beach reads of summer are just beginning. Let’s pause here and take a look at what good things the year has already brought to us before we look ahead to the riches of the fall. Here are the 10 best books from the first half of 2024.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-ministry-of-time-kaliane-bradley%2F20696241%3Fean%3D9781668045145">The Ministry of Time</a></em></em> by Kaliane Bradley</h2>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/the-ministry-of-time-9781668045145_xlg.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.664339732403,100,34.671320535195" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Ministry of Time&lt;/em&gt; by Kaliane Bradley" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The cover of <em>The Ministry of Time</em>, a debut novel from Kaliane Bradley, features a subtle flex: there’s a blurb from Eleanor Catton, the youngest person ever to win the prestigious Booker Prize for her literary fiction (“outrageously brilliant”) alongside praise from Emily Henry, queen of frothy romcoms like <em>Beach Read</em> (“Electric…I loved every second”). Bradley, we’re being told, can do it all: the beautiful prose with the serious ideas and the smoldering romance. Plus time travel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s most impressive is that <em>The Ministry of Time</em> pretty much lives up to the promises of the cover. The love story is tense and sexy. The sentences unroll smooth and elegant. The exploration of how colonialism rewires our brains is sophisticated and compelling. And the time travel and its after-effects are pretty fascinating.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of <em>The Ministry of Time</em>, the British government has discovered the technology for time travel. To test it, they’ve plucked people out of history right when they would have died. Our unnamed narrator is a government bureaucrat assigned to help a Victorian explorer adjust to life in the 21st century. They fall in love, of course, but it’s a lot more complicated than that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Read if you</em>:<em> </em>like Diana Wynne Jones, Graham Greene wartime spy novels, the first season of <em>Sleepy Hollow</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fhenry-henry-allen-bratton%2F20223706%3Fean%3D9781961884021"><em>Henry Henry</em></a> by Allen Bratton</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Shakespeare’s <em>Henry IV</em>, dissolute Prince Hal has a curious soliloquy. Hal, we know, will grow up to be beloved King Henry V, one of the great warrior kings of England —&nbsp;but right now he’s frittering away his youth on partying and pissing off his dad. But that’s okay, Hal explains to the audience, because he’s being bad on purpose. Later, when he becomes good, his goodness will be all the more impressive because of his past debauchery.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the tension of the three plays that make up the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henriad#Three-play_Henriad">Henriad</a> —&nbsp;Hal’s story — comes from the ambiguity of how seriously you should take Hal’s soliloquy, because his plan doesn’t make all that much sense. It is, however, extremely Catholic, all knotted up around the problems of guilt and pleasure and atonement. That’s an idea debut novelist Allen Bratton fully grasps and explores in <em>Henry Henry</em>, a queer contemporary retelling of the Henriad that leaves behind questions of kingship and England to focus on the issue of Hal’s soul.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>Henry Henry</em>, Hal is one of England’s rare Catholic aristocrats, tormented both by his gayness and by his fraught relationship with his father. He smothers his anguish in dissolute and bitchy debauchery, but he can’t help hating and admiring in equal measure Henry Percy Hotspur, the man Hal’s father wants him to be. The results are gorgeous, sexy, funny, and sad, and Bratton renders them all while taking a palpable pleasure in language that will warm a Shakespearean’s heart.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Read if you:</em> know the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Crispin%27s_Day_Speech">St. Crispin’s Day speech</a> by heart, have opinions on <em>The Hollow Crown</em>, just want a satisfying queer romance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fpractice-rosalind-brown%2F20374769%3Fean%3D9780374613013"><em>Practice</em></a> by Rosalind Brown</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The debut novel from Rosalind Brown tells the deceptively simple story of Oxford undergraduate Annabel as she takes a day to labor over an essay on Shakespeare’s sonnets. Shades of <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em>! (Annabel is a Woolf fan.) In Brown’s precise, elegant prose, we watch Annabel go through the carefully plotted rituals of her day: mint tea upon awakening, which builds to coffee after sufficient examination of the sonnets; a long walk through the town to wake up her mind; the habitual defecation after a too-heavy lunch in the dining hall. All the while, she thinks through her relationship with her older lover, and whether or not she should allow him to disturb the monastic solitude of her work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a deep satisfaction in reading about the details of Annabel’s day —&nbsp;the discipline of the well-chosen activities fighting against the natural sleepy indolence of the mind, and the clear pleasure Annabel takes in exercising her thoughts. Most impressive is Brown’s depiction of having an ongoing fantasy that stretches out for years and that you slip into and out of at odd moments of the day. Annabel is deeply immersed in an imagined romance between two men she has invented, and she flits through scenes of their life as she gets bored or distracted. It&nbsp;rings deeply true to life, in a way I have never quite seen an author conjure before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Read accompanied by</em>: a piece of very crisp toast, lightly buttered, and a cup of deep amber Darjeeling tea to savor.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fgreat-expectations-vinson-cunningham%2F20028586%3Fean%3D9780593448236">Great Expectations</a></em> by Vinson Cunningham</h2>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Great-Expectations.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.307347839006,100,35.385304321987" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;Great Expectations&lt;/em&gt; (not that one) by Vinson Cunningham | Hogarth" data-portal-copyright="Hogarth" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Great Expectations</em> is the first novel by New Yorker cultural critic Vinson Cunningham, who displays an admirable hubris in his decision to give his book one of the best-known titles in the English corpus. Loosely based on Cunningham’s experience working on the first Obama presidential campaign in 2008, it takes place almost entirely within the presidential campaign of a figure Cunningham will call only “the Senator” or “the Candidate.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">David, Cunningham’s protagonist, is a college dropout and single dad who feels aimless. Desperate, he parlays his high school reputation for brilliance into a job working with the campaign everyone is talking about: the first-term senator who may just become America’s first Black president.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cunningham seeds his narrative with the kind of inside baseball shop talk that political junkies will adore. He relishes little details like where campaign staffers sleep while they’re in the field; how they learn to watch the faces of the crowd when the Candidate speaks so they know who to ask for checks at the end; how they remind benefit attendees to follow “airplane rules” as they make their way through metal detectors to get close to the Candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">David sketches out this minutiae not because he’s interested in politics, exactly, but because he’s interested in small and telling grace notes. He likes to notice the way a preacher holds his microphone, or the way wealthy Black donors call Martha’s Vineyard “the island.” This is a novel of manners, where the signifiers of class and aesthetics take on enormous weight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In part, Cunningham suggests, that’s because at the dawn of the Obama era, it felt as though everything might symbolize something else. Pop culture could mean politics and politics could mean pop culture. Your taste in music could speak to your ethics. One man’s political victory might mean the end of American racism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the drama of the novel is the way David is at first seduced by these ideas and then discards them. The whole way through, Cunningham’s sentences are so perfectly balanced you feel you could rap them with a stick and they would ring like crystal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Read alongside</em>: Henry James’s <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-bostonians-henry-james/6767782?ean=9780140437669"><em>The Bostonians</em></a>, the true 19th-century analogue to this novel. (Dickens is a red herring!)&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fyou-dreamed-of-empires-alvaro-enrigue%2F19997322%3Fean%3D9780593544792"><em>You Dreamed of Empires</em></a> by Álvaro Enrigue, translated by Natasha Wimmer&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>You Dreamed of Empires</em> takes place over the course of one day in 1519, as the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrives with his retinue in what is now Mexico City. Then, it was Tenochtitlán, the seat of the emperor Moctezuma and the Aztec empire.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Spanish plan to sack the city. Moctezuma plans to steal their horses, the sole technological improvement the Spanish seem to have on the lavish Aztec way of life. Over the course of the novel, people sneak around the various sumptuous palaces, nibbling at hallucinogens and trying to figure out if today is the day they’ll be beheaded, tortured, or ritually executed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet despite the bloodiness of the setting, this is a playful and witty book. Enrigue is interested in how people in dangerous proximity to power manage their lives and their own status. He is interested, also, in the arbitrary flow of history, of how easily <em>this</em> moment might have become <em>that</em> one instead. His prose is hallucinatory, kaleidoscopic. As Moctezuma trips on magic mushrooms, he sees Enrigue writing <em>You Dreamed of Empires</em> and hears T. Rex’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlRx_Ky7A6c">Monolith</a>.” I promise, it all makes sense in context.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Read accompanied by</em>: thick, rich mole and the smokiest mezcal you can find.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-hunter-tana-french%2F20155404%3Fean%3D9780593493434"><em>The Hunter</em></a> by Tana French</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tana French developed a cult following writing rich, chewy literary thrillers, full of propulsive pacing and murder mysteries so carefully thought out they doubled as character studies for the detectives who investigated them. French built her name on her <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/11/27/20978200/tana-french-dublin-murder-series">Dublin Murder Squad series</a>, which focused on a crew of Irish detectives and their fraught, vexed relationships with their partners in crime-solving. That ended in 2016, and her most recent books (2020’s <em>The Searcher</em> in addition to <em>The Hunter</em>) have begun to form their own series, all about parents and children.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The parent and child in question here aren’t technically related. Cal is a Chicago cop who’s moved to the tiny Irish village of Ardnakelty to live out his retirement. Trey is a half-feral teenage girl from the wrong side of town whose father Johnny walked out and whose older brother is missing. In <em>The Searcher</em>, she gets Cal to go looking for the brother. By the time <em>The Hunter</em> rolls around, the whole town understands that Cal has unofficially adopted Trey —&nbsp;which makes matters difficult when Johnny returns to get the locals to buy into a new get-rich-quick scheme he’s cooked up. (<em>The Hunter</em> does not really make sense if you have not read <em>The Searcher</em>, although it’s by and large a more consistent novel than its predecessor.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Cal struggles to find a way to protect a girl over whom he has no legal rights, Trey and Johnny redevelop their own wary, mercenary relationship. The great question of this book is what parents and children owe to each other, and what such a bond should look like. French, as is her wont, offers us no easy answers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What a strange and satisfying novel <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/356053/miranda-july-all-fours-idea-of-you-age-gap-menopause"><em>All Fours</em></a> is. It concerns an unnamed narrator, a performance artist who, upon coming into a windfall of $20,000, plans to blow it all on a cross-country road trip to New York and a lavish hotel room. Instead, she ends up at a crummy motel in the first suburb she comes across, spending all her new money on redecorating the motel room to her precise specifications: pink, with Louis Vuitton furniture, botanical wallpaper, tonka bean-scented diffusers, and an antique pink quilt on the bed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The motel room starts as a place in which the narrator can conduct a steamy but sexless affair with a younger man. Over the course of the novel, it becomes a place for her to work, to commune with her friends, to be fully herself. <em>All Fours</em> is a quirky-smart dissection of women, aging, desire, and marriage all in one. What are the chances?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Read if you</em>: would like to paint your Room of Your Own a tasteful shade of pink; really felt Fleabag when she said her greatest fear was losing the currency of youth.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-practice-the-horizon-and-the-chain-sofia-samatar%2F20001588%3Fean%3D9781250881809"><em>The Practice, the Horizon, and the Chain</em></a> by Sofia Samatar</h2>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/9781250881809.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,33.641468061083,100,32.717063877833" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="&lt;em&gt;The Practice, the Horizon, and the Chain&lt;/em&gt;, by Sofia Samatar | Tordotcom" data-portal-copyright="Tordotcom" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">This novella is an elegant and thoughtful take on Ursula K. Le Guin’s famous “<a href="https://shsdavisapes.pbworks.com/f/Omelas.pdf">The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas</a>.” Le Guin’s short story imagines a beautiful paradise that is made to function because of a single child who is being tortured in a basement. Samatar’s novella imagines a fleet of spaceships powered by an underclass held in chains below decks, and a professor who develops a scholarship program to bring one of the boys in chains to the world above.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The allegory Samatar develops in this world is rich and compelling, but what strikes me most about the world she’s built is how fully she’s imagined its physical details. When the boy comes up to the upper levels for the first time in his life, he’s untethered from the chain that attaches him to everyone below deck. Without their counterbalancing weight, he has to relearn how to walk.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What a quietly devastating detail. What a completely imagined world Samatar has built in these slight pages.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Read accompanied by:</em> A small and exquisite bowl of fish soup, something like bouillabaisse scented with saffron, and a glass of good chilled white wine.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fcommitted-a-meditation-on-grief-madness-and-meaning-suzanne-scanlon%2F20272661%3Fean%3D9780593469101"><em>Committed: On Meaning and Madwomen</em></a> by Suzanne Scanlon</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Toward the end of <em>Committed</em>, Suzanne Scanlon’s layered and lovely new book that is part memoir, part literary history, the author recalls recounting her medical history to a new psychiatrist. She mentions that in her early 20s, she spent three years in the New York State Psychiatric Institute.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new psychiatrist protests: Such a thing couldn’t possibly have happened. Everyone knows that you don’t keep mental patients hospitalized for so long. It makes them worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, Scanlon replies, she knows. She lived through it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scanlon checked herself into the hospital as a 20-year-old college student in 1992 after a suicide attempt. The place was a panopticon: dorms and common spaces radiating out in spokes from a central nurse’s station, where a portrait of Freud kept a watchful eye over all the patients. Fresh air and exercise weren’t considered part of the treatment plan; patients stayed inside all day, smoking and watching television.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the hospital, Scanlon’s doctors, she writes, “needed me to get better and instead I got better at being sick.” She craved their attention and care, and she learned to perform her illness in ways her doctors found legible and diagnosable. She would later learn that the hospital was in the midst of a debate over what to do with people like Scanlon. It was the dawn of the SSRI era, and doctors were torn. Should depression be treated like a chemical imbalance? Or was Freudian talk therapy the only true cure?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scanlon’s treatment plans swung uneasily from one to the other as conflicting models ruled the day at the hospital. When she finally got out, it wasn’t because she was deemed cured or even better. It was because the state stopped funding inpatient therapy for that long.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the end, what was most healing to Scanlon was the vast body of writing by and about women and madness and hospitalization: Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf and Audre Lorde and Marguerite Duras. It’s through reading and rereading their work that she’s able to find a skeleton of meaning regarding what happened to her in the years she lived in the hospital —&nbsp;and a way of thinking about her own identity that doesn’t require a fixed idea of selfhood.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Read equipped with</em>: pen and paper to take notes of all the books Scanlon talks about that you’ll want to read by the time she’s done with you.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2009, Colm Tóibín published <em>Brooklyn</em>, a quietly stunning portrait of how young Eilis Lacey makes her way from her small Irish town of Enniscorthy to America in the 1950s. With <em>Long Island</em>, he picks up Eilis’s story again in the 1970s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Eilis is middle-aged now, and a mother, settled with her husband Tony in a cul-de-sac populated entirely by his extended Italian American family on Long Island. Eilis sometimes finds herself isolated in this large clan of in-laws, and fights multiple pitched battles of wills against Tony’s mother. Still, she’s largely content with her life —&nbsp;until she learns that Tony has slept with someone else, his mistress is pregnant, and the plan is to leave the baby with Eilis and Tony.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The baby will not pass the threshold,” Eilis tells Tony, who doesn’t dare to disagree with her face-to-face but won’t acquiesce either. So Eilis packs up her things and goes back to Enniscorthy for the first time in 20 years. If the baby is in her house when she returns, she decides, she simply won’t move back in with Tony. But once in Enniscorthy, she finds that she can’t quite turn her back on her past as easily as she’d like to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tóibín’s genius is the quietness of his worlds. His characters always exist at a slight remove from their own actions, unable to quite see why they’re making the choices they’ve made, try as they might to analyze and rationalize after the fact. With Eilis’s return home, he’s given us a portrait of middle-aged regrets, handled so lightly that he makes it look easy. It’s not.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the stranger narratives to emerge from the Republican National Convention this past week is the reception of Usha Vance. Usha is married to Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, former President Donald Trump’s pick for vice president. Should Trump and Vance win in November, Usha will be the second lady of the United States. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Viewers noted that Usha’s heritage and identity — Usha’s parents are South Asian immigrants and she’s of Indian descent — appear to be at odds with her husband’s and the larger party’s politics, specifically the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23484314/trump-fuentes-ye-dinner-white-nationalism-supremacy">implicitly racist and explicitly xenophobic parts</a>. Usha introduced herself and her husband at the convention on Wednesday, after speakers spent most of the previous day hammering home <a href="https://x.com/Young25Tim/status/1813732725091922330">anti-immigrant rhetoric</a>, some dipping into extremist fear-mongering and accusing <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop">immigrants of rape and murder</a>. Despite previously <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian">insulting Trump</a>, her husband’s political stance has, of late, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/us/politics/jd-vance-abortion-immigration-issues.html">closely resembled the former president’s</a>, including <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jd-vance-deport-20-million-immigrants-reduce-home-prices-rents-2024-7">anti-immigrant</a> sentiment. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While she spoke, the audience waved “mass deportation” signs — ostensibly not directly at her but in support of the general anti-immigration stance of the Republican platform. Perhaps it’s not surprising that far-right Republicans have begun <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/18/rnc-convention-usha-vance-maga-attacks/">attacking Usha</a> and denigrating her and her husband’s mixed-race family.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The perceived conflict between Usha’s background and Republican politics has created another reaction, too, one steeped in a particular stripe of sexism: that Usha is somehow a victim or reluctant participant in, if not a hostage to, her husband’s political ambitions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some political reporters have started to “read” her body language, surmising that she’s “<a href="https://x.com/jbendery/status/1814136365329641709">uneasy</a>” or unwilling to be in this position. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/who-is-jd-vances-wife-usha-and-why-isnt-she-raring-to-become-second-lady">The Daily Beast</a> took one moment of Usha looking at her husband during the convention, and came to the conclusion that this was a woman trapped: stuck in love with a man who made a Faustian bargain with Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“But then the smile faded and at other moments she appeared fatigued and had a ‘What am I doing here?’ look,” the Daily Beast’s Michael Daly wrote. He added, “And when he and Usha gazed at each other there was a spark of what appeared to be true love, even in MAGAland. Then she had a look that made you hope that the heart will prove to be enough when your husband has sold his soul.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From mannerism analysis to the musings about love in a hopeless place to the “poor Usha” projection, it all assumes that Usha Vance ultimately disapproves of her husband’s political ideologies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Usha is not a shrinking violet nor a political babe in the woods: she graduated from Yale Law School, just like her husband, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/usha-vance-attorney-jd-vance-wife-vp-63406da4f6739546391ed7797fc1fef2">clerked</a> for conservative judges like Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, when he was still an appeals court judge, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/style/usha-vance-jd-vance.html">then</a> for Chief Justice John Roberts. Later, she worked as a trial lawyer at a white-shoe law firm. As of 2022, she was registered as a Republican in Ohio, where her husband ran for Senate.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2162463444.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A sea of white people, many wearing cowboy hats and US flag shirts, wave signs that read &quot;Mass deportation now.&quot;" title="A sea of white people, many wearing cowboy hats and US flag shirts, wave signs that read &quot;Mass deportation now.&quot;" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The crowd that Usha Vance, a daughter of South Asian immigrants, was speaking to at the Republican National Convention. | Alex Wong/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Alex Wong/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">If that “silently disapproving wife” trope sounds familiar, it’s because political reporters and commentators <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/01/on-pitying-melania/514409/">portrayed former first lady Melania Trump</a> in a similar fashion. Some even went so far as positing a fantasy that she <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/mar/21/jimmy-kimmel-melania-trump-late-night-tv">secretly hates him</a>. It wasn’t until recordings of <a href="https://www.vox.com/21497443/melania-trump-recording-tapes">Melania</a> downplaying the separation of migrant families at the border leaked in 2020 that the myth of Melania being an unwilling partner to her husband was shattered. Still, some continue to <a href="https://okmagazine.com/p/donald-trump-ridiculed-wife-melania-avoid-kissing-lips-rnc/">perpetuate that idea</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former second lady Karen Pence was often <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/matthew-tully/2014/12/04/tully-karen-pence-discusses-political-parenting-liberal-daughter/19890425/">quoted</a> as being apolitical and non-influential when it came to her husband’s politics too, as he served in Congress and as governor of Indiana. It created the impression that she was some kind of spiritual bystander. But when he was picked by Trump, her facade dropped and she was revealed to be one of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/karen-pence-is-the-vice-presidents-prayer-warrior-gut-check-and-shield/2017/03/28/3d7a26ce-0a01-11e7-8884-96e6a6713f4b_story.html">biggest Trump supporters</a> in the former veep’s inner circle. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether it’s people <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/31/opinions/heidi-cruz-deserves-better-donald-trump-hossain/index.html">feeling awful for Heidi Cruz</a>, insisting that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/politics/tiffany-trump-wedding/index.html">Tiffany Trump is not close</a> to her family even though she keeps appearing at big events, hoping against all odds about <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2004/08/why-liberals-shouldn-t-like-laura-bush.html">Laura Bush’s beliefs</a>, or speculating about <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/06/is-there-a-hidden-hillary-clinton-vote-among-women/">secret Hillary voters</a> in Trumpland, there’s an inclination to distance Republican women from the Republican men they support.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Data about mixed political marriage isn’t extensive, but according to <a href="https://ifstudies.org/blog/marriages-between-democrats-and-republicans-are-extremely-rare#:~:text=Today%2C%20only%2021%25%20of%20marriages,compared%20because%20of%20different%20methods.">an analysis</a> of Deseret News and Brigham Young University’s <a href="https://media.deseret.com/media/misc/pdf/afs/2023-american-family-survey.pdf?_gl=1*2d9gns*_ga*MTYwNjc2NjcxNC4xNzIxNDIxNDUx*_ga_YNRPD2MVFD*MTcyMTQyMTQ1MS4xLjEuMTcyMTQyMjQ5Ni41NS4wLjA.">2023 American Family Survey</a>, only 21 percent of marriages are politically mixed and roughly just 4 percent are between Democrats and Republicans. People don’t tend to marry people whose political beliefs stray too far from their own. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The left-leaning rationalization about Usha Vance and her ilk is a type of <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2016/11/15/13571478/trump-president-sexual-assault-sexism-misogyny-won">benevolent sexism</a>, the idea that women are naturally the kinder, gentler sex, in need of protection and unwilling to voice their true opinions. On the surface, the act doesn’t seem overtly malicious — hence the “benevolence.” But ascribing these traits to women undercuts their autonomy and attempts to exonerate them from their own choices.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Usha’s case, any look that could be interpreted as dismay — when in reality it could be fatigue, or even simply a lack of media training — is a signal to some that she’s a damsel in distress. Certainly a woman with her education and resume would be very capable of divorcing a husband she fully disagrees with. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The only person who knows what Usha’s true intentions are or how she really feels about her husband and his politics is Usha Vance herself. She could very well share some of the sentiments of the benevolently sexist narrative that’s been created about her. She could also be sitting on those reservations for her own private reasons, from love to ambition and anything in between. The more likely possibility, though, is that she does not disagree with J.D. Vance. A completely reasonable thing to assume is that his politics are her politics, even if that’s hard for some to accept. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the political vitriol she’s already facing from her husband’s own party, that does paint a complicated picture. To some, that’s why she’ll always need saving — even if it’s in the form of melodramatic fanfic.</p>

<p>Air travel is inherently stressful. You need to ensure you give yourself enough time to get to the airport, and, once there, you have to contend with potentially long lines at bag drop and security. Without fail, you either have too much time or no time at all at the gate before boarding. Aside from timing, many of the conditions around air travel are out of the passenger’s control, including flight cancellations and delays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the United States, just under 20 percent of flights have been delayed in 2024, according to the US Department of Transportation’s <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/homedrillchart.asp">Bureau of Transportation Statistics</a>. And on Friday, more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/travel/tech-outage-us-airlines-ground-stops.html">than 2,400 flights were canceled</a> across the country and thousands more delayed <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/361740/crowdstrike-outage-windows">as a massive tech outage</a> touching multiple industries caused chaos in airports.<strong> </strong>Stranded at the airport, frustrated passengers may feel out of options. But you do have a few cards in your hand: reschedule, refund, request, or wait it out. Here are some answers to help you make a plan should you find yourself waiting out a delayed or canceled flight.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What causes flight delays and cancellations?</h2>

<p>The DOT’s Bureau of Transportation Statistics <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp">tracks the causes of flight delays</a>. For the past few years, air carrier delays and airplanes arriving late have been the <a href="https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp?20=E">most common reasons</a> for flight delays. A <a href="https://aspm.faa.gov/aspmhelp/index/Types_of_Delay.html">carrier delay includes</a> circumstances like cleaning the airplane, damage to the plane, waiting for connecting passengers or crew to arrive, fueling, and maintenance — all of which are controllable by the airline.</p>

<p>The second-most common cause for a flight delay was the aircraft arriving late — which can be caused by weather. In 2021, weather accounted for <a href="https://www.bts.gov/content/weathers-share-delay-percent-total-delay-minutes-year">26 percent</a> of total delays that year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The causes for <a href="https://www.bts.gov/topics/airlines-and-airports/understanding-reporting-causes-flight-delays-and-cancellations">flight cancellations are the same as delays</a>: air carrier, extreme weather, National Aviation System issues (like non-extreme weather, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control), and security (like needing to evacuate, or reboard because of a security breach or long lines at security).</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP3933799602" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I have an upcoming flight. What can I do to prepare?</h2>

<p>Before you leave for the airport, make sure you’ve signed up for text alerts and downloaded the airline’s app (turn on its notifications) or the <a href="https://flightaware.com/mobile/">FlightAware</a> app to get real-time flight information. If your flight is delayed or canceled well in advance, you can make adjusted plans from the comfort of a hotel or loved one’s home instead of the chaos of the airport.</p>

<p>Take a few photos of your luggage so that if it gets lost down the line, you can provide an accurate description of what it looks like. Travel expert Gary Leff of the travel blog <a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/">View from the Wing</a> also recommends putting an Apple AirTag in your luggage so you can track your suitcase’s exact location, whether it’s halfway across the country or at baggage claim.</p>

<p>Familiarize yourself with the services your airline provides in the event of a delay or cancellation so you know how to advocate for yourself and other passengers. The DOT’s <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/airline-customer-service-dashboard">Airline Customer Service Dashboard</a> details various amenities airlines have committed to providing should a flight be canceled for reasons the airline can control, like maintenance or crew problems, but not weather. These services include rebooking your ticket for free on the same airline (or a partner airline) or a meal voucher for delays longer than three hours.</p>

<p>Your credit card might also offer trip delay coverage or baggage delay coverage where the cost of your hotel, meals, and expenses are reimbursed. Chase Sapphire Reserve, the Platinum Card from American Express, and Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card are among the <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/credit-cards/cards-with-trip-delay-reimbursement/">credit cards offering these protections</a>, but check your credit card contract for exact details.</p>

<p>Some airlines, like <a href="https://www.united.com/ual/en/us/fly/travel/change-fee.html">United</a> and <a href="https://www.delta.com/us/en/travel-planning-center/change-or-cancel-your-trip/cancel-change-requirements">Delta</a>, don’t have change fees for economy tickets and above, so you can change your flight for free if a delay is stretching on longer than you’d like and there’s a more convenient flight on the same air carrier. Check with your airline to make sure you’re not paying extra if you do try to change your flight.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My flight is perpetually delayed. I need to get out of this airport.</h2>

<p>For delays that extend overnight due to controllable issues, many airlines — including American, Delta, Spirit, Southwest, and United — offer complimentary hotel accommodations, per the DOT Airline Customer Service Dashboard. Many of these airlines provide free transportation to the hotel, too. Extreme weather doesn’t fall under the “controllable” reasons an airline would offer these services, but if you’re stuck due to a weather delay, it’s still worth asking.</p>

<p>Passengers dealing with <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds">“significant” delays are entitled to a full refund</a> should they choose not to travel. The DOT hasn’t defined what constitutes a “significant” delay, but rather decides on a case-by-case basis taking into account the length of the delay and the length of the flight. Under normal circumstances, refunds are issued fairly quickly, Leff says.</p>

<p>For airlines that won’t cover hotel stays and meals, go to the baggage service office in baggage claim and ask about the <a href="https://www.smartertravel.com/stuck-at-the-airport-request-a-hotel-distressed-traveler-rate/">distressed traveler rate</a>, Leff says. “When the airline is not paying for the hotel, they may have discounts available on hotels through their own negotiated rates, and the hotels provide that discount because they want the business from the airline,” he explains. “So you may get a better rate than if you were booking directly yourself. It’s not a publicly available rate.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My flight was canceled. What now?</h2>

<p>Regardless of the reason for cancellation, every passenger is <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/individuals/aviation-consumer-protection/refunds">entitled to a full refund</a> should they choose not to rebook.</p>

<p>For delays and cancellations, Leff says the best course of action is to avoid long lines at the airline counter at the airport. “Standing in hours and hours-long lines is probably not going to get you information that’s even going to be useful,” he says. But do exhaust all of your options: Try calling, getting in touch via social media, chatting through the mobile app or with staff at the club level, looking at other flight options on other airlines, or plotting a route via train or bus. “You are best off looking at flight options yourself as though you were buying anew, knowing that with a canceled flight you’ll get your money back, and then you have at least the option to submit to Southwest receipts for some level of reimbursement,” Leff says of passengers dealing with that particular situation.</p>

<p>Just remember the airline staff, on the phone and at the airport, are not responsible for your travel headaches and are not the people on whom to unleash your frustrations. Be nice.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">I finally landed. Where’s my luggage?</h2>

<p>Sometimes passengers get separated from their luggage, leaving people without clothes and toiletries in a new location. When your bags don’t make it to your destination, speak with a member of airport staff immediately. They may have paperwork for you to fill out describing the physical attributes of your suitcase and its contents. Hopefully, the airport can locate and deliver your bag to you in a timely manner. (Before you depart, make sure there are no irreplaceable items, like keys, or things you’ll need immediately, like medication, in your checked luggage.)</p>

<p>The most an airline can pay a passenger for permanently lost luggage <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/airconsumer/fly-rights#Baggage">is $3,800</a> for domestic flights. Again, airlines may reimburse you for items you needed to purchase while your suitcase was missing, so keep receipts.</p>

<p>When it comes to air travel, there are many factors that can, and at some point, will, go awry. Have a plan (and a backup plan), know what expenses airlines will cover, and try to anticipate potential headaches.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign has two faces.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From one angle, the operation looks disorientingly competent and normal: The Republican nominee has pivoted to the center on various hot-button issues and sought to broaden his base with symbolic overtures to traditionally Democratic constituencies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From another angle, it looks like a deeply weird, somewhat fascistic reality star’s personality cult — because it is.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tension between these tendencies was on lurid display at this week’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360897/rnc-republican-national-convention-trump-vance-takeaways-live-updates">Republican National Convention</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the behest of Trump and his allies, the RNC approved a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-pushes-new-gop-platform-softening-partys-positions-abortion-sex-rcna160730">new GOP platform</a>, one free of calls for federal abortion bans or any explicit opposition to same-sex marriage. The Republicans’ official agenda also forswears any cuts to Medicare and Social Security, including increases to the retirement age. All of these stances contradict longstanding conservative movement goals, and all three bring the Republican Party into <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/07/social-security-medicare-budget-cuts-poll/11621677002/">closer</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-trump-biden-election-2024-dobbs-498d14f6e2bbfe1f313f006ad089de4e">alignment</a> with <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/506636/sex-marriage-support-holds-high.aspx">public opinion</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Trump used some of the RNC’s primetime speaking slots to signal sympathy for nonwhite voters, younger Americans, and union members. The biracial model and rapper Amber Rose <a href="https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/amber-rose-speaks-at-rnc-2024-night-one">gave a speech</a> that invited young, historically liberal voters to rethink their skepticism of Trump and his party. “The truth is that the media has lied to us about Donald Trump. I know this because for a long time I believed those lies,” Rose declared, explaining that she eventually realized, “Donald Trump and his supporters don’t care if you’re Black, white, gay, or straight. It’s all love. And that’s when it hit me. These are my people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The RNC’s outreach to union voters was even more concerted. On the convention’s first night, Teamsters president Sean O’Brien enjoyed the most prominent speaking slot. The union leader did not actually endorse Trump and spent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/teamsters-president-rnc-what-matters/index.html">much of his address</a> on diatribes against corporate greed that received tepid support in the convention hall. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To all but the most attentive viewers, however, O’Brien’s status as the keynote speaker overshadowed the absence of a formal endorsement: By all appearances, the head of one of America’s largest unions was vouching for Trump’s commitment to workers’ interests.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taken together, the RNC’s four-day infomercial for Trump’s GOP was far more professionally orchestrated and broadly accessible than its 2020 and 2016 predecessors, which often seemed to be made by and for Fox News addicts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet other aspects of the convention betrayed the strange, illiberal, and authoritarian character of Trump’s politics. As well-managed as the Trump campaign has been to this point, it cannot escape the inherent liabilities of the man it’s trying to sell. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Trump’s disconcertingly appealing, illiberal oddity&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not all of these elements were necessarily unstrategic. No Republican nominee but Donald Trump would give primetime RNC speaking slots to Hulk Hogan or Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White. The appearances weren’t all smooth — at one point, Hogan referred to the GOP nominee as “<a href="https://x.com/derrickgott007/status/1814112774223753270">Donald Dick J. Trump</a>” — but to the extent that Trump’s team is hoping to consolidate its apparent gains <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351563/one-explanation-for-the-2024-elections-biggest-mystery">with low-information, younger voters</a>, conveying a spirit of irreverence and fun might be well-advised. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, the convention’s messaging on immigration was at once <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop">grotesquely hateful and plausibly popular</a>. During his nomination acceptance speech, Trump reiterated one of his favorite and most cartoonish lies: that the inflow of migrants to the United States is not driven by the political instability and economic challenges of some Central and South American countries, but rather, by those nations’ diabolical plot to ship all of their most violent miscreants across our border. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country,” Trump declared. “They’re coming from prisons. They’re coming from jails. They’re coming from mental institutions and insane asylums.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One would hope that the message conveyed by rhetoric this unhinged would be: “I am a liar and I think that you are stupid.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump’s words could just as plausibly reinforce the impression that he won’t let any nagging sympathies for asylum seekers prevent him from getting tough on border security. The American public’s mood is now more nativist than it has been in decades. In April, a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/25/trump-biden-americans-illegal-immigration-poll">survey from Axios</a> and the Harris Poll found 51 percent of Americans expressing support for “mass deportations” (a policy that RNC attendees promoted by holding up “Mass Deportations Now” signs). And this month, for the first time since 2005, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx">Gallup</a> found a majority of Americans (55 percent) saying that immigration to the United States should be decreased.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, other manifestations of Trump’s ineradicable oddity and illiberalism are political liabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Trump’s strategically unwise, ideologically fitting VP pick</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among these is the selection of J.D. Vance as the Republican nominee for vice president. The Ohio senator is an unaccomplished and largely untested politician, one who has publicly taken a variety of extreme and unpopular issue stances.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance won his Senate seat in 2022 by just a six-point margin, in a year when the national popular vote favored Republicans by roughly three points. For context, in 2020, when Joe Biden won the popular vote by four points, Trump won Ohio by eight. Thus, Vance underperformed Trump significantly in an election cycle that was much more favorable to their party. And this is the only election campaign that Vance, a hit <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/360909/jd-vance-how-true-is-hillbilly-elegy-classism">memoirist</a> and businessman, has ever run. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Trump’s running mate <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/17/jd-vance-abortion-comstock-vice-presidential-nominee/">signed a letter in 2023</a> imploring the Justice Department to halt the delivery of all abortion pills, in accordance with a controversial interpretation of an obscure federal law. Two years earlier, Vance <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/vance-abortion-rape/2021/09/24/c3007318-1d32-11ec-8380-5fbadbc43ef8_story.html">argued</a> that even victims of rape and incest should not be allowed to obtain abortions because “two wrongs don’t make a right.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance distanced himself from these statements in recent weeks without outright renouncing them. On <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-july-7-2024-n1310187"><em>Meet the Press</em></a> earlier this month, the Ohio senator said that “the Supreme Court made a decision saying that the American people should have access” to mifepristone under existing federal law and that he supports honoring that decision. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html">told</a> Fox News’s Sean Hannity this week that “Donald Trump is the leader of the Republican Party, and his views on abortion are going to be the views that dominate this party and drive this party forward,” and that he therefore supported abortion being left to the states for the foreseeable future. In both cases, though, Vance framed his moderation as an act of deference to another authority. He did not say that he personally believes access to an abortion should be an inviolable right in some circumstances or that the federal government should not restrict access to abortion pills. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance has also <a href="https://ctnewsjunkie.com/2024/07/17/in-private-speech-j-d-vance-said-the-devil-is-real-and-praised-alex-jones-as-a-truth-teller/">suggested</a> that the far-right conspiracy theorist (and Sandy Hook truther) Alex Jones is largely right about the American power structure, as “a transnational financial elite controls things in our country” and these elites “hate our society” and “are probably sex perverts too.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most critically, Vance is among the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian">most openly authoritarian</a> Republicans in Washington. He has said that he would have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/05/vance-trump-upend-democracy/">helped Trump overturn the 2020 election results,</a> raised money <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html">for January 6 rioters</a>, called on the DOJ to launch a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/12/07/trump-dictatorship-retribution-jd-vance-robert-kagan/">criminal investigation</a> against an anti-Trump Washington Post columnist, touted plans for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-host-abruptly-ends-interview-jd-vance-supreme-court-remarks-no-no-george">consolidating the president’s authority</a> over the federal bureaucracy, and argued that Trump should simply defy any court orders that obstruct such a power grab. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Traditionally, presidential candidates use their VP picks to assuage potential concerns that swing voters might have about them or balance out the ticket demographically. Vance’s selection, by contrast, exacerbates Trump’s biggest political liabilities: the perception that he is an authoritarian extremist whose election would threaten abortion rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, Trump picked him precisely because Vance’s current ideology closely mirrors his own. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-tim-alberta.html">the Atlantic’s Tim Alberta</a>, the Trump campaign had initially planned to pick a milquetoast, unthreatening running mate, such as North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. But Trump was eventually persuaded that he needed a fellow true-believing populist to help him enact his most far-reaching ambitions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The Achilles’ heel of Donald Trump’s campaign is Donald Trump</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most politically damaging manifestation of Trump’s weirdness and authoritarianism at the RNC, however, was the candidate’s own address.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican nominee’s acceptance speech was the longest ever given, meandering across <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184032/trump-insanely-boring-long-rnc-speech">92 bizarre and tedious minutes</a>. This excess was a direct reflection of the authoritarian nature of Trump’s candidacy. The nominee of a healthy democratic political party must balance their own narcissistic appetite for attention against the interests of the various constituencies they represent. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Having consolidated his personality cult’s control of the GOP, Trump faced no such constraint. His speech did not stretch to marathon length because of its abundance of substantive content. Rather, it consumed so much time because Trump allowed himself to supplement nearly every passage with pointless and tiresome ad-libbing, after detailing his own narrowly averted assassination in painstaking detail. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A less weird and authoritarian Republican nominee might have also drummed up panic about undocumented immigration. But they probably wouldn’t have paused in the middle of such demagogy to ask the crowd, “Has anyone seen <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>?” and then say, incongruously, “The late, great Hannibal Lecter.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s endless, self-indulgent rambling was alienating enough in and of itself. Even more unnerving was the spectacle of an increasingly bored crowd struggling to humor their dear leader with increasingly strained outbursts of enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 Trump campaign is a highly professional operation, run by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-campain-election-2024-susie-wiles-chris-lacivita/678806/">two of the most accomplished consultants</a> in Republican politics, and much of the RNC reflected their savvy. But no matter how cleverly you package Trump, the flaws in the fundamental product remain. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican nominee is unpopular, odd, authoritarian, and beatable. Democrats despondent over their own standard-bearer’s shortcomings should not embrace defeatism, but rather, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361597/biden-drop-out-democrats-obama-pelosi-schumer">get themselves a normal and age-appropriate nominee</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s something I’m embarrassed to admit: Even though I’ve been reporting on <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/27/18518598/ai-facial-recognition-ban-apple-amazon-microsoft">the problems</a> with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/16/18625137/ai-facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco-surveillance">facial recognition</a> for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/08/china-surveillance-technology-muslims/567443/">half a dozen years</a>, I have allowed my face to be scanned at airports. Not once. Not twice. Many times.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are lots of reasons for that. For one thing, traveling is stressful. I feel time pressure to make it to my gate quickly and social pressure not to hold up long lines. (This alone makes it feel like I’m not truly consenting to the face scans so much as being coerced into them.) Plus, I’m always getting “randomly selected” for additional screenings, maybe because of my Middle Eastern background. So I get nervous about doing anything that might lead to extra delays or interrogations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the main reason I haven’t declined airport face scans is actually very simple: I had no idea I could opt out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It turns out that saying no is not only doable, but <a href="https://keepbeyond.com/optout/">surprisingly easy</a> —&nbsp;at least in theory. Everyone, regardless of citizenship, can opt out when it comes to domestic flights in the US. (For international flights, US citizens can opt out but foreign nationals have to participate in face scanning, <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/about/congressional-resources/testimony/statement-record-assessing-cbps-use-facial-recognition-technology">with some exceptions</a>.) Simply stand away from the camera or keep your face covered with a mask, present your ID, and say, “I opt out of biometrics. I want the standard verification process.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, an officer is then supposed to manually look over your ID and compare it to your face, as they used to do before facial recognition. But in practice, there have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/11/tsa-airport-security-facial-recognition/">reports of passengers —&nbsp;even a senator — facing resistance or intimidation</a> when they try to go this route.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) are also supposed to have clear signs informing passengers of the right to opt out. But at many airports, you have to look really, really hard to spot that message. Be prepared to crane your neck at an unnatural angle or squint at a very small font!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is why the Algorithmic Justice League, a nonprofit that sheds light on AI harms, launched a campaign this month called <a href="https://www.ajl.org/campaigns/fly">“Freedom Flyers”</a> to raise awareness of your right to opt out. The timing is perfect: The TSA <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/transportation/4738416-transportation-security-administration-record-air-travel-day/">recorded</a> an all-time record day for air travel on June 23, with nearly 3 million people screened at the country’s airports as summer vacation season picked up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now is the ideal time to make sure you know your rights when you pass through airport security —&nbsp;and understand exactly what’s at stake. The implications go way beyond air travel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How facial recognition works at the airport</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the US, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/facial-recognition-tsa-airport-security-privacy-7b97462591c49184d1cb19cda9c95211">over 80 airports</a> are currently piloting facial recognition technology. The TSA’s goal is to roll out the tech in all of the more than 430 airports that it covers, <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_biometrics_roadmap.pdf">arguing</a> that this kind of automation would reduce “friction” at airports —&nbsp;meaning, presumably, how long it takes passengers to move through security.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That should raise some eyebrows, because there are known risks with this AI technology, from the possibility that your face data will be <a href="https://www.oversight.gov/report/dhs/review-cbps-major-cybersecurity-incident-during-2019-biometric-pilot">stolen due to breaches</a> to the chance that you’ll be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html">misidentified as a criminal suspect — and jailed</a>. Neither of these are hypothetical scenarios; the former has happened due to CBP system vulnerabilities and the latter has happened at the hands of police. And then, of course, there’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22916602/ai-bias-fairness-tradeoffs-artificial-intelligence">AI bias</a>; facial recognition tech is known to disproportionately <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender">misidentify people of color</a>. (A CBP spokesperson insisted that the agency’s facial comparison algorithm “shows virtually no measurable differential performance in results based on demographic factors.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as dangerous as face recognition can be if it goes wrong, a greater concern could be what happens if it’s seen to work as intended. When I asked <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23365558/future-perfect-50-ai-joy-buolamwini-founder-algorithmic-justice-league">Joy Buolamwini</a>, the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, what worries her about the use of this tech in airports, she said, “The big one for me is normalizing surveillance.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Buolamwini argued that airport face recognition is a way of acclimating the public to having more and more sensitive information taken. “I see this on a longer trajectory,” she said. “And they’ve shown you the trajectory.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She was referring to <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/tsa_biometrics_roadmap.pdf">a roadmap released in 2018 by the TSA</a>. It distinguishes between two types of facial recognition: There’s one-to-one matching, where the TSA compares the photo in your passport with the photo they take of you at the airport, to make sure that the photos match. (If you ever use your face to unlock your iPhone, this is the kind of facial recognition you’re using.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s one-to-many matching, where your image is compared with images of others. One-to-many matching is already in use by CBP and airline partners in that they compare a passenger’s photo to a database of government documents (like US passports) for verification, TSA press secretary Carter Langston told me by email.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A particularly worrisome form of one-to-many matching is live biometrics. “Live biometrics is the <em>Minority Report</em> kind of thing —&nbsp;where you’re just walking around and they can identify you,” Buolamwini said. And if everyone’s face becomes fair game for live biometrics, your likeness could one day be checked against a criminal database any time you walk through a drug store or show up at a protest, which may <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/5/16/18625137/ai-facial-recognition-ban-san-francisco-surveillance">create a dangerous chilling effect</a> across society.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The TSA’s own 2018 roadmap says they aim to use “live biometrics” in the future. However, Langston disputed Buolamwini’s interpretation of that term. “That interpretation of TSA’s use case is nothing that I have heard anyone involved in the program indicate. TSA’s use case is and continues to be about identity verification,” he told me.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, Buolamwini said, “You might hear people say ‘Oh, we’re only doing one-to-one matching. You show us your ID, you show us your face, and we delete the data.’” But, she stressed, the full story is more complicated.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do airports really delete your photo after taking it?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first thing to know is that if you’re not a US citizen, you have no guarantee that your photo will be deleted.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/assets/documents/2022-Sep/CPE%20Final%20Report%20Traveler%20Verification%20Service%2020220815%20Final_%20Redacted_0.pdf">according to CBP documents</a>, “Facial images for in-scope [noncitizen] travelers are also transmitted to the Department’s Automated Biometric Identification System (IDENT) and Homeland Advanced Recognition Technology System (HART). All biometrics of in-scope travelers are transmitted to IDENT/HART as encounters and are retained for 75 years in support of immigration, border management, and law enforcement activities.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means your photo could end up in the database for the rest of your life. What’s more, CBP <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp056-tvs-february2021.pdf">notes</a> that “CBP may share information with federal, state, and local authorities, which may be authorized to use the information for purposes beyond the scope of CBP’s mission.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re a US citizen, you might breathe a bit easier upon reading on the CBP <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/biometrics/biometric-privacy-policy">website</a>, “CBP retains U.S. citizen photos for no more than 12 hours after identity verification, and only for continuity of operations purposes.” But even so, Buolamwini says, there’s reason to wonder whether all your data is really deleted after those 12 hours.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you submit to facial recognition, the tech analyzes a photo of your face and creates what’s called a “face print” or “face template.” This is not an image —&nbsp;it comes in the form of a series of numbers. You can think of it as your face’s metadata.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem is, even if airports do delete your photo, that does not necessarily mean they’re deleting your face print. And that face print is the real informational gold. Researchers have shown that <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8338413">they can reconstruct an image of your actual face</a> as long as they’ve got the face print.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I asked CBP what happens to that precious series of numbers. A CBP spokesperson did not answer the question about whether face prints get deleted in time for publication. After we published this story, the CBP spokesperson said that “CBP does not store or share the templates generated during the matching process, for either US citizens or non-citizens.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you’ve already let airports scan your face, is there a point in saying no next time?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe you’re in the same situation as me. Maybe you’ve already let airports scan your face. And maybe you’re wondering whether saying no in the future will make any difference, given that your face data is probably already in a database —&nbsp;or two —&nbsp;or three. (Separate from TSA, your individual airline may also scan your face instead of your boarding pass before letting you on the plane, though airlines <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/opinions/you-can-say-no-to-face-scans-for-airplane-boarding">say</a> you can opt out for domestic flights.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Buolamwini’s opinion? It’s definitely still worth declining the face scan next time you fly. “Every opt-out opportunity is a way to vote for your biometric rights,” she said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve already seen that when there’s enough of a public outcry, it can lead to deletion of face data. After Facebook’s facial recognition system sparked a class-action lawsuit, government investigations, and public furor, the company ended up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/02/technology/facebook-facial-recognition.html">deleting the face prints of more than a billion users</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Face purges can and do happen,” Buolamwini said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Remember, the TSA’s stated reason for rolling out facial recognition in airports is to minimize friction. If you’re unhappy about the use of the tech, you can consider generating more friction next time you fly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Airlines, banks, and retailers across the globe were among the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=ap+crowdstrike&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">many businesses that ground to a halt</a> on Friday due to a flawed software update that led to massive delays and service disruptions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to CrowdStrike, the Texas-based cybersecurity firm behind the glitch, the issue was caused by a faulty update in its software for Microsoft Windows users, a problem it’s actively working to address. Mac and Linux users were not affected.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is not a security incident or cyberattack,” CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz <a href="https://x.com/George_Kurtz/status/1814235001745027317">emphasized in a post on X</a>, formerly known as Twitter. Kurtz added that the fix for the problem had already been “deployed,” but noted in a <a href="https://consent.yahoo.com/v2/collectConsent?sessionId=2_cc-session_d1c9164c-8b8a-4425-9bee-8dcf6b8e8014">CNBC interview</a> that it could take “some time” before it goes into effect for everyone experiencing the outage.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While people await a fix, thousands across the world are grappling with long waits at airports and trains, issues logging into their bank accounts, and challenges reaching key services, including first responders.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tech error spotlights how central these systems have become to key day-to-day activities, including travel and financial transactions, and how vulnerable they can be to simple human mistakes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What happened?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Early Friday morning, businesses from Europe to Asia to the US began experiencing problems with their Microsoft computer systems, with many suddenly seeing the dreaded “blue screen of death”: an error page that signals that a Windows machine is inoperable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since then, a wide range of services have been affected in what was described by Troy Hunt, a cybersecurity expert, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/19/latest-live-updates-on-a-major-it-outage-spreading-worldwide.html">as the “largest IT outage in history.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://abc7ny.com/post/nyc-flight-delays-more-1000-canceled-us-amid/15071367/">More than 2,000 flights have been canceled</a> in numerous airports. American Airlines, Delta, and United were just a few of the major operators forced to ground their flights globally <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2024/07/19/global-it-outage-flights-canceled-delayed/74466125007/">for part of Friday</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A staggering graphic from Colin McCarthy, an atmospheric science student at UC Davis, captures how flight traffic slowed considerably in the wake of the tech snafu. Passengers at numerous airports <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2024/07/19/global-it-outage-flights-canceled-delayed/74466125007/">documented the chaos</a> while computers were down, and little information was available about updates or alternatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond the travel hiccups it caused, the software problem has led to hospitals <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/mass-general-brigham-warns-of-major-digital-incident-affecting-hospitals/61643836">canceling elective surgeries</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/business/emergency-911-calls-tech-outage.html">911 operators experiencing glitches</a>, and <a href="https://mashable.com/article/banks-affected-microsoft-outage-crowdstrike">banks unable to provide customer information online</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How did this happen?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem was caused by “a defect found in a single content update of its software on Microsoft Windows operating systems,” Kurtz wrote on X. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201717/windows-bsod-crowdstrike-outage-issue">The Verge notes</a>, it appears the company was trying to update a driver in its Falcon offering, which is a cloud-based product that scans for potential hackers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Falcon requires deep access to a computer’s system in order to operate effectively, meaning any glitches it experiences can have serious consequences, like the one that took place this week.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is CrowdStrike?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">CrowdStrike is an Austin, Texas-based cybersecurity firm that produces software to identify and stymie hacking threats. Its products are utilized by roughly 29,000 companies worldwide including hospitals, banks, and numerous Fortune 500 companies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It has previously helped look into breaches at Sony as well as the Democratic National Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How did CrowdStrike become so important?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Founded in 2011, CrowdStrike quickly became an industry leader in cybersecurity and has only grown in popularity in recent years as demand for such services has increased.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It has made an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2024/02/08/tackling-cyber-threats-the-genius-behind-crowdstrikes-super-bowl-ad/">aggressive marketing push</a> that included Super Bowl ads and has worked to tailor its products to the needs of large organizations with complex security. At least <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231108029764/en/CrowdStrike-Emerges-as-a-Leader-in-Cybersecurity-Channel-Sales-Growth-According-to-Independent-Channel-Analyst-Firm-Canalys">one 2023 analysis</a>, <a href="https://www.canalys.com/resources/worldwide-cybersecurity-channel-opportunity-q2-2023">from Canalys</a>, found the company controls roughly 20 percent of the cybersecurity market.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/endpoint-protection-platforms/vendor/crowdstrike/product/crowdstrike-falcon">Reviews for the company’s products</a> were broadly positive in the past, describing them as user-friendly and accurate in finding threats. <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/06/28/3-incredible-stats-that-suggest-crowdstrike-could/#:~:text=CrowdStrike's%20stock%20has%20soared%20by,in%20demand%20for%20its%20services.">According to the Motley Fool,</a> its stock surged 400 percent in the last five years.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>When will the outage be fixed?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kurtz, CrowdStrike’s CEO, has stressed that the team has identified the issue and is working to solve it, though it could take more time for some systems to recover.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company has already worked to pull back the update, he noted, meaning certain organizations might be able to address the problem by simply rebooting their systems. For others that have been unable to fix the issue in this way, “it could be hours, it could be a bit longer,” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/07/19/crowdstrike-ceo-on-global-outage-mission-now-is-to-make-sure-every-customer-is-back-up-and-running.html">Kurtz told CNBC</a>. Some <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/19/global-tech-outage-crowdstrike-impact-airlines">cybersecurity experts have said</a> “a bit longer” could mean days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some systems could need a manual update, for instance, though Kurtz noted that the company is working to automate those solutions as much as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">California state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco) is generally known for <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/8/21/23831121/housing-yimbys-affordable-rent-unions-california">his</a> relentless <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/19/17135678/sb-827-cars-california-transit-trains-buses">bills</a> on <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/12/7/18125644/scott-wiener-sb-50-california-housing">housing</a> and <a href="https://www.sf.gov/news/mayor-breed-and-senator-wiener-announce-state-legislation-shut-down-sale-stolen-goods-san">public safety</a>, a legislative record that made him one of the tech industry’s favorite legislators. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But his introduction of the “Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Models” bill, <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240sb1047">also known as SB 1047</a>, which requires companies training “frontier models” that cost more than $100 million to do safety testing and be able to shut off their models in the event of a safety incident, has inspired fury from that same industry, with VC heavyweights Andreessen-Horowitz and Y Combinator <a href="https://www.transformernews.ai/p/a16z-y-combinator-big-tech-sb1047-lobbying">publicly condemning</a> the bill.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I spoke with Wiener this week about SB 1047 and its critics; our conversation is below (condensed for length and clarity).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Kelsey Piper: I wanted to present you with challenges to SB 1047 I’ve heard and give you a chance to answer them. I think one category of concern here is that the bill would prohibit using a model publicly, or making it available for public use, if it poses an unreasonable risk of critical harm. </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s an unreasonable risk? Who decides what’s reasonable?&nbsp; A lot of Silicon Valley is very regulator-skeptical, so they don’t trust that discretion will be used and not abused.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Sen. Scott Wiener: </strong>To me, SB 1047 is a light-touch bill in a lot of ways. It’s a serious bill, it’s a big bill. I think it’s an impactful bill, but it’s not hardcore. The bill doesn’t require a license. There are people including some CEOs who <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/should-ai-development-require-license-chatgpts-creator-thinks-so-experts-disagree">have said</a> there should be a licensure requirement. I rejected that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are people who think <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/7/24062374/ai-openai-anthropic-deepmind-legal-liability-gabriel-weil">there should be strict liability</a>. That’s the rule for most product liability. I rejected that.&nbsp;[AI companies] do not have to get permission from an agency to release the [model]. They have to do the safety testing they all say they are currently doing or intend to do. And if that safety testing reveals a significant risk — and we define those risks as being catastrophic — then you have to put mitigations in place. Not to eliminate the risk but to try to reduce it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are already legal standards today&nbsp;that if a developer releases a model and then that model ends up being used in a way that harms someone or something, you can be sued and it’ll probably be a negligence standard about whether you acted reasonably. It’s much, much broader than the liability that we create in the bill. In the bill, only the Attorney General can sue, whereas under tort law anybody can sue. Model developers are already subject to potential liability that’s much broader than this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Yes, I’ve seen some objections to the bill that seem to revolve around misunderstandings of tort law, like people <a href="https://x.com/AndrewYNg/status/1798753608974139779">saying</a>,&nbsp; “This would be like making the makers of engines liable for car accidents.”</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And they are. If someone crashes a car and there was something about the engine design that contributed to that collision, then the engine maker can be sued. It would have to be proven that they did something negligent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve talked to startup founders about it and VCs and folks from the large tech companies, and I’ve never heard a rebuttal to the reality that liability exists today and the liability that exists today is profoundly broader.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We definitely hear contradictions. Some people who were <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355212/ai-artificial-intelligence-1047-bill-safety-liability">opposing</a> it were saying “this is all science fiction, anyone focused on safety is part of a cult, it’s not real, the capabilities are so limited.” Of course that’s not true. These are powerful models with huge potential to make the world a better place. I’m really excited for AI. I’m not a doomer in any respect. And then they say, “We can’t possibly be liable if these catastrophes happen.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1e0ts13/the_perils_of_californias_sb_1047_a_threat_to/">Another challenge</a> to the bill is that&nbsp;open source developers have benefited a lot from Meta putting [the generously licensed, sometimes called open source&nbsp;AI model] Llama out there, and they’re understandably scared that this bill will make Meta less willing to do releases in the future, out of a fear of liability. Of course, if a model is genuinely extremely dangerous, no one wants it released. But the worry is that the concerns might just make companies way too conservative.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In terms of open source, including and not limited to Llama, I’ve taken the critiques from the open source community really, really seriously. We interacted with people in the open source community and we made amendments in direct response to the open source community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The shutdown provision requirement [a provision in the bill that requires model developers to have the capability to enact a full shutdown of a covered model, to be able to “unplug it” if things go south] was very high on the list of what person after person was concerned about.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We made an amendment making it crystal clear that once the model is not in your possession, you are not responsible for being able to shut it down. Open source folks who open source a model are not responsible for being able to shut it down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then the other thing we did was make an amendment about folks who were fine-tuning. If you make more than minimal changes to the model, or significant changes to the model, then at some point it effectively becomes a new model and the original developer is no longer liable. And there are a few other smaller amendments but those are the big ones we made in direct response to the open source community.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Another challenge I’ve heard is: Why are you focusing on this and not all of California’s more pressing problems?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you work on any issue, you hear people say, “Don’t you have more important things to work on?” Yeah, I work <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/san-francisco-housing-approval-times-plummet-senator-scott-wieners-landmark-housing-law-takes">incessantly on housing</a>. I work on <a href="https://www.calbhbc.org/uploads/5/8/5/3/58536227/sb_855_-_fact_sheet_and_background_info.pdf">mental health and addiction treatment</a>. I work incessantly on <a href="https://abc7news.com/scott-wiener-speed-governors-pedestrian-safety-california-bills-streets-safer/14356386/">public safety</a>. I have an <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senate-passes-senator-wiener-bills-crack-down-car-break-ins">auto break-ins bill</a> and a <a href="https://www.sf.gov/news/mayor-breed-and-senator-wiener-announce-state-legislation-shut-down-sale-stolen-goods-san">bill on people selling stolen goods on the streets</a>.&nbsp;And I’m also working on a bill to make sure we both foster AI innovation and do it in a responsible way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a policymaker, I’ve been very pro-tech. I’m a supporter of our tech environment, which is often under attack. I’ve <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wieners-net-neutrality-law-upheld-federal-appeals-court">supported</a> California’s net neutrality law that fosters an open and free internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I have also seen with technology that we fail to get ahead of what are sometimes very obvious problems. We did that with data privacy. We finally got a data privacy law here in California — and for the record, the opposition to that said all of the same things, that it’ll destroy innovation, that no one will want to work here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My goal here is to create tons of space for innovation and at the same time promote responsible deployment and training and release of these models. This argument that this is going to squash innovation, that it’s going to push companies out of California — again, we hear that with pretty much every bill. But I think it’s important to understand this bill doesn&#8217;t just apply to people who develop their models in California, it applies to everyone who does business in California. So you can be in Miami, but unless you’re going to disconnect from California — and you’re not — you have to do this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I wanted to talk about one of the interesting elements of the debate over this bill, which is the fact it’s wildly popular everywhere except in Silicon Valley. It <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/bipartisan-vote-senate-passes-senator-wieners-landmark-ai-safety-and-innovation-bill">passed</a> the state senate 32-1, with bipartisan approval. <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/65ea6ad22e449b11a1df46b0/t/6694cb31c6758b310ba372f2/1721027377736/SB+1047+poll+memo.pdf">77 percent of Californians are in favor</a> according to one poll, more than half strongly in favor.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>But the people who hate it, they’re all in San Francisco. How did this end up being your bill?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some ways I’m the best author for this bill, representing San Francisco, because I’m surrounded and immersed in AI. The origin story of this bill was that I started talking with a bunch of front-line AI technologists, startup founders. This was early 2023, and I started having a series of salons and dinners with AI folks. And some of these ideas started forming. So in a way I’m the best author for it because I have access to unbelievably brilliant folks in tech. In another way I’m the worst author because I have folks in San Francisco who are not happy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s something I struggle with as a reporter, which is conveying to people who aren’t in San Francisco, who aren’t in those conversations, that AI is something really, really big, really high stakes.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s very exciting. Because when you start trying to envision — could we have a cure for cancer? Could we have highly effective treatments for a broad range of viruses? Could we have breakthroughs in clean energy that no one ever envisioned? So many exciting possibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But with every powerful technology comes risk. [This bill] is not about eliminating risk. Life is about risk. But how do we make sure that&nbsp;at least our eyes are wide open? That we understand that risk and that if there’s a way to reduce risk, we take it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s all we’re asking with this bill, and I think the vast majority of people will support that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats are increasingly panicked about Joe Biden’s 2024 chances after Thursday’s debate. But what will that panic result in?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The party is in uncharted territory. Doubts about Biden’s ability to defeat Trump have grown and speculation about whether he could be convinced to drop out of the race is mounting. Calls for Biden to quit are suddenly <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">widespread</a> in the media, even <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/joe-biden-tom-friedman.html">among</a> <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/honor-demands-joe-biden-step-aside">commentators</a> who had previously defended the president. Top Democrats are reportedly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/28/politics/biden-trump-presidential-debate-analysis/index.html">having similar discussions</a> behind the scenes, but the extent and seriousness of those discussions is not yet clear.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First off: Don’t expect anything to happen immediately. No one can outright force the president of the United States to quit the race, and he would not do so on a whim. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, Biden’s aides <a href="https://x.com/kaylatausche/status/1806675665845903645">are telling reporters</a> he has no plans to drop out. If top Democrats, Biden’s own most trusted advisers, and his family members urge him to reconsider, that could change. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that process would take some time — likely weeks, particularly given the complicated question of what would happen next.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, despite a great deal of uncertainty about what’s next, there appear to be three plausible options for where we’re headed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1) Biden sticks it out</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Often, when pundits are hyping a supposedly game-changing political moment, it’s useful to take a step back and skeptically ask: Will anything actually change?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden won every state in the Democratic primaries this year, and the <a href="https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P24/D-HS.phtml">overwhelming majority</a> of delegates are obligated to vote to nominate him at the convention by party rules. Those delegates are typically party loyalists trusted by the Biden team and state Democratic parties. They will not somehow revolt against him and depose him at the convention against his will.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t mean it’s certain that Biden will remain on the ticket. But basically, the only way he’s leaving the race is if he decides to do so himself — likely after being urged to do so by people he trusts and party bigwigs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new chorus of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/25/opinion/thepoint/krugman-biden-must-withdraw?smid=url-share">calls</a> from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/opinion">New York Times opinion writers</a> for Biden to drop out is an ominous development for him. Former Democratic aides who are now media commentators, like <a href="https://www.politico.com/video/2024/06/28/theres-still-time-van-jones-says-biden-should-be-replaced-1346384">Van Jones</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4745670-mccaskill-biden-debate-performance/">Claire McCaskill</a>, are saying similar things. But we have not yet seen similar public defections from currently serving elected Democrats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How intense will the pressure get? In part, that depends on the personal choices of Biden’s family members, his trusted advisers, and top Democrats, who will all have to decide whether they want to try and nudge him out or stand by him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their decisions will likely be shaped in part by post-debate polling. In the optimistic scenario for Biden, there’s little change and he can simply ignore his critics, grit his teeth, and weather the storm. But the worse the polling looks, the more panic will rise and the more isolated he’ll be.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2) Biden quits the race and endorses a successor </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Biden does decide to drop out, one way that could play out is that he’d endorse an intended successor at the same time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The obvious choice would be Vice President Kamala Harris. But the obvious problem with that obvious choice is that many Democrats think Harris has her own serious political weaknesses. That includes Biden himself, who <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2022/12/20/the-juicy-new-biden-book-00074849">reportedly called Harris</a> a “work in progress” early in his term. A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/18/politics/kamala-harris-biden-reelection-effort/index.html">report earlier this year</a> claimed Harris was still struggling to penetrate what she called the “bubble” of Biden campaign thinking.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Biden had clearly made Harris a trusted partner, helped prepare her for succession over the past several years, and viewed her as ready for prime time, a Biden-for-Harris swap would be an easier case to make. But none of that is really true.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Could Biden endorse someone else? In theory, he <em>could</em> pluck a Democratic governor somewhat at random — Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Gavin Newsom of California are often mentioned. He could then call on the party to unite behind that person, cross his fingers, and hope it happens. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in addition to infuriating Harris and her supporters (passing her over for a handpicked white nominee would be quite controversial), that decision would lack any democratic legitimacy. And if any faction in the party or wannabe candidate are sore enough, they could make their own play for delegates at the convention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In contrast, every Democrat who voted in the primaries knew they’d be getting VP Harris — and potentially President Harris, should Biden not make it through a second term. So if Biden does try to avert the possibility of convention chaos by anointing a successor, she’s by far the most rational choice.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3) Biden quits the race and there’s an open convention</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other option, if Biden chooses to drop out, is that he <em>doesn’t</em> try to pick a successor and simply says the party should figure it out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the obvious venue for such a discussion would be at the Democratic convention in late August.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent decades, the major parties’ national conventions have been coronations, in which the winner of the most delegates in the primaries gets the nomination. But in the days of yore, the conventions were where the nominee was actually decided — typically, in backroom deals among party power brokers who controlled the delegates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the convention was “open” again due to Biden’s withdrawal — freeing up the delegates to vote their conscience — the process would likely play out very differently in the modern media and social media environment. It would be far more public. (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-elaine-kamarck.html">Ezra Klein’s interview with Elaine Kamarck</a> has more specifics on how this could play out.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ideally, an open convention would be a fair venue for all the contenders in the party to make their respective cases, resulting in a fair vote (or multiple rounds of balloting), and eventually a nominee with majority support at the convention that the party can unite behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, this is more small-d democratic than Biden trying to pick a successor in advance. It lets thousands of delegates decide, rather than just the power players at the top who stood beside Biden for so long.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But one problem is that Democratic Party delegates don’t have very much democratic legitimacy themselves. They were not picked to pick a president — they were picked to rubber-stamp Biden’s nomination. And they don’t truly represent the public. The only real rationale for letting them pick the nominee is that it’s too late and logistically difficult to redo the nationwide primary process. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other risk is that an open convention devolves into a chaotic mess that divides and embitters the party rather than uniting it, and makes Democrats look awful to the public on national television.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The convention is less than two months away, so preparation for an actual open process would really need to begin soon if it’s going to happen. So all eyes will be on Joe Biden as he determines which path he will take.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no way to sugarcoat President Joe Biden’s debate performance on Thursday night: It was a disaster. He muttered, babbled, and failed to pounce on Donald Trump’s lies and threats to democracy. By Friday morning, the country’s liberal commentators were telling Biden to step down — and, behind closed doors, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/06/28/democrats-wake-up-to-a-nightmare-00165710?nname=playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b7bd0000&amp;nrid=0000015d-a357-df20-adff-b3ff37130000&amp;nlid=630318">many Democrats were saying the same thing</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid this gloom, I found a ray of hope from an unusual source: Astead Herndon, the New York Times reporter who has been <a href="https://x.com/AsteadWH/status/1755692285537271992">banging on about the political risks of Biden’s age for months</a> (and taking <a href="https://x.com/AsteadWH/status/1800975561688482180">a lot of Democratic fire</a> for doing so). After being proven spectacularly right on Thursday night, Herndon didn’t take a victory lap — he looked to the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t think the election is over. I think it’s just starting,” <a href="https://x.com/AsteadWH/status/1806533355766169673">he wrote on Twitter/X</a>. “We’re finally out of the [delusion] phase. Country and parties both.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Herndon’s comment stood out not just because it cut against the chorus of gnashing teeth, but because it pointed to <em>why</em> everything might not be doomed. If we truly were in a mass delusion about Biden’s ability to campaign, and now that’s ending, it opens up new possibilities for the 2024 election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And not just that. If the Democratic Party does prove capable of convincing Biden to step aside for a more inspiring candidate, it might even help address a deep concern about the future of the country itself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden as a symptom of national decline</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For months —&nbsp;maybe even years — American politics <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/americans-dismal-views-of-the-nations-politics/">has been mired in malaise</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are lots of reasons: Lingering <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cpi-report-inflation-economy-vibecession-cbs-explains/">anger about inflation</a>. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/24/us/politics/pandemic-politics-malaise.html">legacy of the pandemic</a>. Deep and <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/trust/archive/winter-2024/navigating-the-challenges-of-the-us-political-landscape">seemingly intractable polarization</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think a large part of it was the uninspiring prospect of a Trump and Biden rematch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Poll after poll showed that Americans were dissatisfied with the prospect of a 2020 rematch. Most of the country didn’t want this choice and still doesn’t. It’s conventional wisdom that “double haters” — voters who dislike both Biden and Trump — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/23/double-haters-biden-trump-deciders/">are the most decisive swing voters in the 2024 election</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We all know the reasons this dire matchup was going to happen. While Trump is unpopular with the public and the GOP elite, he has an unshakable grip on the Republican base. And though Biden is even less popular, no serious Democrat was going to risk torpedoing the party’s general election chances against Trump by launching a bitter primary challenge they’d almost certainly lose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the fact that things are this way is exactly the problem. When political parties offer people choices they hate, for whatever reason, people become (even more) disillusioned with their functioning. The “<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691248554/the-hollow-parties">hollow parties</a>,” as two political scientists recently described them, feel like just another symptom of America’s broader political brokenness.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden’s departure as a (possible) symbol of national renewal</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most plausible scenario is that Biden simply weathers the current PR storm and stays atop the ticket. If that happens without him doing <em>something</em> to prove the debate catastrophe was a one-off, it’ll simply reaffirm that the institutions designed to safeguard American democracy are as broken as everything else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have institutions to handle this. Biden could just step down. But we could also have an open convention. The party could nominate someone else. But the institutions are as moribund as the candidate: they have not seen use in many years,” <a href="https://www.unpopularfront.news/p/king-leer?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=112019&amp;post_id=146076182&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=7ttw&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">writer John Ganz</a> observed on Friday morning. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But at the same time, something feels <em>different</em> about the current wave of pressure on Biden to quit the race.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In February, after special counsel Robert Hur released a report suggesting that Biden had a poor memory, most liberals and Democrats <a href="https://www.vox.com/joe-biden/2024/2/23/24081128/joe-biden-age-mental-fitness-brokered-dnc-kamala-harris">insisted the president was being smeared</a>. After the debate, the liberal opinion-making world is in lockstep: Joe Must Go. And the quotes anonymous Democrats are giving to connected reporters are unprecedented.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think the president has one week to prove he is not dead,”’ a swing-state Congress member told <a href="https://x.com/mattyglesias/status/1806690977077239890">Slow Boring’s Matt Yglesias</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can imagine a scenario where this level of panic, combined with <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/jill-biden-must-step-up-now-to-help-oust-joe-biden">someone</a> from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/06/biden-trump-debate-2024/678826/">Biden’s inner circle</a> telling him the truth, might reach the president and convince him that his time is up. All of a sudden, the idea of Biden’s departure has left the realm of fantasy and entered the blurry world of uncertain probability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In such a scenario, the Democratic party could <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">avoid the chaos of a nasty primary or contested convention</a>; Biden could, in consultation with other party leaders, pick a successor and endorse them. The party would have months to rally behind <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/28/who-replace-biden-2024-election-democrats">whoever it was</a>: Vice President Kamala Harris, a Cabinet member like Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, or a popular and successful governor like Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer. For a party whose Washington leadership is dominated by boomers, its young bench is surprisingly deep.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This would do more than improve the Democratic party’s chances against Trump: It would show Americans that their institutions actually can do surprising, and maybe even impressive, things. It would provide concrete evidence that we aren’t stuck in a downward spiral of political sclerosis, that the unexpected can happen, and that sometimes it might actually be good.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I certainly don’t want to suggest that replacing Biden will fix everything, either for Democrats narrowly or for the country more broadly. In our polarized system, the election will remain close no matter what; the country’s problems run far deeper than the two old men running for president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s important not to let realism lapse into nihilism. Just because few things have changed American politics of late doesn’t mean nothing can. And we shouldn’t underestimate the importance of the person in the top job: The mere fact of Barack Obama’s identity <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Post-Racial-Most-Racial-Politics-Chicago-American/dp/022635301X">altered American politics at such a profound level</a> that we still haven’t fully grappled with the consequences.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s rare to see a clear pathway toward rebooting American politics. But Biden’s disastrous debate performance has created an opening for one. It’s up to him to take it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court has issued its <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-175_19m2.pdf">long-awaited ruling</a> in <em>Grants Pass v. Johnson</em>, the most significant legal challenge to the rights of homeless people in decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a 6-3 decision written by Justice Neil Gorsuch, the Supreme Court ruled that cities enforcing anti-camping bans, even if homeless people have no other place to go, does not violate the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Gorsuch was joined by the rest of the court’s conservatives, including Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Constitution’s Eighth Amendment serves many important functions, but it does not authorize federal judges to wrest those rights and responsibilities from the American people and in their place dictate this Nation’s homelessness policy,” the opinion read.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Friday’s ruling has huge implications for cities and people experiencing homelessness nationwide. It strikes a fatal blow to two Ninth Circuit decisions — the <em>Grants Pass v.</em> <em>Johnson </em>case and its <a href="https://www.vox.com/23748522/tent-encampments-martin-boise-homelessness-housing">2018 predecessor <em>Martin v. Boise</em></a><em> — </em>that have shaped cities’ responses to homeless encampments<em>. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leaders from dozens of cities and states — both liberal and conservative — have been hoping the US Supreme Court would overturn the <em>Martin </em>and <em>Grants Pass </em>decisions, which they claimed were incorrectly decided and left governments hamstrung and incapable of safely managing their communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many groups representing the rights of unhoused people, in turn, argued there was no reason for the US Supreme Court to reconsider the rulings, and warned that doing so will <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/24123323/grants-pass-scotus-supreme-court-homeless-tent-encampments">make it both easier to criminalize people</a> experiencing homelessness and much harder to land them permanent housing later on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to <em>Martin </em>in 2019, but pressure mounted on the high court as the nation’s homelessness crisis grew worse, especially in the Western states under the Ninth Circuit’s jurisdiction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over 650,000 people in America experience homelessness on any given night, and roughly <a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/hud-releases-2023-annual-homeless-assessment-report">40 percent</a> of those individuals are sleeping outside on the streets, in cars, parks, train stations, and other places not designed primarily for people. Federal <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2023-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html">data published in late 2023 showed</a> a rise in homelessness in most states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homelessness advocates immediately denounced the ruling, warning that it will make things worse and further marginalize vulnerable Americans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>Grants Pass </em>decision undoubtedly marks a significant setback to the constitutional rights of homeless people, and local governments will feel more confident passing punitive policies with the Supreme Court’s blessing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it will not end the political battles over tent encampments. It only concerns what cities <em>can </em>do, and not what they should do. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Conservatives want clearing homeless tent encampments to be non-discretionary</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those who want cities to be more aggressive in clearing homeless tent encampments are celebrating.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Theane Evangelis, the lead counsel for the city of Grants Pass, Oregon, praised the Court for “restor[ing] the ability of cities on the frontlines of this crisis to develop lasting solutions that meet the needs of the most vulnerable members of their communities, while also keeping our public spaces safe and clean.” She said she hopes that years from now this moment is recognized as “the turning point in America’s homelessness crisis.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even though overturning <em>Martin </em>and <em>Grants Pass </em>would <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/24123323/grants-pass-scotus-supreme-court-homeless-tent-encampments">make it easier</a> for cities to clear out tent encampments, local governments still hold considerable discretion over whether they <em>should </em>do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And especially in liberal cities, where leaders may be more inclined to leave people experiencing homelessness alone (or come under more pressure from advocates to do so), some conservatives have long felt additional legislative and legal action would be needed to actually force cities to act.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Many cities have used <em>Martin </em>as an excuse, you know, they throw up their hands and say, ‘Our hands are tied,’” said <a href="https://law.umn.edu/profiles/ilan-wurman">Ilan Wurman</a>, a law professor at the University of Minnesota who hoped the Supreme Court would overturn the decisions. “We don’t think that was a fair reading, that you can’t enforce your camping bans, and reversing <em>Grants Pass </em>would take that argument away [from cities]. But it still doesn’t require them to do anything at that point.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, Wurman and others <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/a-legal-strategy-for-tackling-homelessness">have been promoting</a> public nuisance lawsuits as a way to force cities to disband tent encampments. These types of lawsuits can be based on things like loud noise or air pollution, but also things like unsanitary conditions or other health hazards. Importantly, private citizens have the right of action to bring public nuisance claims.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first successful example of this strategy <a href="https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2022/09/16/phoenix-downtown-residents-businesses-file-lawsuit-homeless-camp/">was in 2022</a> against the city of Phoenix, Arizona, when Wurman and colleagues sued for a declaration that a downtown homeless encampment on city property constituted a public nuisance. More than 1,000 people had moved to this encampment — known as “the Zone” — and the plaintiffs pointed to the crime, defecation, drug use, theft, and other safety hazards there that threatened public health. Arizona <a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/az/title-36-public-health-and-safety/az-rev-st-sect-36-601.html">state law defines</a> “[a]ny place, condition or building that is controlled or operated by any governmental agency and that is not maintained in a sanitary condition” as a “public nuisance … dangerous to the public health.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A judge <a href="https://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/CV2022-010439-926-09202023.pdf">ruled in favor of the plaintiffs</a> last year, declaring “the Zone” a public nuisance, and ordered Phoenix to address the situation. The encampment is now cleared, but the city is appealing the decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wurman has had less success in his two other lawsuits pursuing the public nuisance strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last September, two Tucson homeowners and one Tucson business owner sued the city for failing to clear an encampment, citing things like trash, fire set by residents that burned uncontrollably, and car and residential theft.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like in Phoenix, the plaintiffs asked the courts to declare the campsite a public nuisance and order Tucson to clear it out. The city in turn argued the plaintiffs lacked standing and that they could not be liable for “fundamental government policy,” which includes how and whether to spend its public resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In May, a judge ruled in favor of the city and concluded the plaintiffs failed to show Tucson is “the legal cause of their alleged injuries.” The judge also drew contrasts between Tucson’s situation and the encampment in Phoenix, where Phoenix police actually helped transport unhoused people to be there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The residents are now appealing the case, and Wurman told me he believes they’ll win.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The judge in the Tucson case agreed with us that the city consented to the encampments but then he said the city didn’t consent to the feces or the drugs, and that’s what we lost on,” Wurman said. “We think that is quite frankly insane, right? Because everyone understands that encampments universally come with feces and drugs. Their own city witnesses testified that they’re always feces and urine and needles.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wurman saw another setback recently in his third public nuisance case, in Salt Lake City, Utah. The lawsuit, originally filed last September, was dismissed in March, with the judge defending the city’s right to use its discretion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;Any given member of the public might complain about how a city allocates its resources, and many such complaints could be articulated under the broad umbrella of nuisance law,” the judge wrote. “The <a href="https://mrsc.org/stay-informed/mrsc-insight/march-2023/understanding-the-public-duty-doctrine">public duty doctrine</a> places limits on when such complaints may be litigated in the courts as opposed to the ballot box.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wurman told me they’re appealing this case too, with a brief to the court due next month.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homelessness advocates think the nuisance legal strategy will ultimately fail because governments typically enjoy a lot of latitude in deciding where to put their resources and what laws to enforce. When the district attorney of Sacramento filed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/19/us/sacramento-homeless-lawsuit.html">public nuisance lawsuit</a> last year alleging the city had let its encampments get out of control, a district judge ruled that most of the DA’s allegations were legally insufficient.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Phoenix lawsuit is an outlier,” Will Knight, the decriminalization director at the National Homelessness Law Center, told me. “I think they&#8217;re going to lose on appeal in Tucson and Salt Lake City, and they’re going to keep losing similar nuisance lawsuits.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.law.berkeley.edu/our-faculty/faculty-profiles/erwin-chemerinsky/">Erwin Chemerinsky</a>, dean of UC Berkeley’s law school, also told me he thinks there’s a “huge difference” between reversing a Ninth Circuit decision and courts requiring that cities must clear tent encampments or arrest homeless people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, advocates are intent on trying different strategies, including some legislative ones. The Cicero Institute, an Austin-based conservative think tank, has been pushing bills across the country to ban outdoor homeless camping, and to make cities liable if they fail to enforce those bans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Cicero-backed bill in Missouri that was signed into law in 2022 allows the state’s attorney general <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2022/06/29/new-missouri-law-makes-sleeping-on-state-land-a-crime-for-people-experiencing-homelessness/">to sue local governments</a> that don’t enforce their encampment bans. Earlier this year in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/03/21/florida-camping-ban-homeless-public-spaces/73048034007/">Florida Republicans passed a new anti-camping law</a> that allows not just the state attorney general but also local residents and businesses to sue local governments if they fail to enforce their bans. It takes effect this fall.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another strategy advocates hope to ultimately take nationwide is at the ballot box. This fall, in Arizona, voters will vote <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-04-24/homeless-encampments-arizona-california-ballot-november-election">on a first-of-its-kind ballot measure</a> that could allow property owners to sue for tax refunds if they can prove financial damages from homeless tent encampments. The right-leaning Goldwater Institute, a Phoenix-based think tank, drafted the measure and hopes other cities will follow suit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Today’s decision is the first step toward a sensible approach to the many problems of homelessness,” said Goldwater Institute vice president for legal affairs Timothy Sandefur on Friday in a statement. “By overturning that decision, the Supreme Court today enables local communities to find actual solutions for the people who are suffering—and who deserve better than to be forced by the Ninth Circuit&#8217;s fiat to live indefinitely in public parks and on sidewalks.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Homelessness advocates hope to galvanize the public around housing solutions</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homelessness advocates, taking a page from abortion rights groups after the overturn of <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>have been in discussions with lawmakers to move forward both state and federal legislation that would codify the <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Boise</em> decision.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, they hope to push legislation to counteract what the Supreme Court just ruled and ensure that homeless people can’t be punished for sleeping outside on public property if there are no adequate alternatives available.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They also criticized the decision: “This decision sets a dangerous precedent that will cause undue harm to people experiencing homelessness and give free rein to local officials who prefer pointless and expensive arrests and imprisonment, rather than real solutions,” said Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. “This ruling allows leaders to shift the burden to law enforcement. This tactic has consistently failed to reduce homelessness in the past, and it will assuredly fail to reduce homelessness in the future.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, liberal homelessness activists hope to use the <em>Grants Pass</em> attention to focus the national conversation on policy solutions they say will actually solve homelessness, including universal rental assistance, repairs to public housing, and funds for eviction prevention. Advocates plan to call for $365 billion in the next year to fund these initiatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following the ruling advocates sent out an email blast inviting people to email their elected officials for more funding for housing and to join the “<a href="https://housingnothandcuffs.org/join/">Housing Not Handcuffs</a>” advocacy campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We knew from Day 1 that the Supreme Court case wouldn’t end homelessness,” said Jesse Rabinowitz, the communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center. “Now, we must use this moment in time to ensure that Congress and the White House do their job by funding the housing needed to ensure that nobody experiences homelessness in the richest country in the world.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When writing about technology that is rapidly improving, there are two obvious failure modes. One failure mode looks like <a href="https://x.com/AukeHoekstra/status/1804475281836499178">this graph</a>, famously made by Auke Hoekstra <a href="https://maartensteinbuch.com/2017/06/12/photovoltaic-growth-reality-versus-projections-of-the-international-energy-agency/">in 2017</a> and updated every year, showing how the International Energy Agency has repeatedly underestimated future growth in solar power:</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/GQrIr33XMAA_Gex.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,26.52265180484,100,46.954696390319" alt="A chart showing a steep difference in predictions vs reality of solar installation growth." title="A chart showing a steep difference in predictions vs reality of solar installation growth." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Solar installations have grown about 25 percent annually, but for more than a decade, the IEA has underestimated them, often predicting that they’ll level off and become steady or even decrease going forward. This is no small error; vastly underestimating progress on solar capacity dramatically changes the picture for climate change mitigation and energy production.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You saw some examples of the same failure mode in the early days of Covid-19. It’s very easy to underestimate exponential growth, especially in its earliest stages. “Why should we be afraid of something that has not killed people here in this country?” one epidemiologist <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-01-31/flu-coronavirus">argued in the LA Times in late January of 2020</a>. The flu is “a much bigger threat,” wrote the Washington Post a day later, comparing how many people were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/time-for-a-reality-check-america-the-flu-is-a-much-bigger-threat-than-coronavirus-for-now/2020/01/31/46a15166-4444-11ea-b5fc-eefa848cde99_story.html">currently infected with the flu to how many people were currently infected with Covid-19</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I hardly need to point out that this analysis badly missed the point. Sure, in late January there were not very many people in the United States with Covid-19. The worry was that, because of how viruses work, that number was going to grow exponentially — and indeed it did.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;So that’s one failure mode: repeatedly ignoring an exponential and insisting it will level out any minute now, resulting in dramatically missing one of the most important technological developments of the century or in telling people not to worry about a pandemic that would shut down the whole world just a few weeks later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other failure mode, of course, is this one:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My 3-month-old son is now TWICE as big as when he was born. <br><br>He&#039;s on track to weigh 7.5 trillion pounds by age 10 <a href="https://t.co/S4v9gXLlrt">pic.twitter.com/S4v9gXLlrt</a></p>&mdash; Christian Keil (@pronounced_kyle) <a href="https://twitter.com/pronounced_kyle/status/1768852493092680036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some things, like Covid-19’s early spread or solar capacity growth to date, prove to be exponential curves and are best understood by thinking about their doubling time. But most phenomena aren’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of the time, like with an infant, you’re not looking at the early stages of exponential growth but just at … normal growth, which can’t be extrapolated too far without ridiculous (and inaccurate) results. And even if you are looking at an exponential curve, at some point it’ll level out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Covid-19, it was straightforward enough to guess that, at worst, it’d level out when the whole population was exposed (and in practice, it usually leveled out well short of that, as people changed their behavior in response to overwhelmed local hospitals and spiking illness rates). At what point will solar capacity level out? That’s hardly an easy question to answer, but the IEA seems to have done a spectacularly bad job of answering it; they would have been better off just drawing a straight trend line.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There is no substitute for hard work</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think about this a lot when it comes to AI, where I keep seeing people posting dueling variants of these two concepts. So far, <a href="https://openai.com/index/scaling-laws-for-neural-language-models/">making AI systems bigger has made them better</a> across a wide range of tasks, from coding to drawing. Microsoft and Google are betting that this trend will continue and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/04/25/microsoft-google-ai-investment-profit-facebook-meta/">are spending big money</a> on the next generation of frontier models. Many skeptics have asserted that, instead, the <a href="https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/breaking-news-scaling-will-never">benefits of scale will level off</a> — or are already doing so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The people who most strongly defend returns to scale argue that their critics are playing the IEA game — repeatedly predicting “this is going to level out any minute” while the trend lines just go up and up. Their critics tend to accuse them of resorting to dumb oversimplifications that current trends will continue, hardly more serious than “my baby will weigh 7.5 trillion pounds.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Who’s right? I’ve increasingly come to believe that there is no substitute for digging deep into the weeds when you’re considering these questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To anticipate that solar production would continue rising, we <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/essay/2024/06/20/solar-power-is-going-to-be-huge">needed to study</a> how we manufacture solar panels and understand the sources of the ongoing plummeting costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The way to predict how Covid-19 would go was to <a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/exponential-growth-what-it-is-why-it-matters-and-how-to-spot-it/">estimate how contagious the virus was</a> from the early available outbreak data and extrapolate the odds of successful worldwide containment from there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In neither case could you substitute broad thinking about trend lines — it all came down to facts on the ground. It’s not impossible to guess these things. But it’s impossible to be lazy and get these things right. The details matter; the superficial similarities are misleading.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For AI, the high-stakes question of whether building bigger models will rapidly produce AI systems that can do everything humans can do — or whether that’s a lot of hyped-up nonsense — can’t be answered by drawing trend lines. Nor can it be answered by mocking trend lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Frankly, we don’t even have good enough measurements of general reasoning capabilities to describe the increases in AI capabilities in terms of trend lines. Insiders at labs building the most advanced AI systems tend to say that, as they make the models bigger and more expensive, they see continuing, large improvements in what those models can do. If you’re not an insider at a lab, these claims can be hard to evaluate — and I certainly find it frustrating to sift through papers that tend to overhype their results, trying to find out which results are real and substantive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s no shortcut around doing that work. While there are questions we can answer from first principles, this isn’t one of them. I hope our enjoyment of batting charts back and forth doesn’t obscure how much serious work it takes to get these questions right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With that, let’s get into the books.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/books/alice-munro-dead.html">Alice Munro’s death</a> last month, I’ve been rereading <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-beggar-maid-stories-of-flo-and-rose-alice-munro/6723399?ean=9780679732716">The Beggar Maid</a></em>, her 1987 novel-in-stories, and thinking about what a perfect book it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The novel-in-stories form is maybe one of the most beautiful variations on the novel, and it’s a structure Munro innovated and mastered. It means a collection of short stories featuring the same characters which, when compiled into a single volume, become a long narrative about them. You might think here of Jennifer Egan’s <em>A Visit From the Goon Squad</em> or Sandra Cisneros’s <em>The House on Mango Street</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>The Beggar Maid</em> (published outside the US as <em>Who Do You Think You Are?</em>), the short stories are about Rose, a bright and awkward girl growing up in small-town Canada, and her stepmother Flo, who Rose both admires and is ashamed of. You follow Rose from her clumsy childhood up to her glamorous adulthood, watching the way her life is informed by the impoverished small town she’s left behind.&nbsp;Each story in the cycle stands on its own, discrete and shining like a pearl, and then Munro strings them all together into something new like beads on a necklace.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you haven’t read Munro before, <em>The Beggar Maid</em> is a good place to start. If you’d like something else to read, let’s see what we can do for you.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">On the shelf</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em><a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-virgin-in-the-garden-a-s-byatt/6712380?ean=9780679738299">The Virgin in the Garden</a></em> by A.S. Byatt</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While we’re on the subject of memorial readings! A few months ago, we also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/nov/17/as-byatt-dame-antonia-byatt-obituary">lost A.S. Byatt</a>, author of <em>Possession</em> and a longstanding favorite of mine. Byatt, who was also an English professor, wrote primarily bookish novels about academics. She had a deep sense of the pleasures of reading and analyzing a text, and she had an impeccable eye for writing about color. Byatt novels are always streaked with descriptions of peacock greens and deep rich crimsons and shadowy mauves, so that reading them feels like standing beneath a stained glass window.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Byatt’s best known for the Booker Prize-winning <em>Possession</em>, but the book of hers that’s been speaking to me most lately is her 1978 novel <em>The Virgin in the Garden</em>. It’s about a family of academics, all very clever and varying degrees of unhappy, who are roped into putting on a play about Queen Elizabeth I to celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The great joy of it for me is Fredericka, the youngest daughter of the family, bursting with bratty joy at her own erudite intelligence. There’s no one else in fiction quite like her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fyou-dreamed-of-empires-alvaro-enrigue%2F19997322%3Fean%3D9780593544792">You Dreamed of Empires</a></em> by Álvaro Enrigue, translated by Natasha Wimmer</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is an absolute wonder of a new novel from Álvaro Enrigue, an institution in Mexico but whose work only recently became available to English-language readers. (<em>You Dreamed of Empires</em> is Enrigue’s third book to be published in English.) It takes place over the course of a single day in 1519, when the Spanish conquistador Cortés arrives at the imperial palace of Moctezuma in what is now Mexico City.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cortés’s troops are ragged and unwashed, “provincials, nobodies, hicks,” who are fixated on “the juice of rotting fruit they bring from their own lands.” The Tenochtitláns (rendered Aztecs by the rude Spanish) are, in contrast, magnificently wealthy, at the seat of a massive empire, and lavished with such marvels as quilts, grasshopper tacos, and magic mushrooms. (Moctezuma spends a lot of his page time in this novel tripping.) We know how history ends — but in Enrigue’s playful, hallucinatory prose, it feels entirely possible for things to go in different directions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701643&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fp%2Fbooks%2Fthe-ministry-of-time-kaliane-bradley%2F20696241%3Fean%3D9781668045145">The Ministry of Time</a></em> by Kaliane Bradley</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The Ministry of Time</em> is an unbelievably satisfying read, one I could not put down. Published just last month, it takes place in a near-future London where the British government has developed the technology to time travel. To test it, they’ve extracted people out of historical death traps and into the present moment. Our unnamed narrator is a government bureaucrat hired to help one such time traveler adjust to the present as his live-in companion. Of course they fall in love, but there’s a lot more to it than that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The narrator references <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/03/22/graham-greenes-dark-heart">Graham Greene’s midcentury wartime spy novels a lot</a>, and that’s more or less the best comparison for this book. Think: smoke-filled rooms full of intrigue, hard-won camaraderie that is all the more precious for existing in so desperate a time, a protagonist who is never quite as innocent as she would like to believe herself. To that mix, Bradley adds time travel, romance, and a sophisticated exploration of the ways post-colonialism shapes our minds. I gobbled this book up in a matter of days. You will, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This Sunday, French voters will cast their ballots in the first round of the country’s parliamentary election — one that President Emmanuel Macron called as a surprise after the far-right National Rally (RN) <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/354601/european-parliament-elections-macron-afd-national-rally-far-right-fidesz-france">won big in the European parliamentary elections earlier this month</a>. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/france-elections-2024-polls-macron-le-pen">French polls</a> suggest that the RN will also win big on Sunday and in the second round of voting that follows a week later — gaining either a plurality of seats or perhaps even an outright majority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the final results may not be known for more than a week, the stakes are quite clear&nbsp;and quite high. In the French system, presidents depend on parliamentary majorities for major domestic policy-making; without a majority, Macron will be fairly impotent at home. If the RN has an outright majority, it can start passing parts of its far-right agenda, and Macron will have only limited tools to stop them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On one level, this isn’t surprising. The RN’s long-time leader, Marine Le Pen, has been Macron’s chief rival in the past two presidential elections. It’s clear that her party has emerged as the leading alternative to Macron’s centrism; few observers are surprised that his decision to call this parliamentary election early <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240627-french-far-right-dominates-polls-three-days-ahead-of-snap-elections">is likely to lead to RN gains</a>. A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/macron-approval-rating-falls-to-match-previous-low">deeply unpopular president</a> causing voters to turn to the opposition: In some ways this is just democracy as usual.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But on another level, the RN’s rise should be truly shocking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not so long ago, the party’s extremism made it anathema to nearly everyone in France. When Le Pen’s father and the party’s founder Jean-Marie made it to the second round of the presidential election in 2002, nearly the entire country <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/04/23/this-chart-shows-how-the-french-election-is-a-break-from-the-past/">rallied against him and his party</a> (then called the National Front, or FN). He lost in a landslide 82–18 defeat, the worst showing of any presidential candidate since 1958.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even after years of Marine Le Pen softening the RN’s image, its policy agenda remains nearly as radical as it was then. The RN’s signature policy is to enact a “national priority” law <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/25/france-far-right-national-rally-history-1972-marine-le-pen#:~:text=Marine%20Le%20Pen%20has%20kept,has%20renamed%20%E2%80%9Cnational%20priority%E2%80%9D.">formally discriminating against immigrants</a> in housing, hiring, and public benefits.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The real story of the 2024 election is not that voters are turning against Macron, but how the far right came to be seen as a palatable alternative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a rise fueled in large part by the RN’s canny political strategy, an extreme party doing a brilliant job of making itself seem reasonable to voters outside its base. But it’s also been fueled by the hubris and missteps of Macron, who seems motivated by a false sense that the RN was so toxic that he would inevitably triumph in a forced binary choice, just as his predecessor did in 2002.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These two forces have worked in tandem to turn the RN into the de facto leader of the opposition to an unpopular president. And now, France — like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94">other democracies around the world</a> — is reaping the whirlwind.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How France’s extreme right mainstreamed itself</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rise of the RN can best be understood as a kind of double normalization, with each generation of Le Pens playing a distinct but crucial role.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After World War II, the European far right appeared to be a spent force. No political movement could hope to win national elections promising a Third Reich redux; those that tried found no success.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">French politics immediately after the war —&nbsp;the Fourth Republic period — was tumultuous. After a military revolt in 1958, World War II hero Charles de Gaulle took power and ushered in a new constitution. The Fifth Republic remains the system under which France operates today. After De Gaulle left power in 1969, French elections evolved into relatively stable contests between center-right and center-left blocs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jean-Marie Le Pen was the first to develop a credible far-right alternative.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recognizing that the Nazis had rendered dictatorship and race hatred beyond the pale, Le Pen refocused the far right on contesting elections by attacking immigration. The argument wasn’t (primarily) that minorities were biologically inferior, just that France is under no obligation to admit culturally distinct foreigners and treat them as equals. After he founded the National Front for French Unity (FN) in 1972, the party adopted the slogan “France is for the French.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Le Pen paired this xenophobia with extreme nationalism. He was a veteran of France’s failed wars to keep colonies in Vietnam and Algeria; in one contemporary interview, he <a href="https://www.theafricareport.com/346813/le-pen-and-torture-in-algeria-individual-crime-or-historical-crime/">seemingly confessed to personally torturing Algerian detainees</a> (a charge he later denied). As a politician, Le Pen defended French imperialism and railed against its diminished glory in a post-colonial era. Immigration, for Le Pen, was a kind of “reverse colonization” in which France’s former subjects were destroying its identity from within.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because the FN was never an outright fascist party, it could put itself forward as something distinct from Europe’s discredited Hitlerite past. This “<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228468169_Reputational_shields_Why_most_anti-immigrant_parties_failed_in_Western_Europe_1980-2005">reputational shield</a>,” as scholars term it, helped it make inroads into French politics in ways that neo-Nazis never could. In 1984, just 12 years after its founding, the FN managed to win 11 percent of the national vote in a European Parliament election. It soon became a model for far-right parties across the continent, which <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010414003251176">rapidly began outperforming neo-Nazi rivals.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonetheless, the FN had a clear ceiling,&nbsp;and Le Pen himself was a big part of the problem. The party’s founder has always had a habit of rhetorical bomb-throwing that kept it from making further inroads with the broader public.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He has repeatedly engaged in Nazi apologia, calling the Holocaust a “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna29881495">detail</a>” of history and <a href="https://www.clevelandjewishnews.com/archives/latest-news-briefs-from-the-jewish-telegraphic-agency/article_546ad744-caba-5d66-8ade-587c7becc313.html">saying that </a>“in France, at least, the German occupation was not particularly inhuman.” In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/06/world/europe/07cnd-france.html">a 2006 interview</a>, he said that “you can’t dispute the inequality of the races” because “blacks are much better than whites at running, but whites are better at swimming.” In his 2018 memoir, he defended French citizens who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/world/europe/lepen-memoir-france-national-front.html">volunteered for the German SS during World War II</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I — like millions of other French people — grew up with the image of Le Pen as a snarling bigot with an underbite, a political bogeyman who tidily gathered up all the ugliness of France’s recent history,” journalist Nick Vinocur <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/marine-le-pen-turned-respectable-france-presidential-election/">writes in Politico</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Jean-Marie’s daughter Marine took over the FN in 2011, she was initially perceived in much the same way. But the younger Le Pen proved a cannier operator, not only realizing that her party needed an image makeover but successfully delivering on it.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-471796314.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="France&#039;s far-right political party Front National founder and honorary president Jean-Marie Le Pen gestures onstage as FN&#039;s president Marine Le Pen looks on, in Paris France, May 1, 2015. | Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of this was about language. As Vinocur reports, she shifted the party’s demagoguery away from direct attacks on Muslims and Arabs and toward dog-whistles about cultural change and terrorism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She would occasionally discipline party members who crossed her lines — including, most notably, her father. In 2015, when Jean-Marie once again got into trouble over comments about Jews and the Holocaust, Le Pen did the unthinkable: She expelled her father from the party he founded. He should “no longer be able to speak in the name of the National Front,” <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34009901">she said at the time</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2018, following a decisive presidential defeat, she changed the party’s name from National Front to National Rally. While seemingly minor, the move helped distance the party from her father’s relatively toxic brand and establish Le Pen’s independence as a political figure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the current election, she has tried to elevate candidates —&nbsp;most notably, 28-year-old party leader and proposed prime minister Jordan Bardella — who come across as normal, suit-wearing politicians rather than bombastic confessed torturers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t be fooled. Experts on French politics say that Le Pen’s moderation is primarily symbolic. While she has sanded off the RN’s rough edges, she also has maintained the far-right policy core —&nbsp;most notably, the “national priority” system mandating discrimination against immigrants in public goods —&nbsp;that helped make her father’s party so toxic in the first place. During the current campaign, Bardella vowed to <a href="https://www.thelocal.fr/20240614/explained-what-is-le-pens-party-policy-on-dual-nationals-in-france">ban dual nationals from holding government jobs</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“From [a policy lens], there’s very little difference between what Marine Le Pen is running with and what Jean-Marie was defending,” says Marta Lorimer, a Cardiff University expert on French politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Together, in short, the Le Pens accomplished one of the most successful political rebrandings in modern history. They created a party rooted in thinly veiled bigotry and, without significant policy compromise, turned it into something that the median French voter might actually consider supporting.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Macron’s (implicit) deal with the devil</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The RN’s recent success is not merely a story of Marine Le Pen’s political skills. Like most European far-right parties, it benefited hugely from the 2015 refugee crisis, which turned its signature issue of immigration <a href="https://migrant-integration.ec.europa.eu/library-document/what-do-people-europe-think-about-migrants-special-eurobarometer-survey_en">into <em>the</em> issue across the continent</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Le Pen also benefited from the rise of Emmanuel Macron, a self-proclaimed “radical centrist” who shattered the foundations of France’s party system. In doing so, he created the perfect conditions for Le Pen’s rebranding to succeed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The traditionally dominant factions of the center right and center left, today called the Republican and Socialist parties, saw themselves as rivals with a shared responsibility: guarding the republic from extremist forces that would harm it. They agreed never to share power with the FN/RN, an agreement referred to as “the republican front” or “cordon sanitaire.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Macron broke the two-party system. In 2016, he quit his position as finance minister under a Socialist president to run for president at <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/5/8/15578338/french-election-2017-macron-le-pen-results">the head of a party he just founded</a>, now called Renaissance. At the time, this may have seemed like an act of extreme hubris. But Macron proved far more popular than either of his mainstream rivals, and he won the most voters in the first round of France’s 2017 election. He faced Marine Le Pen in the head-to-head second round and crushed her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After winning power, Macron made two moves that would serve his short-term political interests but end up paving the way for the RN’s rise in the long run.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, Macron built his new party as a kind of centrist empire, one designed to occupy the entirety of the territory between radical right and extreme left. Containing both former Socialists and Republicans, its rise sapped the vitality from the already-weakened established parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their decline should, in theory, have left Macron and Renaissance the only serious choice for most French voters. Certainly that was Macron’s theory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No politician, even one as “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-jupiter-model-unlikely-to-stand-test-of-time-leadership-parliamentary-majority/">Jupiterian</a>” as Macron, can maintain a personal majority forever. Macron has become deeply unpopular, with a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-21/macron-approval-rating-falls-to-match-previous-low?embedded-checkout=true">mere 26 percent of French voters</a> approving of his current performance. It’s easy to blame specific policies, like his <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-65279818">pension reform</a> and <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/20181205-france-macron-abandons-fuel-tax-hike-fears-violence-new-yellow-vest-protests">failed gas tax</a>, but it also might be plain old exhaustion. Around the world, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/06/world-elections-anti-incumbent-leaders-backlash">incumbents are unpopular</a>,&nbsp;and Macron has been in office for seven years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So if French voters want to vote against Macron, who should they turn to? The center right is a shadow of itself. The center left has been forced into an unwieldy “new popular front” <a href="https://time.com/6991254/macron-bardella-le-pen-far-right-left-election/">alliance with the polarizing and unstable extreme left</a>, led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon. There’s a smaller extreme-right party, led by comedian Eric Zemmour, but he’s even more radical than Le Pen.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That leaves only one non-Macron option with a proven electoral track record: the RN.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s only two options for voters,” says Florence Faucher, a professor of political science at France’s Sciences Po research center. “At some point, people are going to want change from the majority of Macron.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Macron didn’t just demolish the other centrist parties. He actually aided Le Pen’s strategy of normalizing her party by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-67778170">tacking to the right on immigration</a>. “It’s not so much that the National Rally has moderated [on immigration] than that the entire political system has radicalized,” says Lorimer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Macron has, for example, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/2/macron-announces-new-plan-to-regulate-islam-in-france">said</a> that “Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world” and <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-emmanuel-macron-abaya-muslim-dress-ban-schools-secularism/">banned</a> some traditional Muslim clothing in schools. (Roughly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jun/21/france-snap-parliamentary-elections-muslims-lyon-far-right-national-rally">6 million people in France</a> practice Islam or come from a Muslim background.) Last year, he had Parliament pass an immigration bill so draconian that Le Pen hailed it as “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/france-marine-le-pen-scores-big-win-on-toughened-immigration-bill-macron/">an ideological victory</a>” for her party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She was more correct than it seems. Some <a href="https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/207180/1/ZORA207180.pdf">research on European politics</a> suggests that when parties in the center take right-wing positions, they don’t actually win over that party’s supporters. Instead, they end up normalizing far-right discourse on the topic: helping people on the fence think it must not be so weird to rail against Islam if self-proclaimed centrists are doing it and that maybe they can consider voting for the far right without being a bad person.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That appears to be how Macron’s strategy has worked out in France. His attempt to take out Le Pen’s signature issue has only made her seem more reasonable, all without persuading her base to defect to the center.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“All the attempts to co-opt the far right have aided the process of normalization,” says Art Goldhammer, an expert on France at Harvard University’s Center for European Studies. “The slogan in France is that people prefer the original to the copy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t Macron’s intent to usher in an RN-led Parliament. His actions betray a belief that the RN would always have a ceiling; that, when push comes to shove, the French people would always choose his moderation over Le Pen’s extremism when presented with a binary choice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This strategy has long worked in modern France, but Macron appears to have finally found its limits. The same arrogance that powered Macron’s 2017 presidential bid has now brought France to the brink of a Parliament dominated by radicals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For more than 400 million years, horseshoe crabs — 10-eyed, blue-blooded, dome-shaped sea creatures — have lived on our planet, crawling ashore in spring and summer to mate and lay thousands of eggs that look a bit like grains of millet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They were doing this before Pangea broke up into the continents we know today. They were doing this the year an Everest-sized, dinosaur-slaying asteroid smashed into what is now Mexico.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And they continued doing this as humans transformed the planet, replacing forests with farms, covering beaches with buildings, and flooding the air and water with pollution. Even on some of the most urban stretches of coastline, in North America and Asia, these creatures still appear each year to seed the next generation.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Horseshoe_Spot.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.141532949541,100,39.716934100918" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">One evening during a heat wave in June, I drove to Plumb Beach in south Brooklyn with a couple of friends. It’s a beautiful spot. The water is calm and the sand is speckled with shells and tufts of tall grass. It’s also very much a city beach. Plastic takeout containers poke out of the sand. There’s a large tire in the shallows. Traffic on the Belt Parkway competes with the sound of waves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonetheless, in May and June, horseshoe crabs appear here, like magic, around full and new moons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The females, which are noticeably larger than the males, release pheromones on their way into shore to draw in suitors. One lucky male will grab onto her rear, using a pair of specialized claws, and release sperm while she lays eggs in the sand. Other “satellite” males will follow the pair around and try —&nbsp;often with successful results —&nbsp;to get their sperm in the mix too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This ancient animal orgy was on full display that evening.&nbsp;Just before sunset, dozens of the crabs — which are not technically crabs but arthropods more closely related to spiders — started coming to shore. Most of them paired up. Every few meters I saw a female the size of a dinner plate dragging along a salad-plate-size male. Some crabs were in piles. Others were in conga lines: rows of five or more individuals all attached to each other.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The horseshoe crabs were coated in a colorful amalgam of other sea creatures —&nbsp;barnacles, mussels, snails, and even crustaceans — as if they each had their own style. Sometimes called walking hotels, these animals are a foundation for so much life. They are ecosystems unto themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0287.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />

<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0656-2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not all they support. The many eggs that horseshoe crabs lay on the beach — which can number in the tens of thousands per female — are food for more than 20 species of migratory birds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None, perhaps, rely on them more than red knots. Rotund sandpipers that sport rust-colored chests in the summer, they&#8217;re among the world’s most impressive travelers. In the eastern hemisphere, some red knots migrate more than 9,000 miles, from the tip of South America to the Arctic Circle. And they rely on horseshoe crab eggs to fuel this trip. In the spring, red knots time their journey north to align with spawning on the East Coast (and especially the Delaware Bay).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Red knots will use Plumb Beach to refuel, though I saw a different crew of egg-eaters that evening: laughing gulls, which are basically elevated seagulls. While they too are&nbsp;seagulls — a&nbsp;colloquial&nbsp;term&nbsp;that people tend to use for&nbsp;all gull species found near the sea — they have black heads and calls that sound like cackles. I watched dozens of them travel in a pack down the beach, feasting on eggs and laughing.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0525.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A flock of laughing gulls fly over Plumb Beach." title="A flock of laughing gulls fly over Plumb Beach." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Horseshoe crabs also support billions of human lives. Their blood, made blue by copper-based proteins that transport oxygen, is a medical marvel. It quickly clots in the presence of bacterial toxins, and that has made it invaluable for sterility testing. Scientists use horseshoe crab blood to make sure medical devices, intravenous drugs, and vaccines — including those for Covid-19 — are free of harmful bacteria and safe to use.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I find this all pretty remarkable: These animals, which are basically walking helmets, have been supporting life around them for hundreds of millions of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0534.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Horseshoe crab eggs." title="Horseshoe crab eggs." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s us.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an imperceivable fraction of the horseshoe crab timeline, humans have torn countless lives apart. We’ve ripped up forests and grasslands and overfished the seas, and we’re now slowly cooking the planet with carbon dioxide. Humans are fracturing the support beams of ecosystems.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re even challenging the resilience of horseshoe crabs. In the last few decades,&nbsp;and especially in the 1990s,&nbsp;millions of these crabs were harvested and drained of blood. They often died afterwards. Fishermen also capture horseshoe crabs and use them as bait for eels and conch. Overharvesting caused their population —&nbsp;and the populations of some birds that depend on them —&nbsp;to crash. Red knots are federally threatened under the US Endangered Species Act, largely due to a decline in horseshoe crabs.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0342.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A few horseshoe crabs swimming with their tail spines pointing out of the water." title="A few horseshoe crabs swimming with their tail spines pointing out of the water." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" /><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/331A0359.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A dead horseshoe crab upside down on the beach next to the top of a plastic container." title="A dead horseshoe crab upside down on the beach next to the top of a plastic container." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Benji Jones/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Benji Jones/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">When you glimpse these creatures on the beach, they don’t appear especially intelligent or skillful. Males will confuse other males for mates. Sometimes they even pair up with rocks. I also saw a number of them stuck upside down, like capsized June bugs, their legs moving in the air with an almost mechanical rhythm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then again, these animals have outlived almost every other organism on Earth. They’re obviously doing something right. More profoundly, they’ve helped sustain life around them. I might even suggest that we should all aspire to be more like horseshoe crabs. We should look up to these sea spiders, and try fortifying ecosystems rather than destroying them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So many important issues are at stake in the 2024 election: <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-trump-on-key-foreign-policy-issues-/7561392.html">foreign policy</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court">reproductive rights</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356761/bidens-border-record-trumps-claims-vs-reality">immigration</a>, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24159069/trump-guardrails-authoritarian-democracy-second-term">future of American democracy</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But coming out of the first debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, one topic has crowded all those out: Biden’s performance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s rationale for agreeing to this historically early presidential debate was, in part, to try and put concerns over his age to rest. Instead, they’ve been supercharged. Multiple reports soon after the debate claimed that top Democrats were downright panicked by how Biden came off onstage. Major media outlets wrote that Biden “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/06/27/presidential-debate-live-updates/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f001">struggled</a>” and appeared “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/06/27/us/biden-trump-debate">shaky</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden is the oldest president ever, and Republicans have long been trying to push an exaggerated narrative that he is senile. He didn’t seem senile on stage — but he didn’t seem sharp, either. He spoke very softly, his answers were often messy on the substance, and when he did have decent lines they were usually hampered by his halting and understated delivery.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sources told NBC News midway through the debate that Biden <a href="https://x.com/kellyo/status/1806505436457189594?s=46">has a cold</a>, implying his affect was a one-off fluke. The risk, though, is that voters determined after watching that he is simply not up for the job he wants to keep. This was, after all, the most prolonged look at Biden in an adversarial setting we’ve gotten in some time, and he didn’t come off well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s performance was no great shakes: He said absurd and untrue things, rambled and lost coherence. But he did it more energetically — and, more to the point, he was typical Trump, no one would be surprised by what he said or how he said it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On one level, all of the above is so shallow and superficial that I feel somewhat embarrassed to have written it. Politics should be about more than theater criticism and affect. It’s about important issues that will affect the lives of millions of people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, the question of what a relatively small group of swing voters thinks about Joe Biden’s age may well be what the 2024 election hinges on. Many Democrats think they have a winning argument against Trump on the issues, but they’re worried that Biden simply can’t make the case. So the most immediate consequence of Thursday’s debate will be a revival of chatter about <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">whether Biden should even stay</a> in the race or <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357739/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-nominee-whitmer-moore-newsom">whether there’s still some other option</a> for Democrats. And that consequence makes for a pretty clear set of takeaways for the race in the wake of this debate.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Loser: Joe Biden</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No need to belabor the point: If the debate ends with your party debating whether you should even stay in the race, it’s pretty obvious you lost.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden “age issue” is really a conflation of a few separate things. Again, there’s the exaggerated right-wing narrative that he’s senile. There are normal concerns about aging slowing people down somewhat mentally and physically. There’s the question about whether his health would hold up in a second term. There are questions about whether any of this has impaired his decision-making or governance (I don’t believe it has; it’s hard to point to an example of any administration decision that would be different if he was Joe Biden but younger).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s also a more difficult concern for Biden to rebut: that he has failed to appropriately “perform” the role of president or presidential candidate. That he hasn’t been good at seeming like he’s in command, like he’s energetic, can handle tough questioning, and is up to the job.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is where he failed most glaringly during the debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For many elite Democrats, the worry about Biden’s age is mainly a meta-worry: It’s about what swing voters will think about Biden’s age. If that’s your rubric, it doesn’t matter if you think he’s doing a great job as president; what matters is what the swing voters will think. And it’s hard to believe many liked what they saw on Thursday.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winner: Donald Trump</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By default, in a two-person contest, Trump won the debate due to Biden’s weakness. But his performance was not particularly impressive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As usual, Trump got sidetracked into his perennial grievances (“Russia Russia Russia,” “the laptop,” James Comey, false claims of 2020 election fraud). He lied, said ridiculous things, and dodged questions. He also missed opportunities: Biden was shaky enough that a more disciplined and savvy Republican candidate could well have embarrassed him far more — by, for instance,&nbsp;posing questions directly to him and truly throwing him off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump did benefit from the relative lack of focus on his attempt to steal the 2020 election and his recent criminal conviction. And perhaps the way he won most was that the debate seemed to normalize him: His attack on American democracy was just one issue among many, only showing up halfway through.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Loser: Substantive issues</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Look, it never seemed particularly likely that with these two candidates on stage this debate would be an enlightening and nuanced exchange about policy issues. Neither are wonks, Trump lies constantly, and every debate he has participated in ends up devolving into a mudslinging contest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, for anyone interested in substance, this debate was a truly desultory affair.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On abortion, Trump accused Biden of wanting to kill 9-month-old babies and Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/27/politics/read-biden-trump-debate-rush-transcript/index.html#:~:text=BIDEN%3A%20I%20supported%20Roe%20v.%20Wade%2C%20which%20had%20three%20trimesters.%20First%20time%20is%20between%20a%20woman%20and%20a%20doctor.%20Second%20time%20is%20between%20the%20doctor%20and%20an%20extreme%20situation.%20And%20a%20third%20time%20is%20between%20the%20doctor%20%E2%80%93%20I%20mean%2C%20it%E2%80%99d%20be%20between%20the%20woman%20and%20the%20state.">struggled to explain</a> <em>Roe v. Wade</em>’s three-trimester framework. On climate change, Trump bragged that while he was president the country had clean air and “H2O.” On the economy, Biden claimed Trump destroyed the economy in 2020, while Trump claimed Biden solely caused inflation and has only created jobs for migrants — all false.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The nadir was the supremely stupid exchange in which both candidates insulted each other’s golf games. “I’m happy to play golf if you carry your own bag,” Biden said. Trump responded by mocking Biden’s “swing.” Why?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winner: Kamala Harris</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back in March, Biden’s fiery State of the Union address quieted many concerns among Democrats over whether he was up to the rigors of another campaign. Now, the debate has reopened that topic of discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It will take more time (and polling numbers) to determine just how serious the damage to Biden is. Maybe mainly politics die-hards who have their minds made up were the people watching this very early debate. The media may focus on Biden’s age for a while, but attention will inevitably shift to other topics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the odds that Kamala Harris ends up the Democratic presidential nominee for 2024 are, in my view, higher after the debate than they were before it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic National Convention is at the end of August. Biden won the primaries and has most Democratic delegates pledged to him, so he can’t be totally pushed out against his will. But if power players in the party tell him that he has to step down — and he listens — then Harris would be the obvious next in line.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When this scenario has been discussed, it’s often been about an “open” convention, where delegates would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-elaine-kamarck.html">come together</a> to somehow choose their own nominee, as in older political eras. My guess is that this would be far too messy and impractical, and coordination and consensus-building around one option would be too difficult. There have been doubts within the party about Harris’s political strength, but if Democratic elites come to agree Biden is fatally politically flawed, they’d be more likely to roll the dice with her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, dropping Biden still seems very unlikely. But it seems less unlikely than it did Thursday morning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Three separate times during Thursday night’s debate, CNN’s moderators asked Donald Trump if he would commit to accepting the legitimacy of the 2024 election results regardless of who won. He never did.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, Trump said that he’d accept the results if he thought they were “fair and legal and good” — while at the same time repeating the false claim that the 2020 election was shot through with fraud (a claim that the moderators let stand).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Put together, the former president was all but openly telling us that he’s ready to repeat the campaign of lies and incitement that produced a mob attack on the Capitol less than four years ago. (He did offer a rote rejection of political violence.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That all of this felt normal, even expected, shows how much Donald Trump has warped our sense of what’s tolerable in America. Here was an authoritarian spouting falsehoods, ranting incoherently about policy, issuing thinly veiled threats against democracy, and somehow we’ve come to accept it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re all so used to this behavior, in fact, that we have trouble reminding ourselves how dangerous it is. I can guarantee Trump’s comments on the election won’t be the top headline at any major newspaper in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That honor will likely go to Joe Biden’s poor performance, and I can understand why. The president of the United States barely stringing a cogent answer together for the first hour of a nationally televised debate is indeed a major story. It seems like the critics <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html">warning about Biden’s age</a> had a point.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s something quietly obscene about Trump’s naked authoritarianism falling out of the frame. It wasn’t only these few comments about election results: It was his entire performance, <a href="https://x.com/nytimes/status/1806527958095474702">a cavalcade of lies</a> that betrayed a staggering contempt for the American public’s intelligence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday night, an authoritarian put his distaste for democracy on open display. Opposite him was a man who <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2024/01/05/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-third-anniversary-of-the-january-6th-attack-and-defending-the-sacred-cause-of-american-democracy-blue-bell-pa/">claims to care about democracy</a> above all else but has seemed wholly incapable of considering whether there might be some tension between its future and his own ambitions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blame Biden for running again. Blame the Democratic Party for failing to stop him. Blame CNN for burying the democracy questions halfway through the debate. Blame the Republicans for nominating Trump. Blame Trump, most of all, for acting the way he chooses to act — and his voters for standing by him while he does it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump reminded us tonight that he is uniquely unfit for office and hostile to our democracy. The fact that those qualities have lost their ability to shock underscores just how much the man has bent our politics to his will.</p>

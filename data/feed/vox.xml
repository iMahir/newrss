<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic Party lost the presidency to an <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/">unpopular</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/trump-2024-campaign-lewandowski-conway/680456/">indisciplined</a> authoritarian with a penchant for <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-hannibal-lecter-rant-origin.html">rambling incoherently about Hannibal Lecter</a> — again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite January 6, <a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court">the <em>Dobbs</em> decision</a>, and the GOP ticket’s many<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380588/trump-rally-racism-maga-stolen-election-claims"> forays</a> into <a href="https://www.vox.com/podcasts/372206/springfield-ohio-pets-haitian-immigrants-conspiracy?utm_campaign=vox.social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=voxdotcom&amp;utm_medium=social">racial incitement</a>, Americans not only elected Donald Trump on Tuesday, but — by all appearances — gave him a popular mandate: Ballots still need to be tabulated but, as of this writing, Trump is poised to win the popular vote by a hefty margin. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats also lost their Senate majority. If current results hold, Republicans will enjoy a 53-to-47 seat advantage in Congress’s upper chamber, and <a href="https://x.com/Redistrict/status/1854244169503371551">likely</a> narrow the House advantage. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this amounts to a crisis for Democrats. The only question is the scale of their challenge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The optimistic read of Election Day results is that the party drew a bad hand. Democrats faced a series of contingent headwinds in this particular election cycle — voter outrage over post-pandemic inflation, a rhetorically inept president, and an electorally undistinguished nominee — none of which are likely to burden them going forward. In this read, Democrats may need to adjust their tactics. But their basic strategic orientation remains sound. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet there is another, bleaker interpretation of Tuesday’s returns. From this vantage, Vice President Kamala Harris’s loss looks less like bad luck than the byproduct of deep, structural trends that will be difficult to reverse, especially once the GOP gets out from under Trump’s grip. For this reason, Democrats cannot realistically hope to wield control of the federal government without substantially revising the party’s agenda and messaging. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both perspectives are plausible. It is impossible to say with certainty which of these readings is closer to the truth. But I suspect that the Democrats’ problems are larger than the peculiar disadvantages they faced this election cycle. If the party does not take that possibility seriously, it risks condemning the United States to a period of reactionary rule that extends well beyond Trump’s second term — assuming it has not <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">already done so</a>.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why Democrats might be bound to bounce back</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case for chalking up Trump’s victory to contingent, ephemeral factors is fivefold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the past four years were a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents">very bad time to be in power</a>. The pandemic did real damage to the global economy, which governments papered over through deficit spending in 2020. But the bill for Covid-19 was always going to come due in 2021 and 2022. And virtually every party that happened to be in power at that time proceeded to suffer at the ballot box.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the onset of post-pandemic inflation, ruling parties either lost seats or control of government altogether in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rdygy5888o">Austria</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/uk-general-election-results-2024-intl/index.html">Britain</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/02/nx-s1-5097895/5-takeaways-germanys-regional-elections">Germany</a>, <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9629/">Italy</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/world/asia/japan-election.html">Japan</a>, among other nations. If polls <a href="https://abacusdata.ca/canadian-politics-abacus-data-september-2/">hold steady</a>, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s governing Liberal Party is poised for a landslide defeat in next year’s Canadian election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given this transcontinental desire for change, Democrats keeping the election close could be seen as a credit to the party’s political health. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, the Democrats’ senescent president compounded the harms of their unfortunate timing. The party spent the first leg of the general election campaign tethered to an octogenarian who lacked <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357876/biden-trump-debate-cnn-won-step-down-atlanta">basic proficiency in public speaking.</a> Biden’s conspicuous feebleness — and the Democrats’ initial compulsion to unite behind him, in defiance of the <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/americans-worried-bidens-age-long-debate/story?id=111858302">public’s wishes</a> — made it all the more difficult to overcome the public’s discontent with elevated prices.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Third, Harris was a suboptimal standard-bearer who owed her nomination more to circumstance than demonstrable electoral success. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s electoral track record prior to 2024 was unimpressive. In her first <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Attorney_General_election,_2010">statewide election in 2010</a>, she defeated a Republican in the California attorney general race by less than 1 percentage point (two years earlier, Barack Obama had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election_in_California">bested John McCain</a> by more than 23 points in that state). In 2020, Harris began her run for the Democratic nomination with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-more-billionaire-donors-than-any-other-democratic-candidate-2019-11">strong fundraising</a> and an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/09/politics/kamala-harris-first-good-month-poll-of-the-week/index.html">early surge in the polls</a>. Yet her campaign collapsed before the primary’s first ballots were cast.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Further, as a Californian whose Senate <a href="https://voteview.com/person/41701/kamala-devi-harris">voting record</a> put her on the left wing of her caucus, Harris was not an ideal figurehead for a party anxious to appeal to Trump-curious Midwesterners. And she compounded these liabilities by taking several unpopular stances during her 2020 primary campaign in a bid for progressive support, which the Trump campaign highlighted incessantly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Next time around, there will be an open Democratic primary, in which no sitting vice president (nor former one) will enjoy an advantage in name-recognition or party support. And if 2020 is any guide, the Democratic electorate will be eager to nominate a maximally electable nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fourth, Democratic Senate candidates in swing states <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383197/kamala-harris-results-underperformed-democratic-senate-candidates">ran far ahead of Harris on Tuesday night</a>. As of this writing, it looks like Democrats will win the Senate races in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, and Wisconsin. This suggests that swing-state voters may have been more discounted with the Biden-Harris administration than with the Democratic Party writ large. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Trump is all but certain to do many things that the public won’t like. His team is <a href="https://x.com/axios/status/1854167037586595937?s=46&amp;t=syanWdBLjOrIiRvOiGGOfQ">already signaling</a> it intends to move forward with mass deportation, a concept voters may like in the abstract, but which will <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24137666/trump-agenda-inflation-prices-dollar-devaluation-tariffs">yield price increases</a> they are sure to loathe and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/379883/mass-deportations-trump-harris-polling-immigration-border">humanitarian nightmares</a> that many will struggle to stomach. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Free of Biden and Harris’s personal liabilities — and from culpability for any economic discontents — Democrats will have an excellent shot of regaining the White House on a wave of anti-Trump backlash in 2028.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why the path of least resistance could lead Democrats deeper into the wilderness</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are reasons for fearing that the Democrats’ problems are deeper and more abiding than inflation, Biden’s age, or Harris’s imperfections. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the data available to us right now is imperfect. But the returns and voter surveys tell a consistent story: In 2024, two long-term trends in American voting behavior — that are highly unfavorable for Democrats — accelerated. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first is the rightward drift of working-class voters. Americans without college degrees have been shifting <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/education-polarization-diploma-divide-democratic-party-working-class.html">rightward for decades</a>, but Trump’s conquest of the GOP in 2016 greatly accelerated that trend. Biden fended off further erosion in his party’s working-class support four years later. But in 2024, working-class defections from blue America resumed. According to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-votecast-trump-harris-election-president-voters-86225516e8424431ab1d19e57a74f198">AP VoteCast,</a> Trump won non-college-educated voters by 4 points in 2020 — and by 12 points four years later. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To a large extent, Democrats have compensated for losses with working-class voters through gains with college graduates. But this did not happen in 2024: Harris did remarkably well with college educated, given her overall performance, but still lost about one point of support with the demographic relative to 2020, according to the AP survey. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, in a distinct — but likely related — development, Democrats lost ground with nonwhite voters. Harris actually won the same share of the white vote as Biden did in 2020 (43 percent), according to the AP’s figures. But her margin over Trump with Black voters was 14 points lower than Biden’s, while her advantage with Hispanic voters was 13 points smaller than the last Democratic nominees. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The AP VoteCast’s data is highly imperfect. But its basic story is consistent with the geographic pattern of Tuesday’s results. Florida, where only 52 percent of the population is non-Hispanic white, went for Trump by 13 points. In Hazleton, Pennsylvania — where 62 percent of residents are Hispanic — Democrats went from winning the presidential vote by 5 points in 2016 to losing it by 25 on Tuesday night. In Queens, one of the most diverse counties in the United States, the Democratic nominee’s margin over Trump was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-new-york-president.html">roughly 20 points</a> lower than it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-new-york.html">had been in 2020</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats lost ground almost everywhere. But they maintained support — or grew it — in some overwhelmingly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/11/05/compare-2020-2024-presidential-results/">white and affluent enclaves</a>, such as Cumberland County, Maine, and the Northwest Hills Planning Region of Connecticut. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These trends are concerning for at least two reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, there is a theoretical basis for believing that the trends derive from deep-seated, structural changes in American life and will therefore be difficult to fully reverse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Working-class voters have not only been drifting right in the United States for decades — they’ve also been doing so in <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/education-polarization-diploma-divide-democratic-party-working-class.html">virtually every Western nation</a>. The reasons for this are complex, but they relate to the weakening of trade unions amid deindustrialization, and the tendency of highly educated people to hold unusually cosmopolitan values — an inclination that spurs social conflict when college graduates become numerous enough to dominate cultural production and center-left politics. And trade unions are not going to become drastically more powerful — nor educated professionals, less multitudinous — anytime soon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, there’s long been reason to suspect that Hispanic and Black voters would grow less Democratic over time. For decades, Democrats have been relying on the votes of conservative nonwhites, whose support for the party derived less from <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/04/latinas-drove-trumps-gains-with-hispanic-voters-in-2020.html">ideological affinity</a> than inherited allegiances. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As many Hispanic American families enter their third and fourth generations, however, they tend to grow more assimilated. And if the political trajectory of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377802/latinos-trump-harris-immigration-assimilation-conser">previous immigrant groups was any guide</a>, Latinos were liable to become more Republican (and white identifying) as they gained more distance from the immigrant experience. And this would be especially true of the subset that was <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/04/latinas-drove-trumps-gains-with-hispanic-voters-in-2020.html">already temperamentally disposed to conservative politics</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, Democrats’ capacity to win roughly 90 percent of the Black vote, year in and year out, was arguably rooted in historical conditions that are gradually fading. As the political scientists Ismail K. White and Cheryl N. Laird argued in their 2020 book, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691199511/steadfast-democrats"><em>Steadfast Democrats: How Social Forces Shape Black Political Behavior</em></a>, the Black voting bloc is a product of African American communities internally policing norms of political behavior through social rewards and penalties. And such norm enforcement has historically been exceptionally effective due to the extraordinary degree of social cohesion that slavery and segregation fostered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As American society grows more integrated, and attendance declines at community institutions like the Black church, Laird and White predicted that there would be a “slow but steady diversification of Black partisanship,” as the norm of supporting Democrats grew harder to enforce.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tuesday’s result is consistent with that hypothesis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second cause for concern about these trends is that Trump’s retirement from politics could plausibly exacerbate them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats weren’t the only party facing unusual liabilities in 2024. The GOP was once again saddled with an unpopular, exceptionally undisciplined, and explicitly racist nominee.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be sure, Trump likely helped Republicans gain ground with non-college-educated voters in 2016 by forcing the party to embrace stances on immigration and entitlement spending that are popular with that demographic. And it is possible that his personal celebrity and charisma rendered him uniquely capable of reaching politically disaffected or disengaged constituencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, given that the rightward drift of working-class voters is a transnational phenomenon, a future Republican standard-bearer would have a good chance of building on Trump’s gains, particularly if they retained his positioning and populist rhetoric.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, were such a Republican to dispense with, say, allowing surrogates to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380588/trump-rally-racism-maga-stolen-election-claims">liken nonwhite ethnic groups to garbage, </a>they might do even better with Black and Hispanic voters than Trump did.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this wouldn’t be so damaging for Democrats, if the rightward drift of nonwhite and working-class voters ensured the leftward movement of college-educated whites. But there is no such guarantee. In fact, it is hard to imagine a GOP nominee more offensive to the sensibilities of the highly educated than Trump, a vulgar, anti-intellectual, misogynist who evinces contempt for democracy. If the GOP nominates a more ordinary Republican in 2028 — a near certainty, given Trump’s ineligibility for a third term — then Democrats could see their share of the college-educated vote fall, even as structural forces prevent a rebound in their Black and Hispanic support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally and least ambiguously, both the Biden and Harris coalitions are poorly equipped to compete for Senate control. As of this writing, it looks like Republicans will have a 53-seat Senate majority in the new Congress — even with Democratic Senate candidates winning a majority of races in swing states. Looking ahead to the 2026 and 2028 Senate maps, it is not easy to chart a path back to Democratic control. To win back the chamber, Democrats would need to beat Republicans in states that both Biden and Harris lost, while reelecting Democratic incumbents in purple states like Georgia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democrats’ weak position in the Senate is not coincidental; the body heavily <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/17/21011079/senate-bias-2020-data-for-progress">overrepresents non-college-educated voters</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, unless the party can broaden its support, it will be incapable of appointing Supreme Court justices or passing major legislation without Republicans’ help.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Democrats should plan for the worst</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is entirely possible that Trump’s misgovernance will solve the Democratic Party’s problems for it. If he follows through on his immigration and trade plans, he will <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24137666/trump-agenda-inflation-prices-dollar-devaluation-tariffs">engineer an economic disaster.</a> But Democrats should not bank on that (not least because it’s their responsibility to do whatever they can to prevent such a calamity from happening).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prudence demands that Democrats take the grimmest interpretation of Tuesday’s results seriously. The party’s eroding support from both working-class and nonwhite voters could render it uncompetitive in future presidential elections, and has already put it at a large disadvantage in the fight for Senate control.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats do not control their fate. A second Trump presidency threatens to pervert the democratic process in ways that entrench Republican power. But the party can try to make itself appealing to a broader share of Americans. And it must.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382945/kamala-harris-lost-donald-trump-why">Election night 2024</a> felt like the sequel to Election 2016: Many of the beats were the same, but the particulars were different. The early returns were ominous, and prospects did not improve from there. I was not as surprised, and yet it affected me as deeply if not more so. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you are anything like me, you have been trying to hold many different ideas in your head at once these past few days — and you still have a lot of questions. I won’t pretend to have all the answers, because nobody does. But we have collected your questions from the Vox Instagram page, our Explain It to Me inbox, and the Explain It to Me podcast phone line. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are four common queries from Vox’s readers and listeners, with my best read on them (with an assist from one of Vox’s most astute young political minds) as we sift through the fog of Election Week.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Did Trump overperform or did Harris underperform?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We all want to apportion blame or credit. Was Kamala Harris doomed by the political environment? Or did her campaign make missteps? Both can be true. Which one determined the outcome more?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The truth is, it’s hard to say what was determinative. Nate Silver can run 80,000 simulations of the election, but the rest of us only get to live through one reality. We can’t know the counterfactual and it will take time for <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/">the data that tells the story of this election</a> to come into focus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With that caveat out of the way, I am skeptical that Harris ever had a chance — and I’m more inclined to pin her loss on the conditions under which she was running, rather than the choices she made as she ran.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Something stuck out to me throughout election night: Whenever MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki would pull up some bellwether county in a swing state, he would compare the 2024 margins to 2020 and 2016. He would often point out Donald Trump was returning to his 2016 levels, while Harris trailed President Joe Biden’s 2020 performance, closer to (and yet usually above) Clinton in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/11/05/compare-2020-2024-presidential-results/">Look at this map from the Washington Post</a> that charts the shift from 2020 to 2024 in the presidential race by county. It’s red arrows all over. You should read exit polls with caution, but it would <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-harris-trump-women-latinos-black-voters-0f3fbda3362f3dcfe41aa6b858f22d12">appear</a> Trump made gains with voters across the board. That suggests to me there was a structural problem, as much as any strategic one, for Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Luckily, we don’t have to look far for structural explanations. Vox’s Zack Beauchamp <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents">wrote on the wave of anti-incumbency worldwide</a> that seems to have carried Trump and sunk Harris. It’s damaged conservatives (in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/358985/uk-labour-keir-starmer-tories-migration-politics-elections-july-4-rishi-sunak-boris-johnson">the UK</a>) and liberals (in <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/south-koreas-2024-general-election-results-and-implications">South Korea</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The constant is people being fed up with those in power after Covid-19 and the global inflation that followed. The aggregated economic indicators might still be solid, but wage growth has only <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383397/economy-inflation-2024-election-democrats-trump">narrowly outpaced</a> inflation. Consumers aren’t feeling flush with cash and slowing inflation does not mean <em>no</em> inflation. Interest rates have also stayed high, adding to the sense that things are expensive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America might also be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/aug/09/americans-conservative-obama-trump-joe-biden">a little more conservative</a> than Democrats thought, which is why Trump sought to portray Harris as an out-of-touch liberal. Maybe the Biden-Harris administration could have handled inflation better. But it’s vexed governments everywhere.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than anything, people were simply frustrated: <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx">In an October Gallup poll</a>, 72 percent of US adults said they were dissatisfied with how things were going in the country. It’s going to be hard for any incumbent national leader to win in that environment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s remember the state of the 2024 campaign <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">after the Biden-Trump debate</a> and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/08/14/harris-energizes-democrats-in-transformed-presidential-race/">the clear evidence</a> of improvement in Democrats’ chances after Harris took over. She attempted to circumvent Americans’ anger with the status quo by running as the challenger even while she was the sitting vice president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it didn’t work, and maybe it never could. People were sick of the Biden-Harris administration. They wanted a change. That’s what Trump was selling.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is Trump going to do?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s the big takeaway, beyond any specifics that could be subject to change: Trump is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24159069/trump-guardrails-authoritarian-democracy-second-term">less likely to be constrained</a> by other Republicans, by advisers who are more loyal to the office than him personally, and by democratic norms than he was during his first term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now for the specifics. The day after his victory, Trump’s campaign <a href="https://x.com/axios/status/1854167037586595937?s=46&amp;t=LVLwPwruc4koXd6hdIOe8Q">pledged</a> to start “the largest mass deportation operation” in US history on his first day back in office, a signal that he may be even more aggressive on his signature issue. He could enact those tariffs as he pleases <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374102/trump-harris-tariffs-congress">unless Congress stops him in the next two months</a>. His team has <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-day-one-election-victory-karoline-leavitt-1981319">telegraphed</a> an immediate expansion of oil and gas exploration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1852812012478398923">brashly said</a> that the Trump administration would advise the removal of fluoride from American water supplies on day one, a preview of the public health agenda likely to follow. We can also expect some kind of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/donald-trump-election-federal-agencies">shake-up within the federal bureaucracy</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is worth sounding a note of caution, however. Trump signed the so-called “Muslim ban” on January 27, 2017, but <a href="https://www.aclu-wa.org/pages/timeline-muslim-ban">it was blocked by the courts</a>, including the Supreme Court. It took him a year and a half to get an altered version okayed by the judiciary. Likewise, Trump’s attempt to approve <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/3/13/18263675/medicaid-work-requirements-lawsuit-donald-trump">Medicaid work requirements</a> was later stopped by a federal judge. One of the biggest questions of a second Trump term is: How much will the judiciary restrain him, if his own people won’t?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Congress, Trump and Republicans are already hankering to cut more taxes and slash the social safety net. But actually passing those plans is still going to be hard. Control of the House is still undecided and even if the GOP wins it, their margin will be extremely thin. <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/31/16055960/why-obamacare-repeal-failed">The failure to repeal Obamacare in 2017</a> is a very recent example of a newly minted Republican majority’s top priority failing because of public backlash.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What does Trump&#8217;s election mean for the world?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before the election even occurred, one Vox reader asked us: Why do US elections matter so much for the rest of the world?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US has <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/ranked-us-military-officially-most-powerful-2024-208664">the most powerful military in the world</a>, it is one of the two most important diplomatic players in global affairs (<a href="https://www.lowyinstitute.org/china-beats-united-states-top-2024-global-diplomacy-index">though China has caught up</a>), and its foreign aid programs are <a href="https://www.kff.org/health-policy-101-the-u-s-government-and-global-health/">a vital lifeline for humanitarian efforts</a> around the world. On foreign policy in particular, Trump has plenty of discretion to do as he pleases without much or any input from Congress.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know the consequences of this enormous power’s misuse. The US military has obviously been used for <a href="https://www.cfr.org/timeline/iraq-war">terrible ends</a>, US diplomacy can be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2024/us-sanction-countries-work/">ineffectual</a>, and US-funded humanitarianism has a mixed track record. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is why the fate of not only 330 million Americans but many millions more around the world was altered by Trump’s election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/353037/trump-gaza-israel-protests-biden-election-2024">Israel’s war in Gaza</a>, the effort to contain <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/366903/mpox-monkeypox-africa-continental-emergency-drc-who-clade">mpox in Africa,</a> the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/354112/sudan-darfur-el-fasher-genocide-humanitarian-aid-neglect">famine in Sudan</a>, the war in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0g7vuV-cyHA">Ukraine</a>, Taiwan’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24047940/china-us-war-taiwan-japan-key-role-explained">future as an independent nation</a> — these are some of the high-profile issues over which Donald Trump, rather than Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, will have significant leverage and influence. PEPFAR, the AIDS relief program that became the signature success of the bipartisan global health consensus that took shape under George W. Bush, <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief-pepfar/">will need to be reauthorized next year</a>, and there are signs of Republican support <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24036223/pepfar-aids-hiv-africa-global-health-george-w-bush-republicans-congress">wavering</a>. Trump will hold the veto pen during that congressional debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What will actually happen? I don’t know. But I know Trump’s election has defined what will be possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What do Democrats do now?</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to briefly hand the newsletter over to Vox senior political reporter Christian Paz, who sat down with Explain It To Me podcast host Jonquilyn Hill to analyze this year’s election and has as good of a read on the state of the Democratic Party as anyone:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s still this assumption that a diversifying America would inevitably lead to progressive or liberal or Democratic dominance, regardless of other factors, which once again, keeps being proven wrong and wrong. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, this election will be one where racial polarization decreases, especially among Latino voters. They voted similarly or in the similar direction or similar swing as white voters. The Democrats got the turnout they wanted, but it turns out that the voters that were turning out just didn&#8217;t want to vote for a Democrat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democrats bet a lot on educated and suburban voters, while expecting to maintain their previous margins with working-class voters of color and snagging enough white working-class voters to push them over the top. That bet didn’t pay off.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It will take months for Democrats to figure out how to recalibrate going forward, in the 2026 midterms and beyond. Looking at the 2024 fallout so far, Christian said, “There&#8217;s a mixed bag [in terms] of just what it is that the electorate wants.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Democrats struggle to come to terms with the results of this week’s election, some young women are looking abroad for inspiration. Women across social media have been exploring an idea called 4B, a protest movement in South Korea that calls for women to boycott men. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Now I am, how you say this, a ho, but I really want to get behind this 4B movement,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jhordanthemodel/video/7434529048241458462">begins one TikToker</a>, who goes on to say she approves of women withholding sex from men. “After this election — where women were pretty much told to their faces that no one gives a shit about them — don’t forget, ladies, we do have power. And you know the kind of power I’m talking about. Giving up our bodies to men is a choice. We don’t have to do this.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The TikTok tag <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search/video?q=4bmovement&amp;t=1731019154913">#4bmovement currently has thousands of posts</a> with millions of views, and Google search interest in the term <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%207-d&amp;geo=US&amp;q=4b&amp;hl=en">spiked after the election</a>. Some of the social media posters are clearly joking out of a combination of rage, stress, and sadness — but others are more serious. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Once you can get out of your mind that you will not be missing out by engaging in this behavior, you will be better off,” <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@professionalsassatron/video/7434571070348332330">one earnest TikToker says</a>. “I encourage you to reclaim your power and have really honest conversations with yourself about whether being in a romantic relationship with men at this point in time is worth it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a certain cohort of young American women, Donald Trump’s decisive victory appears to represent a breaking point. After the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, the reelection of the man who destroyed it, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/trump-voters-reactions.html">the virulent glee of a number of his male supporters at both</a>, some are toying with the idea of opting out of dealing with men altogether. Trump was elected in part by a generation of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/383364/gen-z-podcasts-trump-win-joe-rogan-bros">men steeped in hyper-macho rhetoric</a> about putting women in their place from figures like Andrew Tate. To the women distressed with the ascendance of these toxic bros, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysistrata">Lysistrata</a> solution seems not only justified but also potentially effective.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The birth of 4B</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 4B campaign developed primarily among feminist Korean Twitter users in 2017 and 2018 in conjunction with South Korea’s Me Too movement. It stems in part from the earlier and more popular tal-corset or Escape the Corset movement, which called for participants to cut their hair short or shave their heads, give up makeup, and abandon overtly feminine clothes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Named after the Korean prefix bi, or no, adherents are asked to follow four prohibitions: No heterosexual marriage, no heterosexual dating, no heterosexual sex, and no childbearing under any circumstances. While it’s hard to know how many South Korean women participate in 4B, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191207051222/https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3041058/why-south-korean-women-are-turning-their-backs-sex-marriage-and">the group self-reports a membership of 4,000 followers</a>. It’s niche, but it’s made itself heard in Korea and around the world. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both 4B and Escape the Corset are born of a society with strict gender norms and stringent beauty standards, and developed as a response to what participants see as the dehumanization of women in their culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One inflection point came in 2015, the year of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/6/5/8735037/what-is-mers-virus">MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) epidemic</a>, when a misogynistic smear campaign accused two Korean women of visiting MERS-plagued Hong Kong and refusing to test themselves before returning home. The whole MERS epidemic, the theory went, was the fault of two thoughtless, selfish, and flighty women. The internet lit up with violently sexist hate speech —&nbsp;but the story was untrue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Groups of women, outraged by the misogyny, started gathering on a MERS forum to talk about how they were done with men. In time, those online communities began to spill out into dedicated feminist websites, real-world rallies, and, eventually, the Escape the Corset movement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1177477181">The beauty expectations of South Korea are famously strict</a>;&nbsp;the country is home to the most plastic surgeons per capita of any other country in the world by far. As women joining the Escape the Corset movement began opting out of the beauty industry, they had a measurable effect on South Korea’s economy, with women in their 20s buying significantly <a href="https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1206&amp;context=dignity">fewer cosmetics, hair products, and other beauty products</a> in 2018 than they did in 2016, and plastic surgery expenditures going down by $58.3 billion in the same time period.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">New fronts kept opening up in Korea’s gender wars over the next several years. In 2016, a 34-year-old man <a href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/744756.html">stabbed to death a random woman</a> in her 20s in Seoul’s busy Gangnam neighborhood, saying, “I did it because women have always ignored me.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>If women’s sole social value was to be breeding animals and sexual objects, declared practitioners of 4B, then they would simply decline either to breed or to self-objectify.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The same year, the South Korean government unveiled a new initiative targeted at improving the country’s birth rate with a “birth map,” rendered in shades of pink to rank towns and cities by the number of women of childbearing age. “They counted fertile women like they counted the number of livestock,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/world/asia/south-korea-fertility-birth-map.html">one feminist blogger wrote at the time</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/south-korean-woman-jailed-over-nude-photo-of-male-model-1.3594777">More protests erupted in 2018</a> after a woman was imprisoned when she photographed a nude male model in her art class after he declined to cover his genitals during a class break, sharing the pictures on the internet to shame him. In South Korea, molka, or digital sex crimes involving nonconsensual images of women, <a href="https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/molka-digital-sex-crimes-south-korea/">had become a flourishing industry</a>, supplied by men armed with pinhole cameras waiting to videotape unsuspecting women in bathrooms, subway stations, or motel rooms. Despite a vocal protest movement pushing for stricter laws, <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/asia-pacific/south-korean-woman-jailed-over-nude-photo-of-male-model-1.3594777">only 9 percent of molka perpetrators</a>, mostly men, receive jail time. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2018, however, the woman in the art class was arrested, tried, and sentenced to 10 months in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For feminist activists, the incident epitomized the double standards under which South Korean law enforcement operated. Men who committed crimes against women were ignored or given a slap on the wrist, while women who committed those same crimes against men got the book thrown at them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For all of these problems —&nbsp;the sex crimes committed with impunity, the dehumanizing government initiatives, the law enforcement that only punished women — a solution became, eventually, 4B.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If women’s sole social value was to be breeding animals and sexual objects, declared practitioners of 4B, then they would simply decline either to breed or to self-objectify. They would opt out. They wouldn’t just forswear makeup. They would forswear marriage and sex and children. They would devote their lives to building their autonomy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4B in the US?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tenets of 4B are extremely different from the kinds of feminism that tend to flourish in the US, where popular culture places a premium on choice and empowerment. Mainstream feminist campaigns here usually celebrate women’s ability to make their own decisions and do whatever makes them feel best as individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The point of 4B and Escape the Corset, however, is not to make women feel more fulfilled or more at home in their bodies. It is also not to put pressure on men as individuals to reform their ways. The point of 4B is to send a message about the structure of society — to say it’s not acceptable that you are valued only for your fertility and sexual appeal — and to ensure your independence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1206&amp;context=dignity">an academic paper</a> about the movement, author Hyejung Park translates a 2019 video from the South Korean activist group SOLOdarity: “It is true that <em>tal-corset</em> [Escape the Corset] comes with some inconveniences,” the activists allow. “When your hair is short, you might have to get a haircut more frequently, and you might need to buy a whole new wardrobe for <em>tal-corset.</em> Nevertheless, we practice <em>tal-corset</em> because it is not about being more comfortable. It is about not being a doll, a second-class citizen.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It supposes a world that so emphatically decenters men and their desires for women that men themselves disappear from a woman’s life. </p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea of refusing to wear skirts for the sake of your politics, even if you like them, is an attitude that has been out of favor in American feminism since <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/3/20/16955588/feminism-waves-explained-first-second-third-fourth">the end of the second wave</a> in the 1970s. Still, there is a discipline and a radicalism to this form of activism that you can easily understand feeling attractive for America’s angry young women in this moment. It supposes a world that so emphatically decenters men and their desires for women that men themselves disappear from a woman’s life. After the US elected <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/381187/trump-access-hollywood-video-gen-z-tiktok">a symbol of masculine aggression and violence</a> to our highest office for the second time, a person can see the appeal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea of such severe and uncompromising protest also makes sense considering the reams of smirking rape jokes that the mere discussion of 4B online has provoked. Many American 4B TikToks have comments from men under them crowing, “Your body, my choice,” a refrain that young fans of far-right influencer <a href="https://x.com/ItsSamG/status/1854198526126805320">Nick Fuentes</a> have reportedly <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/helenofcoy.bsky.social/post/3laen4pavhu2p">taken to parroting in schools</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[W]omen threatening sex strikes like LMAO as if you have a say,” <a href="https://x.com/millerstream/status/1854247807735214298?s=46&amp;t=QLlX84ipkW3wjTELsZO2AQ">a post from one X account</a> with 122,000 followers went. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth remembering, though, that the divide between left and right in this country does not neatly map across gender divides. While we won’t know until later how the numbers break down, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/exit-polls-2024-election/">early exit polls say</a> 45 percent of all women and 53 percent of white women voted for Trump. Trump surrounds himself with enabling women, and the likes of Marjorie Tyler Greene <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/marjorie-taylor-greene-aoc-gender-politics/2021/05/14/c4c8d032-b405-11eb-a980-a60af976ed44_story.html">gleefully shriek misogyny</a> across the floors of Congress. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A possible lesson of the Women’s March era — that feminist reaction to the first Trump term — is this: Uniting in a large group as a pure expression of rage is not always sustainable. The Women’s March collapsed because of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/the-womens-march-in-year-3-can-the-movement-overcome-a-year-of-controversy-and-division/2019/01/17/0eb23740-18c9-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html">vicious infighting</a>, which is traditionally <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23528531">what happens to large leftist groups in the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps it’s time for American feminism to get specific and disciplined about its action points. 4B is specific and it is disciplined, which is part of what makes it difficult to translate out of its cultural context and into America. It is clear on its goals, which are to take personal autonomy through the force of one’s own denial, rather than to ask for it at the polls or in interpersonal relationships.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A line of inquiry American feminists might take from 4B is this: What are you going to work toward? And what are you going to do to get there?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The morning after Donald Trump won the presidential election this week, I stumbled out of bed and searched my bookshelf for a slim volume I hadn’t looked at in years: <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23467058/mans-search-for-meaning-frankl-holocaust-memoir-wellness-instagram"><em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em></a><em> </em>by Viktor Frankl.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Frankl knew a thing or two about living through a time of rising authoritarianism. A Viennese Jew born in the early 20th century, he was a budding psychiatrist and philosopher when he was sent to the Nazi concentration camps just months after he got married. His wife and other family members died in the camps —&nbsp;but he survived.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are not, thank goodness, facing a situation even remotely as grave as Frankl’s. But <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/14/23958866/trump-vermin-authoritarian-democracy">Trump has given us every reason to fear</a> that he <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">plans to hollow out American democracy</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/381636/trump-2024-democracy-threat-orban-second-term">aspires to authoritarian rule.</a> A big part of what makes that scary is the sense that our agency will be severely constrained —&nbsp;that, for example, even more of us will become unfree to make <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381773/trump-win-election-abortion-ban-filibuster-dobbs">decisions about our own bodies</a>. And that can lead to despair.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is exactly where Frankl can help us: He argued that human beings always have agency, even when we’re facing a horrible reality that it’s too late to undo. “When we are no longer able to change a situation,” he wrote, “we are challenged to change ourselves.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We do that, Frankl said, by choosing how we make meaning out of the situation. His own experience in the camps helped him crystalize his philosophy and the branch of psychotherapy he pioneered: logotherapy (which literally translates to “meaning-therapy”). He practiced it in the camps, ministering to fellow inmates hungry for a way to make meaning of their suffering. After the Holocaust was over, he advocated for it to be used with all sorts of people, since the human search for meaning is universal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was where Frankl broke with his intellectual forebear, Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis who believed that people are driven by the &#8220;pleasure principle&#8221; — an instinct to seek immediate gratification. “It is one of the basic tenets of logotherapy that man’s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life,” Frankl wrote in <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Frankl was inspired by proto-existentialist philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche, who fought against nihilism, or despair at the meaninglessness of life, and replaced it with a firm conviction: Life may not come with any built-in meaning — but that just means we have to create meaning ourselves. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Frankl’s core idea — that life is potentially meaningful under any condition, because human beings always retain the freedom to express our values in how we respond to life’s tragedy — can offer a philosophical tonic for the many people feeling despair right now. If you’re one of them, read on.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Frankl’s advice is to ask yourself, “What does life expect of me?”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In times of despair, many of us feel like all our actions are futile, so there’s no point in even trying. We ask ourselves: What’s the meaning of it all, anyway?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his book <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/yes-to-life-in-spite-of-everything-viktor-e-frankl/15081950"><em>Yes to Life: In Spite of Everything</em></a>, Frankl turns the question upside down:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point it would be helpful [to perform] a conceptual turn through 180 degrees, after which the question can no longer be <em>“What can I expect from life?”</em> but can now only be <em>“What does life expect of me?”</em> What task in life is waiting for me?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The question of the meaning of life is not asked in the right way, if asked in the way it is generally asked: it is not we who are permitted to ask about the meaning of life — it is life that asks the questions, directs questions at us… We are the ones who must answer, must give answers to the constant, hourly question of life.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, we’re accustomed to thinking that life owes us answers, but Frankl says it’s just the opposite: Life itself is constantly asking us a question — how will you face up to this situation? And this one? And this one? — and it’s our responsibility to answer. The answers we must give are different in every moment, because every moment demands something new of us: When a new president takes power, for instance, we each have to consider afresh how best to use our particular talents and resources to meet the demands of the new political reality:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">The question life asks us, and in answering which we can realize the meaning of the present moment, does not only change from hour to hour but also changes from person to person: the question is entirely different in each moment for every individual.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">We can, therefore, see how the question as to the meaning of life is posed too simply, unless it is posed with complete specificity, in the concreteness of the here and now. To ask about “the meaning of life” in this way seems just as naive to us as the question of a reporter interviewing a world chess champion and asking, “And now, Master, please tell me: which chess move do you think is the best?” Is there a move, a particular move, that could be good, or even the best, beyond a very specific, concrete game situation, a specific configuration of the pieces?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means that the task of making meaning out of life is never complete —&nbsp;it’s something we have to show up for over and over again. And Frankl argued that we do that by looking not inward, but outward at the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under normal conditions, we might make meaning by creating or doing something that feels valuable, like writing a novel. Or we might revel in experiencing the beauty of nature or love for another human being. But when the elements of a good and stable life are being taken away, there is still a way to make meaning: We can come face to face with suffering and express our values in how we respond to it. That is a capacity that nobody can take away from us.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How to live out Frankl’s “tragic optimism” by recommitting to your values</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the end of <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em>, Frankl stakes out a position he calls “tragic optimism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The philosopher did not believe that human nature is all good or all bad. In fact, he saw both naive optimism and pure pessimism as forms of nihilism: Both views imagine the human being as having a nature that is perfectly settled in advance, so both views rob the human being of agency. Instead, Frankl preferred to see people as beings who are constantly choosing, who have the freedom to make their own meaning even amid the most tragic circumstances.<br><br>Frankl himself embodied that in the camps, where he knew the odds of surviving were very slim. And he recounts a moment that I find incredibly moving:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">It did not even seem possible, let alone probable, that the manuscript of my first book, which I had hidden in my coat when I arrived at Auschwitz, would ever be rescued. Thus, I had to undergo and to overcome the loss of my mental child. And now it seemed as if nothing and no one would survive me; neither a physical nor a mental child of my own! So I found myself confronted with the question whether under such circumstances my life was ultimately void of any meaning.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Not yet did I notice that an answer to this question with which I was wrestling so passionately was already in store for me, and that soon thereafter this answer would be given to me. This was the case when I had to surrender my clothes and in turn inherited the worn-out rags of an inmate who had already been sent to the gas chamber immediately after his arrival at the Auschwitz railway station. Instead of the many pages of my manuscript, I found in a pocket of the newly acquired coat one single page torn out of a Hebrew prayer book, containing the most important Jewish prayer, <em>Shema Yisrael</em>. How should I have interpreted such a &#8220;coincidence&#8221; other than as a challenge to <em>live</em> my thoughts instead of merely putting them on paper?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Frankl interpreted the page as a sign that the man had “entered those gas chambers upright” —&nbsp;that he’d chosen to stick to his faith even as he faced death, and that, in fact, he’d become a walking embodiment of his faith, with no more need for a page describing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He found many ways to “live his thoughts” in the camps. Frankl describes, for instance, how he chose to respond with dignity to a Nazi officer who beat him as he did hard labor in the freezing cold. And how he chose to treat typhus patients in one of the camps. “I decided to volunteer,” he wrote, because “if I had to die there might at least be some sense in my death. I thought that it would doubtless be more to the purpose to try and help my comrades as a doctor.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we’re facing in the US today is not comparable to what Frankl faced during World War II. But his philosophy and the way he personally embodied it offers us a helpful reminder: Now is the time to live our thoughts. To ask ourselves what our values are —&nbsp;and then get to work enacting them.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are lots of things to be concerned about as America enters a second term under Trump. What will happen to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381773/trump-win-election-abortion-ban-filibuster-dobbs">pregnant people</a>? What will happen to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/383186/trump-vance-medicaid-food-stamps-obamacare-poverty">low-income people</a>? What will happen to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/383286/chart-trump-immigration-crackdown-private-prison">undocumented people</a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As you consider what worries you, think about the very real actions you can take now to “live your thoughts.” For example, if you’re concerned about undocumented people, you can consider donating to an effective nonprofit like the <a href="https://refugeerights.org/">International Refugee Assistance Project</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23569848/how-to-sponsor-refugees-welcome-corps-biden">sponsoring a refugee family</a> to resettle in your community. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Will your actions change everything? Probably not. But they may change some things for some individuals. And even if they do not — as Frankl reminds us, sometimes it’s beyond your control to change a painful situation — you will know that you are living out your responsibility to the world and helping build a foundation for the future you want to see.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“With this mental standpoint nothing can scare us anymore, no future, no apparent lack of a future,” Frankl writes. “Because now the present is everything as it holds the eternally new question of life for us.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or, to put it another way: Life does not owe you answers, but you still owe answers to life.<br><br><br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And when slaughterhouses became Covid-19 hot spots in the early days of the pandemic, Trump — at the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/emails-show-the-meatpacking-industry-drafted-an-executive-order-to-keep-plants-open">behest of the meat industry</a> — demanded they remain open, even as schools and offices closed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a second term, with what could well be a unified Republican government, Trump could go further in weakening animal protections, given his corporate-friendly, deregulatory tendencies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“He now has much more active involvement from intelligent and strategic people whose mission is to reduce — if not eliminate — federal regulation of businesses, including animal-using businesses that already get a light touch” from regulators, <a href="https://www.vermontlaw.edu/faculty/winders-delcianna">Delcianna Winders</a>, director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at Vermont Law and Graduate School, told me. (Disclosure: Last summer, I attended a media fellowship program at Vermont Law and Graduate School.)&nbsp;And while most federal regulatory employees in agencies like the US Department of Agriculture are civil servants, Trump has promised to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">reclassify</a> them as political appointees so he can fire and replace them with loyalists to advance his deregulatory agenda.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, some of the people high up in Trump’s orbit, despite their reactionary views on other social issues, have indicated relatively pro-animal welfare or anti-factory farming beliefs. Some in a second term could wind up in positions to advance animals’ interests, like <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/29/lara-trump-pet-problem-238906">Lara Trump</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/should-conservatives-care-about-animal-cruelty-lewis/id1679444703?i=1000666907585">Vivek Ramaswamy</a>, and <a href="https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/blogs/ag-policy-blog/blog-post/2024/04/02/rfk-jrs-plan-weaponize-regulators">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> — though Kennedy could do <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381470/trump-rfk-cabinet-hhs-vaccines-health">plenty of damage</a> to human beings if put in a position of authority on health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether they’ll use their influence to help animals in a second Trump term is unknown to unlikely. But there’s a sliver of precedent they could build on, as Trump’s first term wasn’t all bad for animals. For example, his Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Secretary Andrew Wheeler sought to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-wheeler-signs-memo-reduce-animal-testing-awards-425-million-advance">significantly reduce</a> animal testing with the goal of replacing most of it with alternative methods by 2035, and other federal agencies cut back on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/no-more-kitten-slaughterhouse-government-halts-deadly-cat-experiments-n990011">kitten</a>, <a href="https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-to-conduct-in-depth-internal-review-of-existing-canine-research-projects/">dog</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/health/fda-monkeys-nicotine.html">monkey testing</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/wcw_nih.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,7.7517575041737,100,84.496484991653" alt="A monkey in a cage." title="A monkey in a cage." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The death of Moby (pictured) and three other squirrel monkeys used in a US Food and Drug Administration study on nicotine addiction resulted in the shuttering of the research in 2018 and prompted the agency to build a council to oversee its animal studies. | US Food and Drug Administration/White Coat Waste" data-portal-copyright="US Food and Drug Administration/White Coat Waste" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">And for all the very real differences between President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the truth is that when it comes to animal welfare, there’s not much daylight between the parties. President Joe Biden’s EPA last year <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2023/dec/13/trump-put-epa-on-course-to-end-animal-testing-bide/">reversed</a> the Trump EPA’s animal testing phase-out, while his Justice Department <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">sided with the pork industry</a> in a Supreme Court case over a landmark California law that banned locking pigs in tiny cages. Biden’s US Fish and Wildlife Service recently sought to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gray-wolves-protections-biden-trump-81084b1bba499d444950f8294880c524">revive</a> a Trump-era rule that eliminates protections for gray wolves after environmental groups had successfully sued to stop it. Minnesota Gov. and Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/373954/tim-walz-piglet-factory-farming-climate">as I wrote previously</a>, also has a long, cozy relationship with the factory farm industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That animal protection remains a politically homeless cause was further underscored elsewhere in Tuesday’s election, as animal issues <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/377096/sonoma-county-denver-factory-farming-slaughterhouse-ban-ballot-measures">on the ballot</a> in state and local jurisdictions across the US lost resoundingly, illustrating that voters may not be ready for more ambitious animal welfare laws.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Animals lost big at the ballot box&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Denver, 64 percent of voters <a href="https://denverite.com/2024/11/05/denver-2024-general-election-updates/">rejected</a> a ballot measure to <a href="https://denverite.com/2024/11/05/denver-ballot-measure-309-results-2024-elections/">ban slaughterhouses</a>, which would have closed the largest lamb slaughterhouse in the US. A recently released <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/10/09/lamb-slaughter-ban-superior-farms-denver-ordinance-309/">investigation</a> of the facility, conducted by an animal rights group, documented injured lambs that are unable to walk being kicked and pushed toward slaughter; lambs hanging upside down on the slaughter line and still thrashing after their throats were slit; employees laughing and spanking animals; and the alleged use of “Judas sheep” — adult sheep used to lead lambs to slaughter.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fifty-eight percent of Denverites also voted against a ban on the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/11/05/denver-initiated-ordinance-308-309-election-results/">sale of fur</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the losses, Pro-Animal Future, the group behind the Denver ballot measures, celebrated the fact that more than a third of the city’s voters were willing to vote for a far-reaching measure as banning slaughterhouses — even as the campaign was outspent 6-to-1 by a coalition of national and state meat industry groups, restaurants, and labor unions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;This was a bold campaign, and no one said changing the status quo was going to be easy,&#8221; Pro-Animal Future spokesperson Olivia Hammond said in a press release. &#8220;Over 100,000 meat eaters voted for a world without slaughterhouses, and that&#8217;s a foundation we&#8217;ll continue building on. Voters aren&#8217;t used to seeing animal rights on the ballot, and we are paving the way with this campaign.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The CEO of the lamb slaughterhouse called supporters of the ban “<a href="https://denverite.com/2024/11/05/denver-ballot-measure-309-results-2024-elections/">losers</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the state level, meanwhile, with three-quarters of the votes counted, Coloradans <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/colorado-election-results-maps-live-vote-count-2024/">voted 55.5 to 44.5</a> against a prohibition on <a href="https://www.cpr.org/2024/11/05/proposition-127-big-cat-hunting-ban-results/">trophy hunting</a> mountain lions, lynx, and bobcats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And in Sonoma County, California, where nearly <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/california-2024-election-results-map-shows-county-by-county-live-count/">75 percent</a> of voters cast ballots for Harris, only <a href="https://www.ktvu.com/election/sonoma-county-election-results-2024">15 percent</a> supported Measure J, an initiative to phase out large factory farms, which would’ve closed as many as <a href="https://norcalpublicmedia.org/2024110696713/news-feed/measure-j-loses">21 operations</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“While the opportunity to alleviate animal suffering and move our society in a better direction fell short today, we&#8217;ve always known that this will take time and we trust that people are going to get there,” the Coalition to End Factory Farming campaign, which advocated for Measure J, said in a statement. The campaign was outspent 8-to-1 by the measure’s opposition, which was funded by large meat and dairy companies and trade groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Florida, with more than 95 percent of votes counted, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-florida.html#I">67 percent</a> of voters supported an amendment to enshrine a constitutional right to hunt and fish. Florida law already protects both of these activities, and <a href="https://www.everglades.org/vote-no-on-amendment-2/">environmental advocates argue</a> that the measure’s vague language could enable hunters to use more violent methods of trapping and killing wildlife.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While voters have in the past overwhelmingly supported <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/10/9/23393017/supreme-court-pork-pigs-prop-12-california-animal-welfare">bans on tiny cages</a> for farmed animals (I worked on one of these in <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2016/11/08/question-three-animal-confinement-results">Massachusetts in 2016</a> when I worked for the Humane Society of the US), the proposed outright bans on factory farms and slaughterhouses in Sonoma County and Denver were too much even for some of the bluest parts of the country. The rejection of the fur sales ban in Denver came as more of a surprise, considering that voters in nearby Boulder <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2021/11/12/humane-clothing-act-boulder/">passed</a> one in 2021. California’s legislature, along with localities in Massachusetts, Michigan, and Florida, have also banned fur (though not via ballot initiatives).&nbsp;</p>

Voters in numerous states have banned the crates via ballot measures. | Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals Media" data-portal-copyright="Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals Media" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The agricultural measures faced criticism from both the agricultural industry and some fellow anti-factory farming advocates, who argued that they’d just <a href="https://cornbeltconfidential.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-local-cafo-bans">displace</a> meat production elsewhere. They likely faced cultural headwinds, too, given that Denver is in a state proud of its ranching industry, and Sonoma County — an area with both higher-welfare organic farms and conventional factory farms — takes pride in its farming heritage.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some critics of the Sonoma County ballot measure argued that, despite its good intentions, it was poorly crafted and went far ahead of where voters stand on the issue.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dena Jones, a former farm animal program director at the nonprofit Animal Welfare Institute, told Vox the Denver slaughterhouse and Sonoma County factory farm bans were “ill-advised.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I found it very hard to believe in either case that either one of those could be successful,” she said, “and I thought the backlash might make it more of a loss than a gain.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever the shortcomings of these ballot measures, the fierce opposition they faced in blue strongholds highlights how resistant Democratic voters can be to more ambitious meat industry reforms, even though meat production heavily contributes to issues central to progressives’ agenda: <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf">climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">environmental pollution</a>, and <a href="https://civileats.com/2024/10/23/the-fate-of-denvers-last-slaughterhouse-is-on-the-ballot/">labor exploitation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to prevent animal cruelty, whoever’s in office</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The losses should come as a sobering moment for the animal rights movement. Voters have been able to stomach modest reforms, like bans on cages for farm animals, which ask little of them besides slightly higher prices for meat and eggs. The economic effects of such measures are also diffused throughout entire industries, as opposed to one city or county — or in the case of Denver, a single slaughterhouse — which may make voters more fearful of impacts to their local communities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These dynamics ought to weigh heavily into how activists plan future ballot measures. Currently, animal rights groups in Oregon are collecting signatures for a <a href="https://www.yesonip28.org/">2026 ballot initiative</a> that would dramatically curtail — if not outright eliminate — animal farming, animal testing, and other business activities that rely on animals in the state. That’s an unpopular proposition to everyone but the most strident vegans, though the theory behind the ballot measure is noteworthy: It works by removing many of the sweeping exemptions carved into Oregon’s anti-animal cruelty laws for agriculture and other animal-using industries, thereby revealing how these businesses depend on legalized animal abuse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As to how animal advocates should approach the next Trump administration, Jones said, the prospects for new federal animal welfare legislation or regulations are dim. But there are opportunities to improve enforcement of the few federal laws that do protect animals, like the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act and the Animal Welfare Act. These are primarily enforced by civil servants, not political appointees, so enforcement would be less politically charged than lobbying for new policies altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I&#8217;ve done policy work for animals for 30 years,” said Jones, “and it is possible to make progress for animals” in both Republican and Democrat administrations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that progress will be harder to forge if Trump follows through on his vow to mass fire civil servants and replace them with sycophants.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jones also challenges animal advocates to view their issues from a conservative mindset to better appeal to both parties. Anti-animal testing nonprofit White Coat Waste has <a href="https://www.theamericansaga.com/p/how-republicans-and-democrats-are">found success</a> — like the phasing out of some cruel animal studies — by working with both Republican and Democratic members of Congress. The group advocates for reductions in animal testing on the basis of not just compassion for animals, but also conservative values like reducing taxpayer waste.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You need to look at issues where the interest of the agency, the industry, and animal protection or environmental protection overlap,” said Jones. “There always are some.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a key test of public attitudes toward homelessness after the <a href="https://www.vox.com/homelessness/357861/homelessness-encampment-grants-pass-supreme-court-housing">Supreme Court greenlit broader camping bans</a> this past summer, Arizona voters <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/alispdfs/Council/2024BallotMeasures/adopted%20analysis%20Proposition%20312%20HCR2023%20-%202024.pdf">approved a measure</a> that will allow property owners to claim tax refunds if their local governments fail to clear out encampments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Proposition 312, which passed this week with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-arizona-proposition-312-allow-tax-refund-for-public-nuisance-costs.html">58 percent of the vote</a>, was born from a bitter fight in Phoenix <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/19/us/phoenix-businesses-homelessness.html">over &#8220;The Zone,&#8221;</a> an area where more than 1,000 homeless people once camped near the state capitol building. It marks conservatives&#8217; latest effort to push local governments toward tougher and less discretionary enforcement of outdoor homelessness. Its success with voters suggests openness to more aggressive enforcement of public camping as cities grapple with their recently affirmed powers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The measure will create a new system allowing property owners to recoup expenses like security cameras, cleaning services, and protective fencing when cities demonstrate a &#8220;pattern or practice&#8221; of not enforcing laws against camping, loitering, or public drug use. (To claim the refund, property owners must prove that lax enforcement reduced their property values or led to costs related to addressing public &#8220;nuisance&#8221; issues.) Those refunds would come directly from money that cities get from the state, effectively penalizing local governments that don&#8217;t crack down on encampments. Individuals will be allowed to submit one claim per year, for up to 10 years.<br><br>Proponents, led by the conservative Goldwater Institute, promoted the measure as a way to prevent another crisis like &#8220;The Zone.&#8221; Opponents, however, argue it will divert already scarce resources from shelters, public services, and law enforcement, ultimately diminishing cities&#8217; ability to tackle homelessness on a broader scale.<br><br>“Ever heard the saying, ‘the beatings will continue until morale improves?’” asked two local leaders in <a href="https://apps.azsos.gov/election/BallotMeasures/2024/Prop_312_Against_Arguments.pdf">arguments submitted to Arizona’s secretary of state</a>. “Why would we try to force cities to do something they can&#8217;t do, then punish them for not being able to do it?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Arizona voters approved a harmful, counterproductive, and shortsighted ballot initiative that will make homelessness worse,” said Jesse Rabinowitz,&nbsp; the campaign and communications director at the National Homelessness Law Center. “Proposition 312 fails to address the lack of affordable housing that causes homelessness, burdens local governments, and will drive up legal costs that will be passed on to taxpayers.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The initiative will take effect as Arizona faces one of the nation&#8217;s most severe <a href="https://azbigmedia.com/real-estate/affordable-housing-crisis-in-arizona-heres-what-analysis-shows/">affordable housing shortages</a>, with <a href="https://www.commonsenseinstituteus.org/arizona/research/housing-and-our-community/homelessness-spending-in-arizona">some 14,000 people</a> experiencing homelessness on any given night.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The voters sent a clear message this election cycle: they demand their tax dollars be used to enforce the law and address rampant homelessness,” Goldwater President and CEO Victor Riches <a href="https://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/prop-312-victory-relief-is-here-for-arizonans-paying-the-price-for-homeless-crisis/">said in a statement</a> Wednesday morning. “Now that Prop 312 is law, business and property owners will not be left holding the bag when municipalities refuse to do their job.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conservatives want clearing homeless tent encampments to be non-negotiable</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Arizona measure represents conservatives&#8217; most ambitious attempt yet to remove local discretion from homeless enforcement. While the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling in June cleared the way for more uninhibited camping bans, local officials are still left with significant flexibility over whether and how to clear encampments. For advocates frustrated with what they see as progressive cities&#8217; reluctance to act, Proposition 312&#8217;s tax refund mechanism offers a template for forcing their hands.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;Many cities have used legal uncertainty as an excuse — they throw up their hands and say, &#8216;Our hands are tied,'&#8221; Ilan Wurman, a law professor who helped craft early lawsuits against Phoenix over &#8220;The Zone,&#8221; <a href="https://www.vox.com/homelessness/357861/homelessness-encampment-grants-pass-supreme-court-housing">told me this summer</a>. &#8220;The Supreme Court took that argument away, but it still doesn&#8217;t require them to do anything. That&#8217;s why we need tools … to ensure enforcement actually happens.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The push for non-discretionary enforcement has been gaining momentum. Florida recently <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/375765/florida-homelessness-hurricane-helene-encampment-disaster-fema-housing-crisis-storm">enacted a law allowing</a> residents and businesses to sue cities that don&#8217;t clear encampments, and Missouri now permits <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2023/01/17/advocates-providers-scramble-as-missouris-new-homelessness-law-goes-into-effect/">its attorney general to take legal action</a> against local governments that fail to enforce camping bans. Arizona&#8217;s approach of targeting municipal budgets marks a new addition to these litigation-based strategies. Wurman, who recently filed a new <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25119695/fieldwork-et-al-v-city-of-berkeley-street-camp-lawsuit.pdf">public nuisance lawsuit in Berkeley, California</a> over tent encampments, told me Prop 312 will “certainly help put pressure on cities.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Cicero Institute, an Austin-based conservative think tank known for helping cities and states draft public camping bans and advocating for a shift away from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23504323/housing-first-homelessness-houston-homes">bipartisan &#8220;Housing First&#8221; approach to homelessness</a>, voiced its support for Proposition 312 on Wednesday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Cicero Institute supports community-approach solutions to homelessness that balance the needs of unhoused individuals with the rights of their housed neighbors,” Stefani Buhajla, the director of communications, told Vox. “Proposition 312 offers a mechanism for citizens to hold municipalities accountable when they fail to ensure public safety or leave vulnerable people to life on the streets.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But critics, including law enforcement leaders, warn the approach could backfire. &#8220;I think they really want to force the hand of government to do what they want. But you cannot arrest away homelessness,&#8221; Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/10/25/arizona-prop-312-unhoused-ballot-measure">told the Marshall Project last month</a>, noting that jails are already straining to provide mental health and addiction resources. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Joe and Debbie Faillace, two business owners who worked in downtown Phoenix, say the spiraling homelessness crisis forced them to sell their sandwich shop. The couple applauded the passage of Prop 312, saying it “gives us hope that not only will the city of Phoenix not allow another ‘Zone’ to happen, but that even [if] it does, the government will have to compensate small businesses like ours for failing to protect our rights.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What comes next</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The measure now sets up a complex implementation challenge for Arizona cities, which must balance their reduced discretion against practical and legal constraints. The initiative&#8217;s language leaves key questions unanswered: What constitutes a &#8220;pattern&#8221; of non-enforcement? Which expenses qualify as reasonable? How will cities prove they&#8217;re adequately enforcing the law?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-04-24/homeless-encampments-arizona-california-ballot-november-election">told the LA Times</a> that the effects of the proposal could range from minimal “to devastating to our budget.” Even processing the claims will consume city resources, she added – resources that might otherwise go toward expanding shelter capacity or funding outreach workers. Gallego <a href="https://www.azfamily.com/2024/11/06/kate-gallego-reelected-phoenix-mayor-defeats-matt-evans/">was reelected</a> on Tuesday night.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The city&#8217;s experience clearing &#8220;The Zone&#8221; offers a preview of the balancing act ahead. When Phoenix finally dismantled the encampment last year, it did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/10/us/phoenix-homeless-camp-the-zone.html">so block by block over several months</a>, offering indoor alternatives and storage for belongings. That systematic approach helped the city avoid legal challenges over property rights, but similar caution or delay could now expose Phoenix to tax refund claims.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As other states watch Arizona&#8217;s experiment unfold, the measure&#8217;s impact may extend far beyond managing encampments. The initiative represents a fundamental shift in how cities approach homelessness policy — leveraging public budgets, rather than court orders or state laws, to compel enforcement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even the measure&#8217;s supporters acknowledge that enforcement alone won&#8217;t solve the underlying crisis. Arizona has one of the nation&#8217;s most severe shortages of affordable housing, with only Nevada having fewer affordable units per capita for extremely low-income renters, <a href="https://nlihc.org/gap?utm_source=NLIHC+All+Subscribers&amp;utm_campaign=9b96f4c7b4-report_042122&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e090383b5e-9b96f4c7b4-293444466&amp;ct=t(report_042122)">according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Arizona must focus on the true solution to homelessness — housing and optional services — not punishing people who sleep outside because they have nowhere else to go,” said Rabinowitz, of the National Homelessness Law Center. “As similar anti-homeless bills spread across the country, we demand that our elected officials not only reject these simple-minded and backward half measures and focus on what works: housing, not handcuffs.”</p>

But after Musk <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-election-night.html">spent at least $119 million</a> to get Trump elected and turned his platform <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/technology/elon-musk-x-election.html?campaign_id=4&amp;emc=edit_dk_20241104&amp;instance_id=138603&amp;nl=dealbook&amp;regi_id=27132078&amp;segment_id=182153&amp;user_id=22aa1351f691b042384fa3531e08c414">into a MAGA megaphone</a> — and then Trump won — the social media site’s real value is starting to take new shape.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the day his Twitter purchase went through, Musk <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elon-musk-to-acquire-twitter-301532245.html">vowed</a> to make free speech central to the platform’s future. He purged the company’s trust and safety staff, setting a precedent that <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-trust-safety-industry/">other social media companies followed</a>. Since then, however, Musk has been willing to let authoritarian regimes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235213/x-brazil-suppression-speech-elon-musk-india-turkey">dictate how X will work</a> in their countries. In the United States, more free speech on X meant more misinformation and an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/">embrace of right-wing politics</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">X is certainly not the biggest social media platform, but as other major platforms <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/17/us/politics/trump-disinformation-2024-social-media.html">continue to shy away from policing content</a> and Trump heads back to the White House, X certainly looks more influential than it did last week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might not like this. Since <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html">buying the platform</a> in 2022, Musk has helped turn X into an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/wrong-claims-by-musk-us-election-got-2-billion-views-x-2024-report-says-2024-11-04/">epicenter of election misinformation</a>. With 203 million followers, Musk has the biggest reach on X and is the platform’s <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2024/'">most prominent pusher of anti-immigrant conspiracy theories</a> and right-wing propaganda. At Musk’s request last year, X <a href="https://www.platformer.news/yes-elon-musk-created-a-special-system/">changed the site’s algorithm</a> to put his posts in more people’s feeds — posts that increasingly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/technology/elon-musk-x-election.html">urged people not to trust the outcome of the election</a>. The nonprofit <a href="https://counterhate.com/about/">Center for Countering Digital Hate</a> estimates that Musk’s misleading posts about the election have been viewed <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/04/media/elon-musk-election-x-misinformation-trump-harris/index.html">more than 2 billion times</a> this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gone are the warning labels that Twitter <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/9/10/21430895/twitter-voter-suppression-policies-trump-civic-integrity">once used</a> to flag false or misleading information. Musk replaced that system with a crowd-sourced fact-checking program called Community Notes. He called it “the best source of truth on the internet.” Unfortunately, the new system <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/30/elon-musk-x-fact-check-community-notes-misinformation/">doesn’t work very well</a>.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2182521573.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729549760201,100,78.540900479598" alt="Elon Musk and Melania Trump stand with Musk’s young son at a Trump rally.

<p class="has-text-align-none">So if your feed feels as though it’s especially full of right-wing voices and conspiracy theories, that’s because it probably is. It’s not exactly a coordinated effort by Musk’s lieutenants to push your views to the right. It’s just how X is designed these days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s way too soon to tell just how big a role X played in Trump’s reelection. We also don’t know what, if anything, Musk will do differently with the platform as he eyes <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-adopt-musks-proposal-government-efficiency-commission-wsj-reports-2024-09-05/">some sort of role</a> in the new administration. You can count on continuing to question everything you see on social media, though.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The problem will get worse because there are no guardrails in place right now,” said Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “All the trends are moving in the wrong direction.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, thanks to the apathy of social media platforms <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/12/17/ai-fake-news-misinformation/">and the rise of AI</a>, lying on the internet <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/353958/online-lies-invisible-rulers-book-successful-misinformation">has never been easier</a>. And if you’re on X, it’s part of the appeal.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The right will continue to rule X</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leading up to the election, opinions on the fate of X were grim. There were <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-twitter-misinformation-timeline-1235076786/">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2dpj485nno">of</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/misinformation/musk-election-misinformation-x-officials-twitter-voting-rcna176938">reports</a> on the dangers of election misinformation on the platform or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285681/x-elon-musk-everything-app-bank-fail">Musk’s broken promises</a> about what X would do by now. Bloomberg columnist Dave Lee argued that the platform was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-08-14/musk-s-x-reeks-of-failing-social-network-syndrome?sref=qYiz2hd0">simply failing</a>, losing users and relevance. That seems less likely now.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite <a href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/twitter-x-usage-sees-sharp-decline/">rumors of its demise</a>, X is still quite big. X told advertisers as recently as September that it has <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/x-claims-to-advertisers-that-it-has-a-reach-of-570-million-monthly-active-users/">over 570 million monthly active users</a>, dwarfing right-wing platforms like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/technology/truth-social-right-wing-apps.html">Truth Social</a> and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/02/why-rumble-is-the-only-successful-right-wing-social-platform.html">Rumble</a>, whose users are in the hundreds of thousands. It is also much bigger than platforms <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12613">like Mastodon and Blue Sky</a>, which progressives fled to after Musk bought Twitter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Meta recently said its Twitter-replacement platform, Threads, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/threads-users-how-many-meta-twitter-instagram-2024-11">has 275 million monthly active users</a>. A big difference between the two? Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/9/24067742/instagram-threads-meta-political-content-recommended-feeds">limits</a> the amount of political content you see on Threads. It looks like people are either staying on X or flocking to it for unfiltered politics news.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political news on Twitter <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/07/09/our-study-found-little-evidence-that-twitter-is-biased-against-conservative-opinion-leaders/">used to be marginal</a>, where celebrities were the main draw. The celebrities <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/shonda-rhimes-celebrities-leave-twitter-elon-musk-takeover-social-media-2022-10">have left</a>, and now X is the most popular major social media platform for keeping up with politics, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/06/12/how-americans-navigate-politics-on-tiktok-x-facebook-and-instagram/">Pew survey</a> published in June. There has also been a major partisan shift. Democrats historically dominated political discussion on the platform, but X has become <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/">dominated by right-wing voices</a> in just the last couple of years. Posts from Republicans are far more likely to go viral on X, and once-popular Democrat accounts have seen their audiences disintegrate, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/29/elon-musk-x-republican-democrat-twitter-election/">a recent Washington Post investigation</a>.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2176089209.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Elon Musk, onstage with Trump at a rally, jumps in the sir with his arms over his head." title="Elon Musk, onstage with Trump at a rally, jumps in the sir with his arms over his head." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Elon Musk jumped onstage at an  October 5 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and became a meme in the process. | Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have also changed their minds about the platform’s impact on democracy. While Twitter was once <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/the-cover-up-big-tech-the-swamp-and-mainstream-media-coordinated-to-censor-americans-free-speech-%EF%BF%BC/'">framed</a> as the platform that censored conservative voices, X has become the right’s favorite place for freedom. Only 17 percent of Republicans thought Twitter was good for democracy in 2021, but 53 percent said X was good for democracy in 2024, according to the Pew study.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Democratic users are much more likely to think people getting harassed is a major problem on the platform, and on the flip side, Republicans who post about politics are especially likely to do so because their views feel welcome there,” Colleen McClain, one of the authors of the Pew study, told me this week. McClain added that “in recent years, we haven&#8217;t seen any mass exodus or flocking to or from X in our data, either overall or by party.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this should come as a huge surprise if you’ve spent any time on X. But the partisan split took on new dimensions leading up to this year’s election, if only because the Republicans who felt like their voices were heard on X also felt heard at the ballot box.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their guy won, and maybe <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-far-right-supporters-violent-memes/">the weird, violent memes on X</a> helped.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Elon Musk is just getting started</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don’t know if X will grow or change — or just stay its same problematic self — as Trump prepares to take office again. We do know Musk isn’t done with politics. Musk was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/elon-musk-trump-election-night.html">at Trump’s side</a> at Mar-a-Lago as the results rolled in on election night, and there’s good reason to believe we’ll see the SpaceX owner in DC soon enough.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As far as politics go, Musk says <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/11/06/elon-musk-trump-victory/">he’s not done funding political races</a>. In a livestream on X, Musk said his America PAC would “keep going after this election, and prepare for the midterms and any intermediate elections.” Trump, meanwhile, said in his victory speech, “We have a new star. A star is born — Elon!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In September, Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/trump-vows-15-corporate-tax-and-taps-musk-for-federal-audit?sref=qYiz2hd0">promised Musk a role</a> heading up a task force to review federal expenditures, one that would make “drastic reforms” to the federal government. This makes sense because Musk had been the one who pitched the idea for such a task force to the president-elect. Trump even <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-musk-secretary-of-cost-cutting-1235132825/">suggested a new job title</a>, “Secretary of Cost Cutting,” while Musk suggested he&#8217;d be head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which does not exist and whose acronym is a reference to <a href="https://dogecoin.com/">a dog-themed cryptocurrency</a>. Musk later said at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally that he <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-06/what-trump-election-means-for-elon-musk-tesla-tsla-and-spacex?sref=qYiz2hd0">wanted to cut $2 trillion</a> from the federal budget, which would be very difficult.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s easy, however, to see how Musk’s many companies <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/06/2024/elon-musk-is-techs-big-winner-in-the-us-election">stand to benefit immensely</a> from a close relationship with the Trump administration. SpaceX is already one of NASA’s primary contractors, pulling in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/26/spacex-wins-nasa-contract-for-iss-reentry-destruction.html">hundreds of millions</a> if not <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/nasa-awards-spacex-more-crew-flights-to-space-station/">several billions of dollars</a> with every contract. Musk’s contact with Vladimir Putin <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/musk-putin-secret-conversations-37e1c187">reportedly put these contracts in jeopardy</a>, although knowing what we know about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-putin-talked-many-7-2021-new-book-claims-rcna174528">Trump’s affinity</a> for the Russian autocrat, the president-elect might not mind this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tesla also stands to benefit, which explains why the company’s stock soared after Trump’s victory was secured. The EV company wants to roll out a massive fleet of robotaxis, a tall order that comes with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-promises-paid-robotaxis-next-year-significant-hurdles-remain-2024-10-24/">significant regulatory challenges</a>. Tesla’s self-driving car program in general has faced pushback from federal authorities, including a recently announced <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/business/tesla-self-driving-investigation.html">investigation into the system</a>. Regulatory approval and investigations can be easier, of course, if you bankrolled the president’s final push to reelection.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk’s bet on developing artificial general intelligence, xAI, can also look forward to more cooperation from the federal government. The second Trump administration could pave the way for xAI to get access to cheap energy, especially as it faces heat <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/musks-xai-operating-gas-turbines-without-permits-data-center-environmental-group-2024-08-28/">for running gas generators without permits</a> to power its data center in Memphis.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-1244262469.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.8035109331691,100,92.392978133662" alt="Elon Musk carries a bathroom sink into Twitter headquarters." title="Elon Musk carries a bathroom sink into Twitter headquarters." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The image of Elon Musk carrying a sink won laughs online but did not endear the billionaire to his new employees at Twitter. | Twitter/AFP/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Twitter/AFP/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">On top of these lucrative potential deals, the idea that X might win new relevance and influence must feel like a bonus to Musk.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For its right-wing users, though, X is finally the digital town square they were promised so many months ago. It seems like just yesterday, Musk was carrying a sink into Twitter’s headquarters on his first day as the company’s owner. (“Let that sink in” is supposed to be the joke there.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk paid tribute to that post on X just after midnight on election night. Except this time, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1854034776815972649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854034776815972649%7Ctwgr%5E3f290c51ad8b92a6fcfa382339e553573cafc99c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moneycontrol.com%2Fnews%2Fworld%2Flet-that-sink-in-as-trump-gains-elon-musk-posts-iconic-throwback-picture-with-oval-office-background-12859253.html">in a doctored photo</a>, he was carrying a sink into the Oval Office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump is once again the president-elect of the United States, a development that promises to profoundly affect the world order.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first term in office, from 2017 to 2021, Trump’s foreign policy was protectionist and transactional; he cast doubt on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/5/8/17328520/iran-nuclear-deal-trump-withdraw">utility of alliances</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/28/17513972/trump-nato-russia-putin-nafta">alienated partners</a>, and attempted <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2019/2/26/18239694/trump-north-korea-kim-jong-un-vietnam-summit">complex diplomacy on his own</a>. At times, Trump’s methods <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/28/17513972/trump-nato-russia-putin-nafta">strained US relationships</a>, and made the US the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/25/17900980/un-trump-laughed-at">target of ridicule</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was clear throughout his campaign that a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">second term would feature the same approach</a>, threatening to impose sweeping <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/trumps-new-tariff-proposal-could-cost-americans-78-bln-annual-spending-nrf-study-2024-11-04/">new tariffs</a> (even on allies), suggesting changes to how the US works with NATO, and promising a <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/post/41800">rapid end to the war in Ukraine</a>.&nbsp;Ahead of his election, reports suggested <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3gr90jnxjvo">some US allies were worried</a> about a Trump win. Now that he is headed back to the White House, world leaders from across the political spectrum have had a range of reactions from firm enthusiasm, to muted optimism, to silence. Here’s what they’ve had to say.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A range of responses in conflict zones</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was one of the first world leaders to offer Trump hearty congratulations for his “historic” return to the presidency. Trump’s win “offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,” <a href="https://twitter.com/netanyahu/status/1854070348926328965">Netanyahu wrote on the social media site X</a>. “This is a huge victory!”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Netanyahu and Trump enjoyed a close relationship during Trump’s first term, and they have much in common; they are both nationalists, and have both faced significant legal obstacles to their leadership. <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/383152/donald-trump-criminal-indictments-supreme-court-reelected">Trump is a convicted felon</a>, and Netanyahu has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/world/netanyahu-corruption-trial-resumes/index.html">thus far successfully avoided conviction on corruption charges</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As president, Trump moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a symbolic move that tacitly affirmed the contested city as Israel’s, and pushed Arab countries to normalize ties with Israel through the Abraham Accords. Under a second Trump administration, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/israels-rightist-government-celebrates-trump-claims-victory-2024-11-06/">support for Israel and Netanyahu is likely to increase</a>; though he has called for a conclusion to the war in Gaza (which the Biden administration has financially and diplomatically supported) he has also given Netanyahu a green light to “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/25/trump-netanyahu-support-gaza-lebanon/">do what you have to do</a>” in Gaza and implied <a href="https://time.com/6972021/donald-trump-2024-election-interview/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiossneakpeek&amp;stream=top">he no longer believes in a two-state solution</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump does not have the same warm relationship with Palestinian leaders, who were more measured in their statements. Palestinian Authority head Mahmoud Abbas <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/live-blog/live-blog-update/president-abbas-congratulates-president-trump-winning-us-presidential?fid=537046&amp;nid=405861&amp;topic=Israel%2527s%2520war%2520on%2520Gaza">congratulated Trump in a statement</a>, saying, “we are confident that the United States will support, under your leadership, the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people.” Hamas leaders were much more circumspect, saying, “Our position on the new US administration depends on its positions and practical behavior towards our Palestinian people, their legitimate rights and their just cause.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ukraine also has deep military ties to the US at the moment; the US has been Ukraine’s largest security backer by far as the country continues its nearly three-year-long fight against Russia’s full-scale invasion. Ukrainian President <a href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1854073411904938032">Volodymyr Zelenskyy</a> offered his congratulations and made clear his hopes for the second Trump term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I appreciate President Trump’s commitment to the ‘peace through strength’ approach in global affairs,” Zelenskyy wrote on X. “This is exactly the principle that can practically bring just peace in Ukraine closer. I am hopeful that we will put it into action together.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Measured, but optimistic responses from allies</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other allies, particularly in Europe, offered a range of cautiously optimistic responses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4976102-nato-mark-rutte-donald-trump-2024-election-win/">NATO’s new chief Mark Rutte</a> said he would work alongside Trump to “advance peace through strength through NATO.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s attitude toward the alliance —&nbsp;as with international affairs more broadly —&nbsp;is highly transactional. In his first term, he regularly disparaged the security alliance, complained that European nations were not contributing enough financially, and pulled nearly a third of US troops out of Germany at the end of his presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Trump&#8217;s criticism all along has been that America&#8217;s friends, partners, and allies free ride on its security guarantee and steal jobs from the United States,” <a href="https://www.cfr.org/expert/james-m-lindsay">James M. Lindsay</a>, a senior fellow in US foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">European leaders like centrist French President Emmanuel Macron, center-left British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and right-wing Italian President Giorgia Meloni all congratulated Trump and expressed their desire to enhance the trans-Atlantic partnership under a second term, as did European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, those desires may be tested by a tariff plan Trump has floated. He’s expressed a willingness to enact tariffs of as much as 20 percent from most trading partners, including friendly nations. Anticipating a Trump victory, European Union leaders have tried to <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-trade-war-donald-trump-elections-triumphs-board-tariffs-transatlantic-relations/">prepare by proposing retaliatory tariffs on US imports</a>. The <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/worlds-largest-trade-and-investment-relationship-hangs-balance">US is the EU’s largest trading partner</a>, and the bloc’s economy took a hit when Trump imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum during his first term.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>US adversaries stay silent</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">US adversaries China and Russia have had less to say about Trump’s victory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Russian President Vladimir Putin, who Trump has praised in the past, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-medvedev-says-trump-presidency-would-be-blow-ukraine-2024-11-06/">has not publicly congratulated Trump</a>, nor has <a href="https://fortune.com/asia/2024/11/06/china-says-it-hopes-for-peaceful-coexistence-with-u-s-as-trump-clinches-win/">Chinese President Xi Jinping</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-medvedev-says-trump-presidency-would-be-blow-ukraine-2024-11-06/">suggested on Wednesday that</a> official congratulations weren’t likely to be forthcoming, saying, “we are talking about an unfriendly country, which is both directly and indirectly involved in a war against our state,” referring to US support for Ukraine. Trump has said that he would bring a stop to Russia’s war in Ukraine within a 24-hour period, without discussing how that would be possible. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though there are some indications that Russia and Ukraine might come to the negotiating table, Peskov was circumspect about the US’s role in making that happen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have repeatedly said that the US is able to contribute to the end of this conflict,” he said.&nbsp;“Will this happen, and if so, how &#8230; we will see after January,” when Trump takes office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Xi has not publicly congratulated Trump either. Trump <a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2018/september/ustr-finalizes-tariffs-200">slapped China with massive tariffs in 2018</a>, and threatened 60 percent tariffs on Chinese imports during a second term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We will continue to approach and handle China-US relations based on the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/china-says-hopes-for-peaceful-coexistence-with-us-as-trump-on-brink-of-victory-673c3d3f">Mao Ning said during a Wednesday press conference</a>. When asked if Xi would call Trump to congratulate him on the win, she said the ministry would “handle related matters in accordance with usual practice” following the official announcement of election results. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/11/05/compare-2020-2024-presidential-results/">red shift in 2024 was so broad</a> that no one localized issue appeared to tip the election in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">President-elect Donald Trump’s favor</a>. However, one key factor may have been voters’ widespread dissatisfaction with the economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Enduring pessimism about the US economy has puzzled political analysts, given that most <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-kamala-harris-policies-how-strong-is-the-economy-election/">major indicators suggest it is strong</a> and that the US has recovered <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-recovery-from-covid-19-in-international-comparison/#:~:text=A%20combination%20of%20unprecedented%20fiscal,now%20entering%20its%20fourth%20year.">better than other countries</a> from a pandemic-induced slump. Inflation has <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-">come down significantly</a> from its peak in June 2022, slowing price hikes for basic goods. The Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates, making borrowing money cheaper. The economy has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/economy/us-gdp-economy-third-quarter-2024-59bf100b">continued to grow at a solid rate</a>. Unemployment <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2023/02/news-unemployment-its-lowest-level-54-years">dipped to its lowest level in 54 years</a> in 2023 and stayed within a desirable range.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On paper, everything looked great. But in <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx">poll</a> after <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/30/us/elections/trump-harris-economy-poll.html">poll</a> ahead of the election, voters signaled concern for the economy and ranked inflation as their top issue. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/05/us/politics/exit-polls-election.html?unlocked_article_code=1.X04.ZwKX.5orIonRhVE1e&amp;smid=url-share">rough, preliminary voting data</a> available in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nbc-news-exit-poll-voters-express-concern-democracy-economy-rcna178602" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/nbc-news-exit-poll-voters-express-concern-democracy-economy-rcna178602">exit polling</a> showed the same trend.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the heart of that disconnect might be elements that broad economic indicators often struggle to capture: Despite a “strong economy,” many Americans continued to feel the burden of higher prices, struggled to find work, and took on more debt. And the Election Day results suggest they blamed Democrats — specifically President Joe Biden and Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris — for those problems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23815490/joe-biden-economy-bidenomics-jobs-inflation-2024-election">rosy portraits of the economy embraced by Democrats</a> may have missed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There was a real inflation backlash</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though inflation is now down to 2.4 percent from its post-pandemic high of 9.1 percent, it’s been clear for months that Americans are still hurting financially and psychologically.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wage growth has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/business/economy/inflation-wages-pay-salaries.html#:~:text=The%20various%20data%20sources%20agree,for%20more%20than%20two%20years.">caught up with inflation</a> on average. But wage gains haven’t been uniform: The lowest-paid workers saw some of the biggest gains, particularly in the leisure and hospitality sectors, but other industries, from advertising to chemical manufacturing, saw their wages decline relative to inflation. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/x7ic1-overall-wage-growth-has-outpaced-inflation-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,14.639724417981,100,70.720551164037" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Nicole Narea/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if workers received raises that outpaced inflation, that doesn’t help with sticker shock. Research has shown that consumers have an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/01/business/inflation-reference-price-food.html">internalized “reference price”</a> — a conception of what constitutes a fair price for a good they routinely purchase. If that imagined price doesn’t match up with reality, consumers feel short-changed. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though a person’s reference price can change, it usually does so slowly, following the normal pace of inflation (roughly 2 percent per year). Consumers haven’t had much time to adjust amid rapid inflation in recent years. That causes them to overestimate inflation: An August YouGov poll found that most <a href="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50358-kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-election-democratic-convention-inflation-israel-hamas-russia-ukraine-august-17-20-2024-economist-yougov-poll" data-type="link" data-id="https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/50358-kamala-harris-donald-trump-2024-election-democratic-convention-inflation-israel-hamas-russia-ukraine-august-17-20-2024-economist-yougov-poll">consumers think inflation is significantly higher</a> than it actually is. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consumers also often <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2022/04/18/clearing-up-common-misconceptions-about-inflation/">misunderstand how inflation works</a>. The important thing to know is that it only goes one way: When inflation decreases, that just means that prices are increasing less quickly, not that they are going down. (That can happen, though rarely.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prices going down, a phenomenon known as deflation, would be a potentially worrying signal about the health of the economy. If consumers pay less for a good, that can translate to less money to pay the workers who produce and distribute it, leading to less consumer spending overall and slower economic growth.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The job market is tougher</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The days of the pandemic-era “Great Resignation”— when employers struggled to hire and workers had their pick of jobs and the ability to demand higher wages — are well and truly over. The unemployment rate has ticked up in recent months to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html">4.1 percent</a>, and job growth has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html">slowed to levels not seen since 2020</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is still within the realm of what economists would consider low unemployment. But the top-line rate doesn’t tell the full story.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, people are <a href="https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/october-jobs-report-release-today/card/americans-are-staying-unemployed-longer-mqIm7uv9DpczwYkLDdfQ">staying unemployed for longer</a>: 1.6 million Americans were unemployed for a period of at least 27 weeks in October, compared to just 1.3 million the same month last year.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/vKk9Y-more-people-are-facing-long-term-unemployment.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.809066478228,100,66.381867043544" alt="Chart showing the number of people who remained unemployed for 27 weeks or more over the last 8 years." title="Chart showing the number of people who remained unemployed for 27 weeks or more over the last 8 years." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Nicole Narea/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Many workers may also find themselves underemployed, stuck in part-time work or a job that doesn’t require their training or qualifications. This is especially true for recent college graduates, over half of whom were underemployed a year after graduation, according to a <a href="https://www.burningglassinstitute.org/research/underemployment">February report</a> by the Burning Glass Institute and the Strada Institute for the Future of Work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some industries are also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/01/us-jobs-report-october-2024.html">cutting jobs</a>. That includes jobs in manufacturing and temporary help services, which have decreased by 577,000 since March 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The overall unemployment rate doesn’t really reflect these nuances, which suggest Americans’ work lives may not be as rosy as the top-line number makes them appear.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Americans have less money and are taking on more debt</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After a brief spike in savings rates during the pandemic due to a series of stimulus checks, <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT">Americans are now saving less</a> than they were pre-pandemic. This creates a cycle where Americans have less money, so they borrow more. Because interest rates have been high, borrowing has become more expensive, leaving them with even less money.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/mZ2kM-americans-are-saving-less-after-the-pandemic.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.907343884777,100,62.185312230447" alt="Chart showing a decrease in savings rates following the pandemic. " title="Chart showing a decrease in savings rates following the pandemic. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Nicole Narea/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans are pulling from their now-depleted savings and amassing debt on credit cards and other revolving credit plans in which consumers can repeatedly borrow money up to a set limit and repay in installments. The total amount of credit card debt in the US reached an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-have-your-credit-card-debt-forgiven-this-november/">all-time high of $1.14 trillion</a> as of October, with individuals owing an average of $8,000.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Credit card delinquency rates have <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS">gone up</a>. Young adults in particular, many of whom are also struggling with high <a href="https://www.vox.com/student-loan-debt">student loan debt</a>, are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/06/credit-card-balances-jump-to-new-1point13-trillion-record-at-end-of-2023.html">increasingly falling behind on their credit card payments</a>. At some point, something has to give.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This might be part of the reason many Americans still yearn for the economy under Trump in 2019, when they had more cash on hand and weren’t staring down so much debt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My older kid knows this was an election week, but his biggest concern has been his school’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/4/16413116/scholastic-book-fair-explained">Scholastic Book Fair</a>. My younger kid, who is 2, does not know what an election is.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is, of course, a privilege to be oblivious to national events, a privilege not every child has — the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/22/what-we-know-about-unauthorized-immigrants-living-in-the-us/">millions of children</a> who live with unauthorized immigrant parents, for example, could be very deeply affected by <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">Trump’s “mass deportation” plan</a> if he’s able to follow through with it. And the outcome of the election will impact the future of all children, in the US and around the world, through its effects on <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/379450/election-2024-climate-stakes-presidential-race">climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/381636/trump-2024-democracy-threat-orban-second-term">American democracy</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/380060/trump-world-risks-war">foreign policy</a>, and more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ll be talking to my kids in the months and years ahead about all these issues. If you’re looking to start having more conversations with the kids in your life about elections and democratic participation, <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/381410/kids-teens-politics-election-misinformation">Vox’s Allie Volpe has tips</a> on how to do that. I especially like her advice to teach children about civic engagement, something that can be easier to do on a local level.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My older kid wrote (okay, he dictated) to New York City Mayor Eric Adams earlier this year to protest proposed cuts to library budgets, and Adams eventually reversed those cuts, thanks in no small part to the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/28/business/nyc-libraries-funding-restored/index.html">more than 174,000 letters</a> he received from concerned New Yorkers. It was a hopeful moment in what has been (at least for adults) a year of enormous <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/379814/election-anxiety-stress-coping-strategies-control-community">political</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/381475/elections-donald-trump-kamala-harris-anxiety-progress-voting">stress</a>. I think my kid felt he could have a real impact on our city, however small (his campaign to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/354457/new-york-congestion-pricing-traffic-big-mistake">reinstate congestion pricing</a> has yet to bear similar fruit).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kids’ lives are often hyperlocal — they are affected most by their families, their schools, their immediate communities. In a way, though, that’s true of all of us — my colleague Marina Bolotnikova recently noted that her technique for managing election anxiety was to “realize how much my quality of life has to do more with state/local policy than national elections and adjust my attention accordingly.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As we all process the results of this week’s election, I’ll be thinking about what my family and I can do on a local scale, and what so many are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/04/nyregion/migrant-family-gofundme.html">already doing</a>, no matter who’s in the White House. I also want to hear from you — have the kids in your life been asking about the election? How are they feeling? How are you talking to them about what’s going on, and about the future? What’s bringing you hope and fear right now?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Get in touch at <a href="mailto:anna.north@vox.com">anna.north@vox.com</a>, and I’ll be back next week.</p>

It’s really amazing,” one eighth-grader <a href="https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2024/11/nj-students-vote-mock-election-president-senator-members-house-representatives/">told NJ Spotlight News</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As kids’ school lunch accounts <a href="https://www.vox.com/life/379082/school-tracking-apps-grades-google-classroom-classdojo">move online</a>, payment processors are charging families fees just to put money into their accounts. Now the USDA is <a href="https://www.k12dive.com/news/usda-school-meal-junk-fees-ban-reduced-price-meals/731741/">moving to ban those fees</a> — but not until the 2027–28 school year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kids are <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2024/11/chat-gen-alpha-teens-slang-twitch-streamers.html">calling each other “chat.”</a> Also, “<a href="https://www.vox.com/life/369953/skibidi-tweens-gen-alpha-brainrot-ipad-kids">Ohio</a>” is over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My younger kid keeps demanding repeat readings of what he calls “raccoon” — actually <a href="https://penguinrandomhouselibrary.com/book/?isbn=9780803739475"><em>Secret Pizza Party</em></a><em>, </em>by the team who brought you <a href="https://www.dragonslovetacos.com/"><em>Dragons Love Tacos</em></a>. <em>SPP</em> is about a raccoon who dresses up like a human to steal pizza, and then there’s a party, and everyone is wearing masks for some reason. Honestly, I don’t understand this one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From my inbox</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Texas reader wrote in that he brought his 7-year-old son to the polls this year. “The biggest deal to him was the election workers who made a big deal about a ‘future voter’ being there,” he said. “Kids generally like getting stickers but he seemed particularly pleased with this one.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“My wife took our youngest daughter this week,” he added. “She seemed similarly pleased with the sticker and the big highlight was her loudly chanting, ‘Washington for president! I want Washington for president!’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s an unorthodox suggestion, but one apparently shared by several voters who <a href="https://www.wric.com/news/u-s-world/write-ins-hardly-win-but-these-characters-celeb-and-non-candidates-are-popular-options/">wrote in “George Washington” on their 2020 ballots</a>; other write-in candidates included Mickey Mouse, the Hulk, and “giant meteor.”</p>

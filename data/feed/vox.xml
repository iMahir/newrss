						<p class="has-text-align-none">A key promise in Paris’s bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics was that its famous river, the Seine, would be cleaned up in time to host open water swimming events: the triathlon, paratriathlon, and marathon swimming. But swimming has been banned in the Seine for a century because the Paris sewer system is designed to dump wastewater into the river during heavy rain when the sewers get overwhelmed by stormwater. When that happens, levels of E. coli, a bacteria associated with fecal matter, spike, making the water too contaminated to swim in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To deliver on their promise to clean the river for the Olympics, Paris officials took on a $1.5 billion USD infrastructure project that included a massive underground tank and tunnel system that could hold excess sewage during heavy rain to minimize contamination of the Seine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Paris officials will test water quality daily ahead of the Olympic games. They’re hopeful their ambitious plan to host swimming in the famously polluted river will succeed, but the likelihood of open water swimming taking place will also depend on weather and luck.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t think we have enough hot dogs,” Julianne Moore’s character whispers gloomily in Todd Haynes’s 2023 film <em>May December</em>. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKaHX0LsRTE">scene</a> that quickly became iconic online for how amusingly melodramatic it is also captures, perhaps inadvertently, America’s strange relationship with the oblong food. <em>Is</em> there such a thing as having enough hot dogs? As a culture, the answer seems to be no. The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council estimates that we eat somewhere in the region of <a href="https://www.hot-dog.org/culture/hot-dog-fast-facts">20 billion hot dogs</a> every year, or about 70 per person. (Hot dog eating contest champion Joey Chestnut once downed a record 76 in 10 minutes.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The hot dog’s popularity isn’t exactly surprising. It’s an undemanding food, coming to you precooked and ready to eat. It’s so easy to make that a child could do it, and indeed many of us did as kids. During the Covid lockdown, when other people had their hot girl walks, I entered my hot dog era, eating nothing else for a week straight in the stifling kitchen of my apartment. It turned out that I wasn’t alone: In March 2020, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/hot-dog-classic-american-summer-food/index.html">hot dog sales were already up by 127 percent</a> for the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We saw, during the pandemic, pretty large spikes in hotdog consumption,” says Eric Mittenthal, president of the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council. “Particularly as families were stuck at home, they wanted something easy and convenient to make.” According to Nielsen data, about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210223130356/https://www.hot-dog.org/media/consumption-stats">944 million pounds of hot dogs</a> were sold at grocery stores in 2020 — last year, about <a href="https://www.hot-dog.org/media/consumption-stats">896 million pounds</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re looking for cheap and easy, few foods fit the bill as well as the hot dog. Yet despite the hot dog’s affordability and popularity, it’s also undeniably a <em>weird</em> food. For one, the habits around when and how they’re typically consumed are pretty limited; they’re not your usual lunch or dinner time consideration the way a sandwich or delivery pizza might be. We tend to make them at home for backyard barbecues, or as an easy meal for kids, or eat them when we’re out, but they’re more closely associated with ballparks and beaches than restaurants. For all their ubiquity and easy consumability — you can easily down a hot dog with one hand — they can also be somewhat tricky for meat manufacturers and restaurants to sell because there’s perennial wariness over the quality of the mystery meat. A hot dog might be a quintessential American food, but it’s also the quintessential odd food — in origin, the way it’s made, the way we talk about it, even its very shape. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How hot dogs got so hot</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re a hot dog lover, thank the German immigrants who came to the US in huge waves <a href="https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/immigration/german/new-surge-of-growth/">in the 19th century</a>, porting over their love of sausages and beer gardens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It originated as a home food among Germans, and then went to the street, where it became commodified as a cheap product to be eaten on the run by immigrants,” says Bruce Kraig, a historian who has written two books about <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/H/bo6899754.html">the culinary</a> and <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/man-bites-dog-bruce-kraig/1111422336">cultural history</a> of the hot dog. “It’s kind of poor folks’ food.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Street food itself boomed with the rise of public amusement and leisure as more Americans got <a href="https://www.loc.gov/collections/america-at-work-and-leisure-1894-to-1915/articles-and-essays/america-at-leisure/">time away from constantly working</a>, a novel phenomenon. Top among public amusements: baseball games and seaside boardwalks, like Asbury Park in New Jersey. Early vendors were mostly poor immigrants selling the bun-and-wiener combo for a nickel a pop, and hot dogs were such a hit because they were relatively cheap to both buy and sell. As hot dog carts popped up coast to coast in the early 20th century, a few lucky enterprising souls struck it rich from their hot dog business — like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/03/25/archives/handwerker-of-nathans-famous-dies-turned-his-coney-island-hot-dogs.html">Nathan Handwerker</a>, founder of the Nathan’s Famous hot dog chain that crowds flock to on Coney Island to this day.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Almost 40 percent of the billions of hot dogs consumed in the US every year are eaten between Memorial Day and Labor Day</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thanks to its association with leisure — specifically, being out and about in warm weather — hot dogs also became indelibly associated with the summertime. Today, <a href="https://www.10news.com/life/food-and-drink/7-billion-hot-dogs-expected-to-be-consumed-by-americans-this-summer">almost 40 percent</a> of the billions of hot dogs consumed in the US every year are eaten between Memorial Day and Labor Day. (Hot dog sales at baseball games don’t make up as much of total sales as one might think: only about 20 million per year, according to the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the, ahem, big dogs of the industry — billion-dollar companies often owned by even larger food conglomerates — business has been pretty good the last few years. In 2021 especially, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/blog/2021/12/10/recent-data-show-dominant-meat-processing-companies-are-taking-advantage-of-market-power-to-raise-prices-and-grow-profit-margins/">profit margins</a> in the meat processing industry jumped as companies raised prices. Tyson Foods, which owns the popular Ball Park Franks hot dog brand, made a <a href="https://ir.tyson.com/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/TSN-2021-10K-DRAFT-11.12.21.pdf">whopping $1.46 billion</a><strong> </strong>profit in just their prepared foods category (which includes deli meat and hot dogs) in 2021, compared to $743 million in 2020 and <a href="https://ir.tyson.com/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/TSN-2022-10K-FINAL.pdf">$746 million</a> in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In popular culture, hot dogs often communicate some kind of absurdity. (See: the viral<em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLfAf8oHrMo">I Think You Should Leave</a></em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLfAf8oHrMo"> sketch</a>.) A recent TikTok trend asked people what they would yell if they were a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/If-you-were-selling-hot-dogs">hot dog hawker</a> at a baseball game; since 2020 there’s been an uptick in people who aren’t from Washington, DC, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/memes/glizzy-meaning/">calling hot dogs “glizzies”</a> all over social media. There’s also a <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/costco-hot-dog">long-running</a> <a href="https://x.com/sorry_hat/status/1805582933077499919">online obsession</a> <a href="https://x.com/Very__Regular/status/1614630657912700930">with the dirt cheap</a> <a href="https://x.com/MorningBrew/status/1750241804513927341">Costco hot dogs</a>, a dependable go-to in an economy that feels more topsy turvy every day — you can even buy a Costco hot dog <a href="https://x.com/costcodogsol">memecoin</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The double-edged sword of being cheap</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Costco, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/27/economy/costco-hot-dog-inflation/index.html">hot dog and drink combo is still $1.50</a>, a price that has not budged since 1985. (Sam’s Club has its <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-17/sam-s-club-hot-dog-meal-was-opening-salvo-in-war-with-costco?embedded-checkout=true">own rival cheap hot dog</a>.) Hot dogs remain pretty affordable compared to other meal options — but at other places, they weren’t immune to inflation. Prices for frankfurters went up <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf?mod=article_inline">7.3 percent </a>from May 2023 to May 2024. A basic hot dog at Nathan’s is now $5.99 on Coney Island. Pushcart vendors inside New York City parks aren’t allowed to charge <a href="https://www.nycgovparks.org/opportunities/concessions/pushcart-prices">more than $4 per hot dog</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re making them at home or bringing them to someone’s backyard cookout, though, they’re a pretty good deal: According to the latest available Consumer Price Index data on frankfurters, the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/APU0000705111">average price per pound</a> in April 2022 was $5.22. At Walmart, some Oscar Mayer beef franks are $4.19 per pound, but there’s also an eight-pack of Bar S brand hot dogs available for just $1.18, at the time of writing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s nice to have an inexpensive food option when grocery and restaurant prices have shot up, but being too cheap also fuels the concern that people have always had about the food. What’s in that meat?&nbsp; Maybe you <em>don’t</em> actually want the cheapest wiener money can buy. “Hot dogs have always been suspicious in the American mind,” says Kraig. In the early 19th century, Kraig reports in his book, Americans would joke about all kinds of ingredients — rats, stray dogs, feces — making it into the meat grinder. One <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hot-dog-horror-show-survey-finds-americans-are-scared-to-find-out-what-is-in-their-hot-dogs-300652501.html">2018 consumer survey</a> from Applegate (which promotes its uncured hot dogs as cleaner and higher quality), claimed that 43 percent of respondents were “scared” to know what was in hot dogs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think there was a moment for fancy hot dogs,” says Soleil Ho, a food writer and cultural critic at the San Francisco Chronicle. Attempts to <a href="https://www.eatthis.com/most-expensive-hot-dogs-in-america/">elevate the humble frankfurter</a> include a $29 version at Manhattan’s Mischa that came with a whole host of sauces and toppings you could adorn your sausage with, including <a href="https://www.grubstreet.com/2023/08/mischa-29-dollar-hot-dog-should-cost-more.html">kimchi and pimento cheese</a>, that Eater critic <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2023/5/18/23725514/mischa-alex-stupak-midtown-first-look">Robert Sietsema reluctantly adored</a>. (Unfortunately, the restaurant closed down earlier this year.) But they’ve mostly gone the way of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-rise-and-fall-of-cupcake-business-2013-4">fancy cupcake craze</a> of the early 2000s.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The weird way we consume hot dogs</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s something unusually specific about the occasions where it’s normal to have a hot dog: at someone’s backyard cookout, at sports games, at an airport, on a first-time trip to the Big Apple (but only from a street cart), at the movie theater if you’re feeling a little freaky, before or after an exhausting shopping trip at Costco, or perhaps during a hot dog eating contest. You probably wouldn’t go to a fast-casual restaurant, or even most fast-food chains, and decide to have a hot dog on a whim after you browse the menu.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hamburgers, on the other hand, were actively promoted as a hearty option Americans might regularly want to eat, thanks to McDonald’s and other burger chains popping up along the vast, newly built US highway system after World War II. “Hamburger culture spread all over the place,” says Kraig. The burger was thought of as a more meaty meal, while a hot dog was more about fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kraig notes that several chains have certainly tried to sell hot dogs, but “they’ve never quite made it.” Established chains, including Burger King and McDonald’s, have tried offering hot dogs once upon a time, only to discontinue them because they <a href="https://www.mashed.com/261440/this-is-why-burger-king-hot-dogs-were-a-major-flop/">weren’t very popular</a> or because the mystery meat was deemed <a href="https://ktla.com/news/mcfails-a-look-back-at-mcdonalds-menu-items-that-didnt-last/">too low-quality</a> even for fast food. Carl’s Jr. actually started as a hot dog stand, but now is more known for its burgers and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sckyo3-f2D8">overtly sexual ads</a>; it doesn’t even have hot dogs on its menu anymore.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Burger King and McDonald’s have tried offering hot dogs, only to discontinue them because they weren’t very popular</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The closest thing we might have to a national hot dog chain is Nathan’s Famous, but it only has <a href="https://nathansfamous.gcs-web.com/static-files/e3602228-5bc3-4dd5-8f92-bd45e96598a0">230 franchise locations</a> across 17 US states, with a large portion of locations in New York, New Jersey, and Florida (there are none in California). Its hot dogs are also available in a few other countries, including at Ukrainian gas stations. It also now sells wings, burgers, milkshakes, and more, branching out far beyond frankfurters. These storefronts aren’t the main way the company makes money, either — a huge portion of its revenue comes from licensing its brand of sausages to other establishments with hot dogs on their menus (like casinos, amusements parks, sports games), or by selling Nathan’s brand wieners in grocery stores. Its revenue from restaurants in 2024 was just $5.4 million, while its total sales were $138.6 million.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to street vendors, Americans’ tastes have moved on to other, newer meals immigrants have brought to the country, whether that’s a taco truck or a halal cart. And that’s when you can find street food at all: Big cities, including <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-24/san-francisco-targets-hot-dog-stands-homeless-people-in-apec-crackdown">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-street-vendors-targeted-for-lack-of-licenses-despite-city-hall-promising-otherwise">New York</a>, have been shutting down or imposing penalties on street vendors, often for not having proper licenses that can be <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/nyregion/street-vendors-permits-nyc.html">extremely expensive</a> and difficult to obtain.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such independent sellers helped build the hot dog’s huge presence in American culinary tradition — vendors in various parts of the country would put their own spin on the fast food staple, turning it from just a sad-looking cylinder of reddish-brown sausage in a squished bun to something delightfully weird. The Chicago dog, for example, is stuffed to the gills with tomato slices, a whole dill pickle, chopped onions, and relish, all on a poppy seed bun and, crucially, no ketchup. In New Jersey, there’s a <a href="https://www.ruttshut.com/">famous deep-fried hot dog</a> that looks like a delicious heart attack. People tend to have strong feelings about their regional hot dog style — or even about newer <a href="https://japadog.com/menu">fusion styles</a> — which also helps explain why there isn’t a national chain selling a standard hot dog to Americans everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I feel like most people don’t go out for hot dogs,” says Ho. “It’s like going out for a simple bowl of rice or a piece of toast.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that there isn’t a big hot dog chain may be part of the meal’s charm. It still evokes memories of an individual selling them out of their humble cart, or a family member grilling them in the backyard, or a cheap snack offered to tired shoppers that Costco doesn’t seem to mind <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/27/economy/costco-hot-dog-inflation/index.html">taking a loss on</a>. It’s this ultra-processed, mass-produced food that’s nevertheless steeped in domestic nostalgia. At the same time, the hot dog is a little bit — well, maybe more than a little bit — gross. You’re drawn to its perfect portion size, its one-handed portability, but the imagination conjures images of the sharp blades of a filthy, terrifying meat grinder. The mind resists getting too close to the inscrutable hot dog’s true nature.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans are <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-usa">eating more meat than ever</a>, but livestock giants still see plenty of room to grow. As pressure mounts for meat producers to improve their treatment of animals and environmental footprints, they’re turning to a tried-and-true strategy — used in the past by the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/3/21/8267049/merchants-of-doubt">tobacco and oil industries</a> — to expand their markets and shore up the public’s trust in their products: funding favorable research from university scientists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, the National Pork Board, a pork marketing group sponsored by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), funded a nearly $8.5 million program in partnership with researchers from Iowa State University, the University of Georgia, the University of Minnesota, North Carolina State University, and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University to research popular perceptions of the pork industry and improve its reputation, according to federal <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f13ca3e0d7b7a5d4bf7abc8/t/65da7fa3688e982d508a23a1/1708818344236/Real+Pork+Consortium+Proposal.pdf">records</a> obtained by <a href="https://www.vox.com/23906572/crystal-heath-veterinarian-medicine-factory-farming-ventilation-shutdown-future-perfect-50-2023">Crystal Heath</a>, a veterinarian and founder of animal advocacy nonprofit Our Honor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The project, called the Real Pork Trust Consortium, aims to counter “consumer misperceptions of pork production practices,” including about its impacts on animals and the environment, a grant proposal obtained by Heath states. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The grant proposal, reproduced below, notes that some consumers, like those in coastal states, hold more negative views of the pork industry and that “by analyzing the traits and tendencies of these specific groups, we can create targeted communication strategies which influence consumers’ knowledge and understanding of pork production methods, inform decision-making related to political activity, and encourage pork consumption across diverse consumer groups.” Researchers will create communications to share with consumers, with the aim of improving trust in the industry and “ensuring its social license to operate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Heath questions why it should be the job of university researchers to protect the reputation of pork producers. The industry has “enlisted university faculty to serve in its public relations apparatus,” hoping to use researchers’ credibility to prop up an industry that has been implicated in animal cruelty, zoonotic disease risk, and environmental harms, she told Vox in an email. “It’s sort of like increasing public trust in coal mining-based energy production, lead-based paint manufacturing, leaded fuel-dependent transportation, asbestos-dependent construction methods, or DDT-based pest control.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Pork Board (NPB) did not respond to requests for comment. Lead researcher Nicholas Gabler, a professor in Iowa State University’s animal science department, did not respond to Vox’s request for comment but <a href="https://www.feedstuffs.com/agribusiness-news/real-pork-trust-consortium-works-to-resolve-gaps-in-understanding-of-pork">stated</a> in a recent interview with the animal agriculture trade publication Feedstuffs that the consortium is “not a marketing program. It is a science-driven program for understanding how we can communicate better” to improve trust between pork producers and consumers.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Real Pork Trust Consortium is far from the only partnership between meat producers and universities. Close collaboration between the meat industry and academic scientists stretches back to the early days of land-grant universities in the US, when researchers were enlisted to boost the productivity of agriculture in the rapidly growing nation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, some of these partnerships have shifted to focus on contemporary challenges like addressing animal agriculture’s outsize contribution to climate change. But land-grant universities’ original mandate to serve the interests of the agriculture industry<strong> </strong>is colliding with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">clear calls from climate scientists about the need to scale down</a> the livestock industry to meet climate targets and minimize risks to public health and animal welfare.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To mitigate their emissions, meat and dairy companies are pinning their hopes on a suite of technological solutions including adding <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14062022/cow-seaweed-methane/">seaweed to cattle feed</a> or <a href="https://grist.org/agriculture/biogas-boom-ira-incentives/">implementing manure digesters</a>: massive pools meant to capture methane from livestock poop, for use as a fuel source. These practices do shave off emissions, but in many cases they’re difficult to scale, and their potential to mitigate the carbon footprint of highly emitting industries like beef and dairy is overstated. Climate scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02409-7#:~:text=By%202050%2C%20dietary%20changes%20could,people%20ate%20less%20meat%3F')">agree</a> that they have to be accompanied by reductions in livestock production and shifting diets to eat less meat and dairy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the livestock industry has its own scientists, in some cases, emissions-reduction research is carried out by public, land-grant universities, like the University of California Davis, University of Nebraska, Colorado State University, Texas A&amp;M, and others. As with the Real Pork Trust Consortium, animal science programs at these institutions are sometimes funded with millions of dollars in donations from meat and dairy corporations and trade groups and conducted by researchers with ties to industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These partnerships largely prioritize animal agriculture’s continued profitability and can serve to sow doubt about livestock’s role in the climate crisis. Critics say they amount to greenwashing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The animal agriculture industry is now involved in multiple multimillion-dollar efforts with universities to obstruct unfavorable policies as well as influence climate change policy and discourse,” wrote <a href="https://law.yale.edu/viveca-morris">Viveca Morris</a>, an environmental lawyer at Yale Law, and <a href="https://jenniferjacquet.com/">Jennifer Jacquet</a>, an expert on corporate influence at the University of Miami, in a sprawling <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03690-w">2024 paper</a> analyzing university-industry partnerships in the livestock sector. “These efforts have downplayed the livestock sector’s contributions to the climate crisis, minimized the need for emission regulations and other policies aimed at internalizing the costs of the industry’s emissions, and promoted industry-led climate ‘solutions’ that maintain production.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The university mission,” they warned, “is at risk when universities allow industries to shape research and fund communications with the appearance of academic independence.” </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Land-grant universities were set up to boost ag productivity</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The close partnership between farmers and America’s public universities dates back to 1862, when the federal <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/morrill-act">Morrill Act</a> allowed states to establish public universities funded by the sale of federal land (much of which had been <a href="https://www.landgrabu.org/">stolen from Native American tribes</a>). That’s why these universities are called “land-grant” institutions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The goal was to provide education in fields that would help Americans build a successful country, including engineering, military science, and agriculture, said <a href="https://www.aplu.org/about-us/who-we-are/staff/steele/">Doug Steele</a>, the vice president of food, agriculture, and natural resources at the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public universities’ relationship with farmers was further formalized in 1914 with the creation of the USDA’s <a href="https://www.nifa.usda.gov/about-nifa/how-we-work/extension/cooperative-extension-history#:~:text=The%20Smith%20Lever%20Act%20formalized,address%20exclusively%20rural%2C%20agricultural%20issues.">Cooperative Extension System</a>, which established university-government partnerships with the goal of increasing farm productivity and profitability and addressing the research needs of rural, farming communities. These programs offered free educational resources to the public and produced research in direct response to questions from farmers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Extension services aimed to help rural people (particularly white landowners) survive the modern world, especially as an economic gap widened between rural and urban communities, said <a href="https://history.missouri.edu/people/deutsch">Chris<strong> </strong>Deutsch</a>, a historian of the meat industry at the University of Missouri. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1920s and ’30s, when crop failures began to prevent American farmers from producing cotton and fruit such as peaches (significant cash crops at the time), extension services stepped in to give farmers another way to make money, said <a href="http://www.rogerhorowitz.com/about-roger.html">Roger Horowitz</a>, a historian of the US food system at the Hagley Museum.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Extension agents became more connected to the meatpacking industry and more interested in encouraging commercial livestock production as an alternative,” Horowitz said. Since livestock was (and still is) mostly fed grass, hay, and grains, which weren’t as hard hit by crop failures, the sector was seen as a viable alternative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After World War II, agriculture and land ownership increasingly consolidated, and the nature of land-grant universities’ relationship with agriculture began to shift away from a focus on individual farmers’ needs toward more industrial and commercial interests.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus began a close partnership between public universities and livestock producers that would eventually lead to the factory farms that exist today: animal production and slaughter operations run in large industrial facilities that resemble factories more than traditional farms and raise far more animals, far more quickly, than any previous agricultural system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public universities, and especially extension services, “were a key part in the creation of the intensive agricultural system that we have, and particularly the animal side &#8230; because of all the myriad problems that emerge from trying to concentrate animals in a singular point,” said Deutsch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jacquet put it even more bluntly: “You don&#8217;t get the industry that we have now without the land-grant institutions.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>“The university mission is at risk when universities allow industries to shape research and fund communications with the appearance of academic independence</em>.”</p><cite>VIVECA MORRIS AND JENNIFER JACQUET</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The livestock sector began to thrive via all kinds of advancements in farming methods made possible by the work of university scientists. Dubbed the “<a href="https://www.asas.org/docs/default-source/midwest/mw2020/publications/footehist.pdf?sfvrsn=59da6c07_0">first great biotechnology</a>” by one researcher, modern <a href="https://extension.umn.edu/dairy-milking-cows/artificial-insemination-cattle">artificial insemination</a> — the process of collecting sperm from a male animal and depositing it in the reproductive organs of a female — arose after work from extension program researchers at Cornell University (one of seven private land-grant universities in the US) and public university faculty at the University of Minnesota, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and others. Today, the technology is ubiquitous across the meat and dairy industries, giving farmers an unprecedented level of control over the reproductive lives of animals and allowing for rapid production speeds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Feed additives developed by public universities supercharged animals’ ability to metabolize food and convert it into body mass, said Deutsch. In the 1950s, for example, Iowa State University researcher <a href="https://isubios.pubpub.org/pub/ljwww8lm/release/1">Wise Burroughs</a> helped develop and patented a feed additive called diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic form of estrogen that led cows to gain weight 12 percent faster while eating 8-10 percent less feed. Iowa State later partnered with feed and pharma giant Eli Lilly to produce the hormone (Eli Lilly has since split from animal-health subsidiary Elanco and now focuses on human health). By the 1970s, it was banned in the US, in part due to its link to cancer in humans. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also in the 1950s, extension programs began to push farmers to use more antibiotics, since they made animals grow faster while requiring less feed, said Horowitz.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Publicly supported scientists affiliated with land-grant universities also contributed much of the early research into poultry genetics, nutrition, and health, propelling the US chicken industry into the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/10/23589333/cecile-steele-chicken-meat-poultry-eggs-delaware">behemoth</a> that it is today. The use of medicated feed and new research into poultry diseases created a booming chicken industry that helped increase American chicken production almost 30-fold in the last century.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Genetics research transformed the chicken from a “backyard scratch, hunt, and peck animal into, essentially, a technology,” said <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Chicken.html?id=iwh3yAEACAAJ">Paul Josephson</a>, an environmental historian at Colby College who has written a book about the history of chickens. High-profile <a href="https://livestock.extension.wisc.edu/articles/the-chicken-of-tomorrow/">contests</a> in the 1940s, resulting from partnerships between the poultry industry and extension programs including at the University of Delaware and the University of Arkansas, sought the “Chicken of Tomorrow,” a breed that would have a larger percentage of breast, leg, and thigh meat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Americans eat more than 9 billion broiler chickens every year — animals that are <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032579119385505">more than four times</a> as massive as a chicken of the 1950s, a transformation that has come at a high cost to animal welfare. Modern chickens <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/17/from-farm-to-factory-the-unstoppable-rise-of-american-chicken">grow so big and so fast</a> that their legs often can’t support the immense weight of their bodies. Research out of public universities made this transformation possible through developments in feed, antibiotics, and genetics. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today’s public universities continue to develop methods that push animals to their biological limits to allow the US to produce ever more animals at higher speed and lower cost. A 2015 New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/dining/animal-welfare-at-risk-in-experiments-for-meat-industry.html">investigation</a>, for example, found that the US Meat Animal Research Center, a cooperative program between the USDA and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, was breeding female pigs and cows to give birth to ever more offspring, leading to mass mortality and severe animal welfare problems. The USDA told the Times that the center follows federal animal welfare rules.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2016, public records <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/04/14/killing-chickens-bird-flu-vsd/">obtained</a> by animal welfare group Animal Outlook revealed that research at North Carolina State University funded by the US Poultry and Egg Association, an industry trade group, played a major role in developing ventilation shutdown: a method used to mass kill chickens and turkeys by trapping them inside barns and pumping in extreme heat. The method kills the animals by heatstroke and is now being used to cull tens of millions of poultry birds to stop the spread of bird flu; it’s been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">criticized</a> as the cruelest culling option.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This type of research is “unethical, particularly &#8230; when the very things you’re doing to increase production are causing harm to animals,” said <a href="https://www.vermontlaw.edu/directory/person/winders-delcianna">Delcianna Winders</a>, an associate professor of animal law at Vermont Law and Graduate School.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Ag industry-aligned researchers want to develop climate solutions without sacrificing growth</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The supercharged growth of the livestock industry has brought huge consequences for the environment, for the public, and for the animals themselves. “It’s ecologically illogical,” said Deutsch. “It shouldn’t be possible to gather a million [animals] into one small contained room and have that be sustainable.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Deutsch said, the livestock industry still depends on university research to maintain conditions where <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">disease thrives</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">ecological issues</a> are rampant, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/9/22967328/animal-cruelty-laws-state-federal-exemptions-pennsylvania-martin-farms-dairy-calves-dehorning">animal welfare violations persist</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meat and dairy production account for <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/novel-meat-and-dairy-alternatives-could-help-curb-climate-harming#:~:text=The%20animal%20agriculture%20industry%20is,cent%20of%20global%20GHG%20emissions.">14-20 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions, while fertilizer and manure runoff from concentrated animal farms has created widespread water quality issues in the US Midwest, <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2021/06/midwest-farm-states-nitrate-pollution-tap-water-more-likely-lower-income">particularly</a> for disadvantaged communities. Forcing animals into crowded spaces also heightens the risk of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/22/21228158/coronavirus-pandemic-risk-factory-farming-meat">zoonotic disease spillover</a> — as we’re seeing now with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety">bird flu infections</a> among US dairy herds and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0522-human-case-h5.html">dairy workers</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, public universities are hard at work assisting the industry in finding sustainability solutions that don’t sacrifice growth. Much of that work surrounds efforts to reduce <a href="https://www.epa.gov/gmi/importance-methane#:~:text=Methane%20is%20the%20second%20most,trapping%20heat%20in%20the%20atmosphere.">methane</a> — a greenhouse gas nearly 30 times <a href="https://www.epa.gov/gmi/importance-methane">more potent</a> than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere&nbsp;<strong> </strong>— released by beef and dairy cattle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers at universities across the country, including Colorado State University, the University of California Davis, the University of Nebraska, and others, are working to research various feed additives that promise to reduce cows’ methane emissions, as well as breeding cattle to select for low-methane traits. While that’s framed as a sustainability strategy, it comes with an added benefit for the industry’s bottom line: When cows emit less methane, they likely also convert their feed into meat more efficiently and may require less food, according to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fanim.2021.641590/full">some</a> <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1828051X.2017.1404945">studies</a>. In this way, creating combinations of cattle breeds and feed additives that reduce methane may also create more profit for producers and allow for growth in the sector.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Environmental advocates have <a href="https://modernfarmer.com/2024/04/biogas-mega-dairies-problem/">raised concerns</a> that methane-reduction strategies such as feed additives and manure digesters may ultimately end up creating more, not less, pollution, since they offer farmers additional income streams and promote growth of the industry. In <a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/low-carbon-fuel-standard">California</a>, for example, dairy producers can receive <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28122023/milking-it-battle-underway-california-dairy-biogas-market/">lucrative financial credits</a> for producing biogas by capturing methane from manure. Public university research and extension programs have<strong> </strong>advanced the <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=106096">increasing popularity</a> of manure digesters by <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/agricultural-anaerobic-digesters-design-and-operation#:~:text=Earlier%20anaerobic%20digesters%20for%20biogas%20production&amp;text=Laboratory%20experiments%20to%20produce%20methane,treat%20settled%20waste%2Dwater%20solids.">testing prototypes</a> in their own research facilities and creating <a href="https://learningstore.extension.wisc.edu/products/anaerobic-digestion-from-animal-manure">educational resources</a> for farmers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One <a href="https://foe.org/resources/biogas-or-bull/#:~:text=Herd%20sizes%20at%20facilities%20with,nearly%2085%2C000%20dairy%20cows%20total.">study</a> by the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth found that herd sizes at livestock facilities with manure digesters grew 3.7 percent, on average, each year — 24 times the growth rate of overall dairy herd sizes.<strong> </strong>“We are not saying that this is like a primary driver of [dairy industry] consolidation, more that it is a factor that can exacerbate an existing trend toward consolidation,” said <a href="https://foe.org/team-members/chloe-waterman/">Chloë Waterman</a>, senior program manager for FOE’s Climate-Friendly Food Program. Consolidating livestock can lead to worsening pollution and increased animal welfare harms.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/AP24030658867435.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.73733135571,100,78.525337288581" alt="Dairy cows are lined up in a metal circular indoor &quot;milking parlor,&quot; where they&#039;re each milked by machines." title="Dairy cows are lined up in a metal circular indoor &quot;milking parlor,&quot; where they&#039;re each milked by machines." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Cows are milked on a large carousel at an industrial dairy farm in Wisconsin. | Morry Gash/AP Photo" data-portal-copyright="Morry Gash/AP Photo" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">These methane-reduction strategies can shave off emissions, but only at the margins. Without pairing those technologies with a plan to reduce meat and dairy production, we stand <a href="https://www.wri.org/insights/without-changing-diets-agriculture-alone-could-produce-enough-emissions-surpass-15degc">little chance</a> of limiting global warming below targets set by global climate experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That reality is hard to square with land-grant researchers’ role in the livestock industry. As they provide the basic research that advances temporary solutions such as feed additives and manure digesters, public university researchers simultaneously lend a patina of scientific expertise to industry-backed claims that the animal agriculture industry shouldn’t be blamed for climate change and does not need to scale down. The <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f13ca3e0d7b7a5d4bf7abc8/t/65da7fa3688e982d508a23a1/1708818344236/Real+Pork+Consortium+Proposal.pdf">Real Pork Trust Consortium</a> offers a particularly extreme example, with its goal to “enhance pork’s image among global consumers and societies.” But it’s hardly alone.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The rise of “climate-smart” meat and dairy</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, records gathered by <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2022/10/31/frank-mitloehner-uc-davis-climate-funding/">Unearthed,</a> an investigative journalism project funded by Greenpeace, and also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/climate/frank-mitloehner-uc-davis.html">covered</a> in the New York Times, found that the Clear Center, a research institute at UC Davis run by prominent animal industry scientist Frank Mitloehner, had <a href="https://www.desmog.com/2022/11/03/animal-agriculture-industry-commits-millions-to-prominent-university-animal-science-research-center-documents-show/">received millions of dollars</a> in gifts from the animal feed and livestock industry, particularly Ifeeder, a nonprofit founded by an industry association whose members include meat giants Cargill, Tyson Foods, and a subsidiary of JBS, the world’s largest meat company.<strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The research funded by Ifeeder was, in part, meant to investigate the role of feed additives in reducing enteric methane emissions. Industry funding is common in academic research and isn’t, on its own, necessarily compromising. But Mitloehner is also an outspoken <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGG-A80Tl5g">defender</a> of livestock farming and downplays animal agriculture’s role in the climate crisis, acting as a climate expert for the industry’s needs via written articles, media interviews, and presentations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one <a href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/23259351-clear-center-about">document</a> explaining the Clear Center’s purpose, Ifeeder wrote that “Mitloehner provides a neutral, credible, third-party voice” and that data produced by the Clear Center will “show consumers that they can feel good about the choice they are making to include protein in their families’ diets.” Mitloehner told Unearthed that “the Clear Center works with the livestock sector to make it better for the environment. To suggest we’re doing anything other than that is a gross mischaracterization of what we do,” and that “the Clear Center and myself are not concerned with the financial interests of stakeholders or others in the livestock industry.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A similar story emerged at Colorado State University in 2020, when a partnership between the university and various beef industry groups formed AgNext, a program dedicated to research that advances sustainability in the livestock sectors, according to its <a href="https://agnext.colostate.edu/about/">website</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AgNext’s first director, Kimberly Stackhouse-Lawson, who used to work as the chief sustainability officer for JBS USA, has received at least $574,467 from the cattle, pork, dairy, feed, and pharmaceutical industries (including NCBA and JBS) to, in part, research livestock sustainability, according to records obtained by <a href="https://aria.info/about-us/">ARIA</a>, a research organization focused on climate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both Stackhouse-Lawson and AgNext researcher Sara Place, who worked previously for animal pharmaceutical company Elanco and was senior director of sustainable beef production research at the National Cattlemen&#8217;s Beef Association, completed their PhDs under Mitloehner’s supervision. Place’s doctoral work evaluated the impact of an Elanco feed additive on methane emissions in dairy cattle. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like Mitloehner, Stackhouse-Lawson has <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/uploadedfiles/stackhouse-lawson_testimony_package.pdf">spoken</a> about her belief that regulations of greenhouse gas emissions should not burden producers financially and that sustainability goals should not hinder “value chain profitability.” Like the Clear Center, AgNext has emphasized communicating to the public that animal protein is an <a href="https://perma.cc/82H7-KRMP">essential part of a healthy diet</a> and not the climate culprit that other scientists make it out to be. Mitloehner and Stackhouse-Lawson have both been involved in advancing policies aligned with the livestock industry’s interests and have given congressional testimony regarding climate change and animal agriculture.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“To the extent Mitloehner and Stackhouse-Lawson publish peer-reviewed research related to climate change, their work focuses primarily on the use of feed additives or other technological and industry-led solutions, or promoting greenhouse gas accounting metrics that are favorable to the US meat and dairy industries,” write Jacquet and Morris in their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03690-w">paper</a> about the Clear Center and AgNext.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In recognition of the impact of agriculture on climate change, AgNext researchers work with members of the entire livestock value chain to understand current practices and systems and identify viable and scalable options that can move the industry toward a sustainable future,” Place said in an email. “While it is common for industry and government to fund programs, equipment and even research, university research is independent and objective — funding sources have no influence on AgNext research outcomes. To be clear, it is not true that AgNext promotes ‘greenhouse gas accounting metrics that are favorable to the US meat and dairy industries.’” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Pennsylvania State University, meanwhile, researchers were <a href="https://www.psu.edu/news/agricultural-sciences/story/penn-state-awarded-grant-help-dairy-farmers-develop-climate-smart/">granted up to $25 million</a> from the USDA to work with the Center for Dairy Excellence, a consortium of Pennsylvania dairy trade groups, and ag tech company Proagrica to develop “climate-smart” dairy farming practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Penn State program ultimately aims to assess the climate impacts of methods Pennsylvania dairy farmers are already using.&nbsp;With a better idea of the emissions reductions of certain farming practices, dairy farmers could participate in a voluntary climate market, where the greenhouse gas reductions of their practices are sold as carbon offsets for which farmers receive a payment, according to Caroline Novak of the Professional Dairy Managers of Pennsylvania, a trade group that has partnered with Penn State for the project. “Implementing and maintaining climate smart practices costs farmers money. They have to find a way for the practices to pay for themselves. If they are forced to do it without financial sustainability,&nbsp;there will be no farms left to feed people,” Novak said in an email. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s reminiscent of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/8/23863100/tyson-climate-friendly-beef-burger-usda">“climate-smart” label piloted by Tyson</a> last year for beef that the company claimed emitted 10 percent less than its overall beef herd. The actual emissions reductions of the program are unclear, and even with a 10 percent emissions reduction, beef is far from climate-smart: It’s by far the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food">worst food</a> for the climate, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/dining/climate-change-food-eating-habits.html">dairy</a> is not far behind.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/Untitled.png.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=6.6270833333333,0,86.745833333333,100" alt="Aerial view of hundreds of cows concentrated in a feedlot." title="Aerial view of hundreds of cows concentrated in a feedlot." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="An aerial shot of Nebraska-based Adams Land &amp; Cattle Co., Tyson’s sole supplier of its Brazen Beef line. | Google Maps/Environmental Working Group" data-portal-copyright="Google Maps/Environmental Working Group" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">As is the case with feed additives, manure digesters, and the Tyson program, farmers may be earning more without having to change much about the way their farms operate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">“<strong>Science depends on the questions we ask</strong>”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">University research, Jacquet and Morris argue, offers legitimacy that corporations themselves cannot achieve.<strong> </strong>As universities partner to advance the livestock sector via projects like the Clear Center, AgNext, and the Real Pork Trust Consortium, they miss opportunities to use their resources to advance sustainability solutions that decenter productivity and profitability and prioritize the public interest, including environmental health, public health, and animal welfare.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><em>Research shows that industry funding can influence the types of questions asked, and studies that are unlikely to find information useful to industry are less likely to get funding</em>.</p></blockquote></figure>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Asking who this serves is really important,” Jacquet said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research aimed at increasing profit is “yet another form of subsidy to the industry,” Winders said. “That&#8217;s not a public service. It&#8217;s not like those profits are going to be spread across society. Those profits are going to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">highly, highly concentrated</a> industry. And so it&#8217;s helping these already extremely profitable multinational corporations make even more money.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research shows that industry funding can influence the types of questions asked, and studies that are unlikely to find information useful to industry are less likely to get funding. One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6187765/">2018 study</a> of research across multiple STEM fields found that corporate sponsorship of research “can drive research agendas away from questions that are the most relevant for public health.” At the moment, much of the public research into animal farming is following this path by pushing advancements only into climate solutions that allow for industry growth while employing public university researchers to spread the message to consumers that industrial animal farming isn’t as harmful as they might think.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, research into alternatives to the livestock sector, such as cell-cultivated meat and plant-based alternatives, receives comparatively little public funding, <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/pdf/S2590-3322(23)00347-0.pdf">as shown by recent research</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Projects more relevant to environmental concerns and public health could include studies that advance production of plant-based proteins, Winders said, or initiatives that educate farmers on organic farming methods, said Horowitz. Such initiatives could also help farmers unhappy with exploitative contracts with meatpacking companies to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22609382/plant-based-meatless-future-transition-farmers-meatpacking-workers">escape the industry</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, land-grant researchers have strong incentives to prioritize the interests of powerful, highly polluting incumbent industries. But there are infinitely many paths that university research could take.“Science depends on the questions we ask,” Heath said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This spring, <a href="https://docs.iza.org/dp16959.pdf">a European study came out</a> with the provocative conclusion that having children contributes “little to nothing” to the persistent gap in earnings between men and women.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study caught my attention because I know the threat of earning less as a parent has had a chilling effect on people in my generation considering starting families. Last year, while I was reporting <a href="https://www.vox.com/features/23979357/millennials-motherhood-dread-parenting-birthrate-women-policy">on motherhood dread</a> in the US, young women told me they feared having kids would mean they’d be penalized in the workplace, affecting their financial security and opportunities. Meanwhile, the media does little to allay that concern: “One of the worst career moves a woman can make is to have children,” the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/upshot/a-child-helps-your-career-if-youre-a-man.html">once declared</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while these economists found that Danish women who used in vitro fertilization experienced a large earnings penalty right after the birth of their first child, over the course of their careers, this penalty faded out. Eventually, the mothers even benefitted from a child <em>premium</em> compared to women who were not initially successful with IVF.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, the so-called “motherhood penalty” that says women pay a price in the workplace for becoming moms might be less severe than previously thought.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As children grow older and demand less care, we see that the mother’s earnings start to recover, with much of the immediate penalties made up 10 years after the birth of the first child,” the researchers wrote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What makes this new European research so notable is that it relies on the same high-quality data that has informed previous studies on the motherhood penalty (<a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/19/17018380/gender-wage-gap-childcare-penalty">including one Vox covered in 2018</a>) but used an even broader sample and <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/instrumental-variables">an approach</a> the authors argue is better suited for long-term conclusions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This wasn’t the first time I’d seen research that complicates our understanding of the motherhood penalty. After the essay on motherhood dread was published, I heard from <a href="https://sociology.cornell.edu/sharon-sassler">Sharon Sassler</a>, a Cornell University sociologist who studies relationships and gender.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She had recently published a paper on gender wage gaps in the computer science field and found that mothers in computer science actually earned more than childless women (though this “wage premium” was significantly less than what fathers earned).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It was difficult for me to find a home for <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0293300">the attached article</a> because reviewers cannot fathom that mothers might out-earn single women, though there is a growing body of evidence that [they] do,” she wrote in her email to me. “It might be selection [bias] &#8230; but given that folks have found this <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/rsf.2016.2.4.05">across</a> <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7758/rsf.2016.2.4.07">disciplines</a> suggests that the motherhood penalty really needs to be reassessed.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was curious about Sassler’s suggestion that moms might actually earn more and that we don’t often hear that because gatekeepers “seem to like the narrative that women are always screwed by family.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I decided to dig into the literature, reviewing studies and talking with researchers to get a better sense of what we know. Some aspects of the motherhood penalty debate remain fuzzy and unsettled, including whether moms face&nbsp;a long-term disadvantage in the workplace at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also some disagreement over what the problem is, exactly: Is it that mothers earn less than childless women? Is it that they’re earning less than fathers, or men who started their careers at a similar level? What is the social problem to address?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid our growing national conversation around <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355985/birth-rates-falling-policy-family-size-us">declining birth rates</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/abortion">reproductive freedom</a>, a clearer sense of the research on motherhood penalties could help policymakers answer these questions. It could also <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/padr.12431">foster conditions</a> that help more women feel secure making the choice to become parents if they want.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What we know about the motherhood penalty</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Putting these unresolved questions aside for a moment, the research we have paints a different picture from the one that suggests having children is inherently a career-killer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though it <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/26/women-experience-a-motherhood-penalty-for-dads-theres-a-pay-bump.html">doesn’t always make it into</a> the media discussion, scholars know that the motherhood penalty — which <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?journal=Industrial+and+Labor+Relations+Review&amp;title=The+motherhood+wage+penalty+revisited:+Experience,+heterogeneity,+work+effort,+and+work-schedule+flexibility&amp;author=DJ+Anderson&amp;author=M+Binder&amp;author=K+Krause&amp;volume=56&amp;publication_year=2003&amp;pages=273-294&amp;">past research</a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000312240106600203">has found</a> <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657300">averages</a> 5 to 10 percent per child for women in their 20s and 30s — can vary significantly based on occupation, the age at which women have their first child, their marital status, their cultural background, and whether they live in an urban or rural environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Averages can mask a lot, too. White women <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229724149_Marriage_and_the_Motherhood_Wage_Penalty_Among_African_Americans_Hispanics_and_Whites">tend to experience</a> higher motherhood penalties than Black and Hispanic women, but the magnitude of the penalty has <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318047890_The_Family_Gap_in_Pay_New_Evidence_for_1967_to_2013">gone down significantly for all women</a> over the last 50 years, thanks to factors such as increased educational attainment and mothers returning more quickly to work after having kids. In some fields, there’s no penalty at all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We shouldn’t think of child penalties as something that’s immutable or a constant,” said Henrik Kleven, a Princeton economist who has studied these dynamics closely. “It’s something that has changed over time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moreover, though there’s real evidence that some women experience penalties after having kids, we don’t have very strong evidence that it’s a lasting hit. Other research suggests people may time their pregnancies to when their earnings <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4554407">were already flattening out</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One 2014 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4041155/">study</a> found that for most women who had fewer than three children, the motherhood penalty essentially disappears, both in terms of wages and job status, once they reach their 40s and 50s. As the more recent study on Danish IVF users also showed, the context around the motherhood penalty changes when we take a longer view.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those considering children deserve to make parenting decisions with the best information possible, including factors that could minimize or even eliminate labor market disadvantages. Finishing school before having kids, for example, is <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4554407">linked</a> to lower or nonexistent motherhood penalties. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many women would prefer to have kids while they’re younger even if that means they can’t maximize their lifetime earnings. Still, the growing body of research can help make the case for policies that mitigate the negative tradeoffs of having kids and create more family-friendly cultures in the process.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, though, should the goal be to try and eliminate all penalties that mothers face?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kleven, the Princeton economist, thinks it’s unrealistic and undesirable to expect <em>no </em>wage penalty after having kids. “It’s very natural, and I think right, that someone bears a child penalty. I don’t think we necessarily want to move to a world where we outsource all child care,” he told me. Rather, the goal, he said, should be to have “similar-sized motherhood and fatherhood penalties” — for the cost of parenting not to be so gendered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s reasonable, but it’s also not the only potential aim. Women worrying about the cost of motherhood instead might care more about closing labor-market gaps through better employer support, or offsetting income penalties women face in the labor market through new tax and transfer programs, like federal paid leave and child allowances.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Theories on the motherhood penalty, explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a few main explanations for the motherhood penalty.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first theory is based on the idea that women might reduce their working hours, switch to part-time jobs, or simply reduce their effort at work once they become parents. This is the “human capital” explanation. The less you work, the less you could earn.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A second theory is that mothers might earn less because they were <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=vi&amp;user=mo4pUgIAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=mo4pUgIAAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C">drawn to more flexible but lower-paying jobs</a>. In other words, moms self-select into occupations that are less lucrative but have other advantages, such as requiring fewer hours or offering remote flexibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A third theory is that <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-05031-001">employers discriminate against mothers</a>, viewing them as less dedicated and reliable. This discrimination could affect whether a woman gets hired at all, what her starting salary will be, whether she’ll be promoted, or if she’s considered <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11047346/">for any leadership role</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://docs.iza.org/dp16959.pdf">study out of Denmark</a> has added a new wrinkle. Economists found that the Danish women successful with their first attempt at IVF earned much less than their unsuccessful counterparts the first year after giving birth, but started to recover income losses by year two, and 10 years out were earning the same amount.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Twenty-five years out, the successfully treated women were earning more on average than their unsuccessful counterparts. The researchers predict their total lifetime earnings to be 2 to 3 percent higher compared to those who were not successful. While the economists don’t have firm explanations for why, they hypothesize that it could be because mothers developed certain efficiency skills while raising young kids, or perhaps that they just weren’t out of the labor force long enough to lose critical skills and relationships. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In many other motherhood wage studies, researchers compare the wages and career trajectories before and after women become moms, in what’s known as an “event-study” approach in economics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kleven, whose motherhood penalty research has mostly fallen into the “event-study” category, defended his past work as a strong way to show at least short-term penalties but acknowledged that it may not be as clear for measuring long-term ones.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have this very simple method where we are just following men and women over time and we see these very sharp patterns in the data around childbirth and our interpretation is that we’re capturing here a causal effect of children on labor market outcomes,” he told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some economists have raised concerns with the Denmark study, pointing out that women with less IVF success — those who are trying to become mothers but have not — may experience their own career setbacks due to disappointment associated with infertility. This could muddy the comparison between childless women and mothers in the labor market, since these childless women were not voluntarily childless. Indeed, <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32445">past research has shown</a> that infertility can cause “a long-run deterioration of mental health and couple stability.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Petter Lundborg, the lead author of the Denmark study, agreed infertility anxiety could theoretically&nbsp;skew their results, but he told me that the data suggests mental health wasn’t a major factor and neither was divorce.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have <a href="https://docs.iza.org/dp8609.pdf">this previous paper</a> where we follow these women for 10 years and look at their mental health through the use of antidepressants and we see there’s actually very little of that going on, whereas there’s actually a slight uptick among antidepressant use for people who have kids,” he said. “But these are all small levels that could not possibly explain any of the effects we see, and the same goes for divorce.” He acknowledged the evidence on all this is “mixed.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the Denmark study can tell us&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How useful are the Danish findings, really, for people living in other countries?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Denmark is a very progressive nation, after all, offering women one year of paid parental leave, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/upshot/child-care-biden.html">affordable child care</a>, and IVF under national health insurance. None of that applies to the US. People who seek IVF generally also tend to be older, further along in their careers, and typically done with their educational training. They’re people less likely to experience large penalties; their pregnancies are inherently planned ones.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this threatens how useful the findings might be for a wider audience. The study’s co-author, Erik Plug, said they’d like to transport their research design to other countries to compare, though few have as detailed, accessible data to mine through. (This is why so many fertility studies, even those by American scholars, use Nordic information.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the Denmark research builds on other studies that indicate that the motherhood penalty is much smaller in magnitude when women are older and have already finished their schooling.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4554407">high-quality Nordic study</a> that looked at women whose IUDs inadvertently failed found the labor market effects of these unplanned pregnancies were much larger for younger women and for women still enrolled in school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We can see unplanned pregnancies at different stages of life, and some are more costly,” <a href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/directory/yana-gallen">Yana Gallen</a>, the study’s lead author, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Younger mothers experience this firsthand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The concern that having a kid too early (i.e. before hitting one’s labor market potential) will affect one’s career and lifetime earnings is based in reality,” <a href="https://mattbruenig.com/2024/05/17/does-the-child-earnings-penalty-actually-exist/">said</a> Matt Bruenig, the founder of the left-wing People’s Policy Project think tank.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unless something changes in the way our society values money or distributes money, he added, more women will continue to plan to have their first child later in their reproductive years. Even if that’s not always what they really want.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Policies that could help mitigate adverse workplaces for moms&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US remains the only country in the industrialized world without federally funded paid leave, and research <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2657300">has long indicated</a> that policies like <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0730888415615385">universal child care and moderate-length paid</a> leave can help mitigate motherhood penalties by helping women stay connected to the labor market. (Paid leave longer than a year, by contrast, <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23069/w23069.pdf">can negatively affect women’s earnings and employment,</a> partly due to atrophying skills and missed career opportunities, and employer bias that the mother is less committed to her job.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another way policymakers could address the motherhood penalty is by trying to offset whatever loss in job earnings moms may incur from taking on child-rearing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Maternity presents unique challenges to labor market participation and therefore earnings, but focusing solely on earnings as the relevant metric of inequality misses that societies have other ways of compensating people who face labor market disruptions,” Bruenig told me.&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For <a href="https://wfrn.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Differences-in-Disadvantage-Variations-in-the-Motherhood-Penalty-across-White-Women%E2%80%99s-Earnings-Distribution-with-Michelle-Budig-intl-corner.pdf">low-income mothers in particular</a>, researchers find that job turnover or having to reduce their work hours accounts for a significant amount of the motherhood penalty they experience. Low-wage jobs are typically the least likely to offer remote flexibility that makes balancing parenting with work <a href="https://www.hamiltonproject.org/publication/post/prime-age-women-are-going-above-and-beyond-in-the-labor-market-recovery/">easier</a>, and the least likely to come with benefits like paid leave. Expanding policies <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/7/27/23806695/child-tax-credit-ctc-poverty-families-refundable">like the Child Tax Credit</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/10/18302183/tax-cut-democrats-earned-income-tax-credit-child-allowance">the Earned Income Tax Credit</a> could help.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Continuing the cultural shift toward fathers’ contributing more domestic labor could <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-10432-004">also help reduce motherhood penalties</a> by making it easier for women to balance their work and home duties. Federal policies that encourage both men and women to take parental leave could bolster this; Iceland and Sweden both offer 13 weeks of non-transferrable parental leave for dads, for example, and about 90 percent of new fathers there do take it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Creating conditions for involved fatherhood in a baby’s first year of life can set egalitarian parenting patterns for a lifetime, Cecilia Machado, an economist who studies the motherhood penalty, recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/22/opinion/gender-pay-gap.html">told the New York Times</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just as we all could benefit from a more nuanced conversation about motherhood penalties, so too could we gain from a more careful conversation about fatherhood penalties, where differences among subgroups also exist. In 2013, Harvard sociologist Alexandra Killewald <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-03470-005">found a positive wage boost</a> (about 4 percent) only for fathers among those dads who were married, living with their children, and the biological parent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond public policies like child care, paid leave, and child subsidies, there could be more cultural pressure on employers and schools to help people balance their work and caregiving demands. Women recognize they could face genuine financial risks if they have children too early, but that doesn’t mean society can’t do its part to change those economic tradeoffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scholars still have outstanding questions when it comes to the motherhood penalty. Gallen, the economist whose experiment looked at women with IUD failure, told me researchers have much to learn about children’s life outcomes, including life satisfaction overall. “How did the children born into all these different circumstances fare? Are they happy?” she asked. “Or do they seem like they grew up in these strained environments where everybody’s having all these difficult choices? I think that we truly don’t know the answer.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lundborg, the Danish study author, says he’s interested to see how their results hold up in different countries. “We do think that the evidence on long-run child penalties has been very weak, and there’s now some new evidence that challenges this notion that kids are responsible for long-run gender gaps in earnings,” he said. “If the results hold, then I think we need to find alternative explanations.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These findings could ultimately be positive for women hoping to balance careers, financial stability, and parenthood. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This narrative that kids are to blame for the earning gaps between males and females has been extremely strong in economics,” added Lundborg. “So yeah, let’s see what the future holds.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case for Biden 2024 is weaker today than it was immediately after the first presidential debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">disastrous debate performance</a>, Democrats implored their standard-bearer to prove that he had merely “had a bad night”: He could prove his mental acuity, rhetorical competence, and vitality through <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/democrats-media-demand-biden-do-more-interviews-press-conferences-amid-debate-fallout">a blitz of live television appearances</a> and press conferences. And he could demonstrate his cognitive and neurological health by submitting to clinical testing and then releasing the results to the public.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, the president conducted two secretly<em> </em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-black-radio-questions-approval-ff92ebeff33df7ef5a87a59f776c981c">pre-scripted radio interviews</a>, and then sat for a single, 22-minute television Q&amp;A — after taking a week to prepare — and still <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359160/biden-abc-news-interview-drop-out">repeatedly failed to articulate coherent thoughts</a>. In one of his clearest answers, however, Biden conveyed his adamant refusal to undergo cognitive and neurological testing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden followed this up with a call-in interview to MSNBC’s <em>Morning Joe</em> on Monday. During that appearance, the president seemed to <a href="https://x.com/ryangrim/status/1810318214708023741">be reading off of written notes</a> — and still sometimes failed to <a href="https://x.com/EricLevitz/status/1810318568472395955">complete his own sentences</a>, trailing off after losing the thread of a talking point about Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, a wide array of <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/conspiracy-of-silence-to-protect-joe-biden.html">Democrats</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/biden-age-concerns-world-leaders-democrats-6d753921">foreign officials</a> have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/politics/biden-lapses.html">told reporters</a> that Biden’s debate performance wasn’t an anomaly: The president has repeatedly suffered similarly disquieting mental lapses in private. Democratic donors revealed that Biden <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-donors-freaked-out-his-reliance-teleprompters-private-fundraisers">bizarrely relied</a> on a teleprompter to deliver remarks in the private home of a patron.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Voters appear similarly unnerved. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/upshot/poll-biden-trump-debate.html">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-debate-should-biden-be-running-mental-abilities/">polls</a>, upward of 70 percent of Americans say Biden is not fit for a second term. And Trump’s lead over the president has grown both <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">nationally</a> and in <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/wisconsin/trump-vs-biden">battleground</a> <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/pennsylvania/trump-vs-biden">states</a> — despite the fact that Biden is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/355756/joe-biden-campaign-ad-trump-convicted-criminal">drastically outspending his opponent</a> on TV ads, an advantage that will soon disappear as the Republican begins tapping his own formidable campaign funds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In light of all this, the president’s die-hard supporters have been forced to lean on a variety of unsound arguments for his candidacy. I refuted <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/358461/replace-joe-biden-drop-out-kamala-harris">several of these</a> in a column last week. But a new one gained prominence over the weekend, which can be summarized as, “History teaches us that changing nominees this late in the race is electoral suicide.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is how the Boston College history professor (and hit Substack author) Heather Cox Richardson put the point on <a href="https://x.com/amanpour/status/1809615469026197959">CNN Saturday</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>In the whole picture of American history, if you change a presidential nominee at this point in the game, the candidate loses. And it loses for a number of reasons. First of all, because the apparatus of the party for the election is set up around somebody else. Second of all, because the news is only going to report all the growing pains of a brand new campaign, including all the opposition research that the opponents are then going to throw at people.&nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This analysis is badly misguided. It is founded on a fundamentally absurd premise: that we can ascertain eternal truths about politics from the outcomes of exactly two elections. And the argument’s substantive assessment of those elections is also highly dubious. Most critically, though, Richardson completely elides the extraordinary nature of Biden’s liabilities. History cannot tell us what happens when a party chooses to replace its cognitively compromised, 81-year-old nominee because no American political party has ever before faced such a predicament.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>No, “history” does not prove that replacing Biden would be a mistake</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first problem with Richardson’s take is conceptual: You cannot derive timeless laws of political science from a correlation in a dataset with a sample size of two.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In modern US history, a sitting president has abruptly declined to seek renomination in an election year on only two occasions. Harry Truman <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/29/truman-declines-to-seek-another-term-march-29-1952-1238358">dropped out in March of 1952</a> after being upset in the New Hampshire primary. Around <a href="https://www.history.com/news/lbj-exit-1968-presidential-race">the same stage in the 1968 race</a>, Lyndon B. Johnson announced that he would not seek renomination, amid widespread opposition to his handling of the Vietnam War. In both instances, the Democratic Party ultimately lost the general election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But one cannot draw any general conclusions about the wisdom of switching standard-bearers in an election year from these facts. This is because you cannot responsibly glean <em>any</em> general rule from a correlation supported by two data points. It is true that Donald Trump won a general election when Democrats nominated a candidate under 70 years old in 2016, but then lost when Democrats nominated a candidate over 70 in 2020. But it would be bizarre to look at those facts and conclude that “In the whole picture of American history, when Democrats nominate a non-septuagenarian to take on Donald Trump, the candidate loses.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Richardson’s reasoning is only a bit less absurd. In 1952, the Democratic Party had held the White House for 20 consecutive years, and the GOP picked a moderate, popular general, Dwight Eisenhower, as its nominee. Is it not possible that Democrats lost for these reasons, rather than because Truman stepped down? For all we know, the party could have done even worse if Truman had been the nominee; we do not have access to the counterfactual. We can’t get in a time machine, change one variable, and then run history again. And without the benefit of such an experiment, we cannot know with certainty whether Truman dropping out helped or hurt his party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The same can be said of LBJ’s decision to withdraw from the 1968 presidential race. Maybe the Democrats lost that election for the reasons Richardson states: Johnson dropped out, and his replacement, Hubert Humphrey, struggled to win as much support because the “party apparatus” was built around LBJ (whatever that means) and the news media reported on opposition research about Humphrey.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But how precisely are we proving that thesis? How do we establish that Democrats would have done better with Johnson on the ballot? After all, LBJ was even more closely identified with the Vietnam War, and therefore even more likely to internally divide the Democratic coalition, than Humphrey was. And many features of that election cycle favored the Republicans, including a widespread <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/05/02/why-campus-chaos-should-give-democrats-ptsd-00155537">backlash to civil rights</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/07/donald-trump-law-and-order-richard-nixon-crime-race-214066">rising crime</a>. Despite these headwinds, Humphrey nearly won the popular vote. How do we know that LBJ wouldn’t have done worse?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political scientists often compensate for the inherently small sample size of US elections by examining voter behavior abroad. And when we widen the lens, the idea that switching leaders last-minute is always damaging becomes even more dubious. To take one example: In 2017, New Zealand’s Labour Party saw its support fall below 25 percent less than two months before election day. In response, the party’s leader, Andrew Little, stepped down and his deputy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/01/andrew-little-resigns-as-new-zealand-opposition-leader-weeks-from-election">Jacinda Ardern, replaced him</a>. Labour proceeded to gain support, ultimately winning <a href="https://elections.nz/media-and-news/2017/new-zealand-2017-general-election-official-results/">37 percent of the vote</a>, enough to lead a left-of-center coalition government with Ardern as prime minister.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There is no historical precedent for Democrats’ current predicament</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Richardson overestimates what we can learn from the past, she also understates Biden’s challenges in the present. His current position is not analogous to that of LBJ or Truman. Both of those men weren’t yet in their 70s, let alone their 80s, as Biden is today. Both also were competent public speakers, and there was no evidence — public or private — that they were suffering from severe cognitive decline.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Richardson’s suggestion that replacing Biden would harm Democrats, as the news media would publish damaging stories about his replacement, is especially odd. If the party sticks with Biden, it is an absolute certainty that there will be news stories spotlighting Democrats’ private <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/30/top-aides-shielded-biden-white-house-debate">concerns about his cognitive health</a>, along with the president’s every public misstep. And it is also certain that Biden will struggle to combat the implications of these stories through vigorous campaigning, and eloquent interviews. We know these things because they are already happening.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, Richardson’s implicit claim that Biden’s replacement will suffer from more negative media coverage appears to be based on nothing but a hunch. She does not acknowledge that the new nominee would almost certainly be better equipped to both 1) participate in lots of media interviews and 2) speak coherently during them, and might therefore receive <em>more</em> favorable press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most critically, Richardson fails to engage with how bleak Biden’s current odds appear. The president <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">has a 37 percent</a> approval rating. He has trailed Trump both nationally and in virtually every swing state for months. Before he advertised his cognitive decline at the first debate, Biden had failed to catch up to Trump despite falling inflation and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/352465/trump-convicted-felon-elections">his rival’s criminal conviction</a>. It is extremely unlikely that the president will be better able to overtake Trump in the coming months than he had been before the depths of his senescence were revealed on national television.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The real choice Democrats face</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In truth, the question facing the Democratic Party is this: Is running a historically unpopular, 81-year-old president who cannot maintain a normal campaign schedule or speak coherently — and who is considered unfit for leadership by <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-debate-should-biden-be-running-mental-abilities/">more than 70 percent of voters</a> and many of his own allies in Washington — really the best way for Democrats to keep Trump out of power?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">History cannot answer this question, not least because there is no historical precedent for the Democrats’ current predicament.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we do know is that just about every hypothetical alternative to Biden — Vice President Kamala Harris, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Josh Shapiro, etc. — has <a href="https://x.com/EliClifton/status/1808208301911691573">a lower disapproval rating</a> than he does. And we also know that making any of those alternate candidates the Democratic nominee would dramatically shake up the presidential race and the narratives around it. Suddenly, the valence of age as an issue would flip: The Democrats would have a nominee in the prime of life, while the GOP would be saddled with a 78-year-old, whose own incoherence and mental lapses would be more apparent against a much younger rival.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t mean that a new candidate would <em>definitely</em> perform better than Biden. The fact <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/358559/biden-harris-whitmer-newsom-shapiro-buttigieg-alternative-nomination-candidate-2024">that fewer voters have a strong opinion about Harris and Whitmer</a> implies that they could win more support than the president — but also, that they theoretically could win less. But at this point, such uncertainty is a virtue. When you are on track for an almost-certain loss, it’s wise to gamble on a course of action with unpredictable consequences. And this is especially true in this specific circumstance, wherein common sense dictates that having a candidate who is physically and cognitively capable of running a vigorous campaign is preferable to having one who looks and sounds irrevocably diminished by age.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To believe otherwise is to mistake historical anecdotes for immutable laws, and <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/status-quo-bias-psychological-definition-4065385">status-quo bias</a> for sage insight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden avowed that he was “firmly committed” to staying in the 2024 presidential race, in a <a href="https://x.com/mviser/status/1810300473439551489/photo/1">letter to House Democrats</a> released Monday morning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And in addition to maintaining that he believed he was the best person to beat former President Donald Trump, Biden’s letter relied heavily on one particular argument: that he was the choice of Democratic primary voters, and it would be wrong to overturn their decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The voters of the Democratic Party have voted. They have chosen me to be the nominee of the party. Do we now just say this process didn’t matter? That the voters don’t have a say?” Biden wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I feel a deep obligation to the faith and the trust the voters of the Democratic Party have placed in me to run this year,” he continued. “It was their decision to make. Not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, not any selected group of individuals, no matter how well intentioned. The voters — and the voters alone — decide the nominee of the Democratic Party.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one more flourish, Biden said he viewed remaining on the ticket as crucial to his larger stand in defense of American democracy: “How can we stand for democracy in our nation if we ignore it in our own party? I cannot do that. I will not do that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Viewed through a certain lens, that argument is ridiculous. Biden ran against no serious opposition in a low-turnout, low-interest primary season. Democrats worked to deter any credible alternative from running, and if any had run, they would have faced intense criticism for disloyalty to the president and harming his chances against Trump. And since Biden avoided debates, primary voters arguably lacked crucial information about how he’d fare in one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet Biden’s characterization is not entirely off-base. Just as he says, the effort to push him off the ticket is very much an elite-driven initiative, with support strongest in the (unelected) media, while rank-and-file Democratic voters have mixed feelings about it. Any process to pick a new nominee at this late date would not truly have widespread popular participation. And if anyone credible had run against Biden in the primaries, they very likely would have lost.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But should the votes of the 15 million people who voted in Democratic primaries earlier this year be the be-all end-all for what represents “democracy”? Perhaps the party deliberating over and choosing a different option is its own form of democracy in action. And what about the 150 million or so people who may vote in the fall — most of whom, polling suggests, have concerns about Biden’s age and would prefer a different Democratic nominee? Should their views matter?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden won the 2024 primary before voting even began&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Due to his low approval ratings and age, there was occasional speculation that Biden might not run for reelection in 2024. Some polls in 2022 and 2023 <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-norc-poll-biden-2024-presidential-prospects-c843c5af6775b4c8a0cff8e2b1db03f6">showed</a> a majority of Democratic voters saying he shouldn’t run again. But he never seems to have seriously considered bowing out. After taking office, he <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022/06/13/biden-2024-election-white-house">consistently said</a> he intended to run again, and in April 2023 he <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/25/1145679856/biden-president-announcement-2024-running-reelection">made that official</a>. (It’s likely that Democrats’ better-than-expected performance in the midterm elections prevented what would have been some pressure on Biden not to run again.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once Biden was in, Democratic officials fell solidly behind him. That is quite normal for an incumbent president — the last president to face a serious primary challenge was Jimmy Carter in 1980, and credible primaries against incumbents at any level are relatively rare. Parties frequently try to deter such challenges, viewing primaries as messy, expensive, divisive, and potentially harmful to the party’s general election chances (Carter lost).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the end, none of the party’s ambitious governor or senator rising stars wanted to roll the dice of challenging Biden — believing they likely would have lost, and then been blamed if Trump won in the general. A little-known Congress member, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN), was the only elected official who jumped in the race. Author Marianne Williamson wasn’t a serious contender, and activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. pulled out of the primary to run as an independent in the general election instead.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some polling suggested that Democratic voters weren’t exactly thrilled with their lack of plausible options. In September, a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/09/07/poll-biden-2024-second-term-democrat-voters-cnn">CNN poll</a> of Democrats and Democrat-leaning independents found that only 33 percent said they wanted Biden as the nominee, and 67 percent wanted someone else. The problem is: Who else? An imaginary idealized alternative polls better than a real person, and no polling showed any specific potential candidate anywhere near Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Could this have been different if Gov. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/07/06/bypassing-biden-democrats-think-of-what-could-have-been-00104803">Gretchen Whitmer</a> (D-MI), Gov. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/06/us/politics/biden-primary-challenger.html">Gavin Newsom</a> (D-CA), or someone else had jumped in the race? We’ll never know for sure, but I’m skeptical. One could spin an optimistic scenario where such a candidate suddenly catches fire, or a messier one in which something akin to Biden’s bad debate performance drags him down. But challenging an incumbent president in the primary is a very difficult thing to pull off.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality is that Biden won the 2024 primary well before voting even began, by winning the “inside game.” In doing so, he prevented disgruntled Democrats from having a realistic alternative to him on the ballot. So it’s a bit rich that he’s now arguing that the process presented a sacrosanct verdict of the people. Still, it seems very likely to me that he would have won even if a more formidable challenger jumped in.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Should primary voters matter more than the party or the general public?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One question going forward is whether the primary results are still valid in describing the “will of Democratic voters” in the wake of the debate; polls have found wildly different results.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/only-michelle-obama-bests-trump-alternative-biden-2024">Reuters/Ipsos</a> found that 66 percent of Democratic voters said they wanted Biden to stay in the race.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-expands-lead-over-biden-after-debate-as-voters-age-worries-grow-wsj-poll-finds-c3a793ab?mod=article_inline">Wall Street Journal</a> poll found the exact opposite result — that 66 percent of Democratic voters said they wanted to replace Biden as the nominee.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">New York Times/Siena College</a> poll landed in the middle, with 48 percent of Democrats wanting Biden to stay in and 47 percent wanting a different nominee.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polls are just polls, and because we can’t rerun a six-month primary process on short notice, there’s no plausible way to actually have a nationwide vote on the matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another question, though, is whether the “will of Democratic primary voters” really should outweigh all other concerns in determining whether Biden remains the nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The modern presidential primary process <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/28/how-un-break-primaries/#KAMARCK:~:text=Throwing%20a%20bone,at%20the%20convention.">was created in the 1970s</a> as an attempt to give voters, not party insiders (who were often criticized as corrupt backroom dealers), more of a say in choosing the nominees. But in recent decades, that system has come under criticism from two fronts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One group of critics is, essentially, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/05/opinion/biden-primary-democrats-republicans.html">pro-party</a>. They believe party deliberations are a form of democracy, even if it’s not mass participatory democracy as expressed in elections. They don’t shudder at the prospect of giving “party insiders” more of a say in picking nominees — that’s how parties in many other democracies function, and it’s how American political parties functioned until the past half-century. They think parties should be able to respond to circumstances, deliberate on the best path forward, and present their preferred candidates to voters. So they’d argue that Democrats would be well within their rights to replace Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another group of critics is anti-polarization. They believe that, in practice, party primaries are low-turnout affairs that too often prize extremists and ideologues — like Trump — and fail to produce candidates who appeal to the broader electorate. Some <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23412858/nevada-question-3-final-five-voting-katherine-gehl">argue that the partisan primary</a> and the two-party system are breaking America, and seek voting reforms to shake up the system. But basically, they think our political system is too responsive to primary voters and not responsive enough to the general electorate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They might point out that large majorities of voters have, for years, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-age-poll-trump-2024-620e0a5cfa0039a6448f607c17c7f23e">said</a> Biden <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/broad-doubts-bidens-age-acuity-spell-republican-opportunity/story?id=99109308">was too old</a> to serve another term — but that the primary process failed to present voters with a viable alternative option, and now the country is stuck choosing between Biden or Trump. Why should a country where over 150 million people may vote be held hostage to the preferences of <a href="https://www.thegreenpapers.com/P24/D">15 million Democrats</a> who barely even got a choice?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no sugarcoating it: Any process to replace Biden at this late date would inevitably be driven and dominated by party elites, and could not really be reflective of mass public participation on the level of the primaries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the 2024 primaries were not exactly a sterling testimony to the wonders of democracy either. It’s entirely possible — though far from assured — that a process to replace Biden could produce a more popular nominee aligned with the preferences of more voters overall.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Sunday’s French parliamentary elections, voters delivered a serious shake-up of the status quo, one that now means that, in France, there’s no longer a strong center, but rather a politics increasingly dominated by extremes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The election saw the highest turnout since 1981, as well as a sharp rebuke to the far-right National Rally (RN) which came out on top in the first round of the contest and saw a major victory in June’s European Parliament elections. However, President Emmanuel Macron and his center-right Renaissance party aligned with the brand new left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front (NFP) in an electoral tactic that prevented RN from taking power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The victory of the resurgent left reflects a new, highly polarized political reality for France.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Macron’s centrists won second place behind the NFP, it will not be able to form a government without appealing to the left. And that will not be easy; some members of the NFP have publicly refused to go into coalition with Macron’s party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Macron <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/357602/france-elections-2024-parliament-marine-le-pen-macron-normalize">dissolved</a> France’s National Assembly last month after the RN trounced his party in the European Parliament elections. Macron’s technocratic, neoliberal policies have been deeply unpopular in France; Renaissance came in third after the RN and a new coalition of France’s left during the first round of elections on June 30.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While that may have been enough to keep the far right from real power, that doesn’t mean the new coalition will have an easy time governing. Just months ago, the Greens, Socialists, Communists, and France Unbowed, led by the fiery and controversial politician Jean-Luc Mélenchon, were deeply fragmented over personal and ideological differences. But “historically, when there is a threat from the extreme right, the left always unifies,” Rémi Lefebvre, a political scientist at the University of Lille, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/world/europe/france-left-new-popular-front.html">the New York Times</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the group has agreed on a platform, there are still serious questions about leadership and whether the coalition can govern beyond the immediate threat of the RN. That’s without factoring in Macron and his party, which, since Macron has promised not to step down, will also presumably be in what is called a cohabitation with the left-wing alliance to govern. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The coming weeks will see France struggling to form a functioning government, but this election has shown one thing quite clearly: The far right and the left wing, not Macron’s centrism, are dominating French politics.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The left, the right, and the disappearing center</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As part of Renaissance’s electoral partnership with the New Popular Front, both parties pulled candidates from Sunday’s race, making the choice clear: It’s the RN versus everyone else.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a strategy that reflected France’s decades-long social pact, called the cordon sanitaire, which effectively prevented the far right from gaining power after the horrific rule of the Nazi-collaborationist Vichy government during World War II. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And Sunday’s results showed that it was ultimately successful. The mere fact that it was necessary, however —&nbsp;and that Macron now likely depends on the left wing to be able to govern — sends a strong signal of where French politics is now.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Macron succeeded in creating that centrist party,” Patrick Chamorel, senior resident scholar at the Stanford Center in Washington, told Vox. “But there is no alternative because all the alternatives were either far right or far left, he destroyed the moderate of right and left. And now he is collapsing his own party. So there&#8217;s nothing left except for the extremes.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the RN has existed for decades, first as the National Front under Jean-Marie Le Pen, the party had never been more than marginal until 2012, when Le Pen’s daughter Marine first ran for president as the party’s leader. The RN slowly gained legitimacy and popularity in French politics, with Marine Le Pen winning a greater share of the vote in the 2017 and 2022 presidential elections —&nbsp;which Macron won.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of Le Pen’s strategy has involved toning down the RN’s most noxious and hateful ideologies, particularly about migration and antisemitism, to make it more palatable. She ejected her father from the party in 2015 after he repeated comments that downplayed the Holocaust and attempted to reframe her father’s policy of reserving social services for French citizens. That has been reflected in public opinion; support for the RN has increased <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2024-france-national-rally-support/?sref=qYiz2hd0">in nearly all of France’s municipalities since 2017</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the RN pushed a platform centered on restricting social services for non-citizens. “They want to deprive people who don&#8217;t have the French nationality or people who are illegal migrants, for example, for any health coverage,” Sandrine Kott, a professor of modern European history at the University of Geneva, told Vox. “It&#8217;s very clear, it&#8217;s not even hidden —&nbsp;it&#8217;s very clear what they want, they want to exclude [migrant workers from] social apartments, social housing, and so on,” on the basis that they are taking social services away from people born in France.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to the right, France’s politics follow a general trend in Europe. The right has been building toward this moment over the past 15 years: Right-wing parties have been steadily gaining influence in Europe since the far-right German party the Alternative for Deutschland started in 2013, and the two right-wing blocs — the Identity and Democracy (ID) and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) — now hold 131 of 720 seats in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/354601/european-parliament-elections-macron-afd-national-rally-far-right-fidesz-france">European Parliament</a>, an increase of 15 seats from the last election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However,  the threat of an RN government reignited the foundering left. Mélenchon, for instance, came in a very close third behind Le Pen in the 2022 elections, and a 2022 coalition of the main left-wing parties provided a formidable counter to Macron in the National Assembly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the public has put the left wing in a position of power but it doesn’t have a mandate — and that raises the question of whether any governing can happen with this upcoming National Assembly. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens now?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The left-wing coalition&#8217;s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/business/france-economy-macron-national-rally.html">platform includes</a> lowering the retirement age to 60, raising the minimum wage, and freezing the prices of basic goods to combat a cost-of-living crisis that has swept much of Europe in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia’s war in Ukraine. It has also promised to make the asylum process easier —&nbsp;a direct counter to RN, which demonizes immigrants and promised to cut immigration — as well as recognize a Palestinian state and push for a ceasefire in Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite being the most powerful single bloc after Sunday’s vote, the New Popular Front won’t necessarily be able to push through its ambitious agenda for the next three years. Instead, there will likely be piecemeal reforms, with the left-wing coalition relying on alliances with other parties to push legislation through.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Macron’s term runs to 2027 and he insists he is not stepping down as president. His handpicked prime minister, Gabriel Attal, tendered his resignation Monday, as his party doesn’t have a parliamentary majority. Macron has asked him to stay at his post for “the moment to ensure the stability of the country.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a few options for moving forward. Macron <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/videos/video/2024/01/16/what-s-the-role-of-france-s-prime-minister_6438308_108.html">could have a prime minister from the left wing</a> — a “<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a7c5fc5a-b73f-4e3e-ac95-db833526a063">cohabitation</a>” in French political parlance. Who that prime minister would be is an open question as the New Popular Front has no official leader. In the immediate term, the goal is to form a government, which will likely require an alliance between the New Popular Front and another faction, potentially with Macron’s centrists, which came in second place (though some, like Mélenchon, have ruled out that possibility). NFP politicians have said that they will put forward a prime minister candidate within the week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re going to have a situation we’ve never known before, with the absence of a stable, coherent, homogeneous majority, very different from the three cohabitations that took place previously. And there is no natural choice for prime minister in these political circumstances,” <a href="https://www.ustavnisud.ba/en/didier-maus">Didier Maus</a>, a constitutional law specialist, told <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240708-french-government-in-limbo-after-elections-produce-hung-parliament">the AFP</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Macron’s center-right, neoliberal politics have never quite fit in with French political tradition — something protests last year against raising the retirement age demonstrated as many French people resented the notion that their right to stop working would be violated for the sake of productivity. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this puts France in an unusual position. Macron’s Renaissance party seems at a dead end, and there are no longer any other viable centrist parties; there’s RN, and there’s the left-wing coalition, which is still shaky, despite its impressive mobilization leading up to the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That could spell more instability down the road and raises the question of what happens in the next presidential election. There could be new, invigorated leadership from the French left, or the coalition could fall apart. It’s not clear what the future for centrists like Macron is, and though the RN lost resoundingly this time, it’s not going anywhere. </p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">This past week saw elections in two of the world’s biggest democracies, the United Kingdom and France. The results of Britain’s July 4 election were (mostly) as expected: a romp for center-left Labour, dethroning the Conservative party after 14 years in power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Sunday’s French results came as a surprise. The far-right National Rally (RN), <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/357602/france-elections-2024-parliament-marine-le-pen-macron-normalize">widely predicted to triumph</a>, came in third place. The New Popular Front (NFP), a left alliance ranging from the center-left socialists to the radical France Unbowed, took a plurality of seats —&nbsp;a stunning victory made possible by tactical coordination with President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Renaissance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Almost immediately after the French results came in, the takes began flying. The results proved that <a href="https://x.com/anneapplebaum/status/1810023594111431164">the center was surging against the far-right</a>. Or perhaps that <a href="https://x.com/CurtMills/status/1810090940238905708">the left is on the march</a>. Or perhaps, in <a href="https://x.com/GoodwinMJ/status/1810248126944403719">one especially deluded analysis</a>, that the results were proof of the far-right’s long-run rise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The truth is that none of these analyses really hold up. There isn’t an obvious ideological throughline here, a grand story to tell about What This All Means for the world in 2024&nbsp;— or what it might say about the mindset of American voters in November. Trying to tell the story of these elections as some unified left-versus-right struggle ends up misleading more than it helps.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if you look at it through the lens of institutions — the ways that electoral systems and choices by party leaders shape outcomes — some key lessons start to pop out. In particular, the winning parties in both the UK and France won by realizing that the nature of their systems required that they sacrifice some specific candidates in order to defeat the right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that’s where there might be a lesson for America — and for <a href="https://x.com/owasow/status/1810052801927770172">the Democratic party in particular</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A muddled ideological story</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no doubt that right-wing factions lost in both Britain and France. But though both countries arrived at somewhat similar results, the actual story they tell is more complicated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour’s victory over the Tories in Britain was not really an endorsement of its political agenda. While the party took about two-thirds of the seats in parliament, it managed to do so by winning a large number of constituencies by relatively narrow margins (with third party help). Robert Ford, a political scientist at the University of Manchester, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/07/labour-safe-seats-marginals-landslide-victory-vote">noted that</a> “more than half of their seats [were] won with a majority of 20 percent or less.”  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nationally, Labour only won 34 percent of the national popular vote — the lowest tally for a winning party in British history. Opinion polling on the eve of the election showed Labour leader Keir Starmer <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/keir-starmer-approval-rating">underwater with British voters</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than anything else, the British election reflected simple frustration with 14 years of Conservative rule. Nearly half of all British voters said their reason for voting was to “<a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/49947-why-are-britons-voting-labour">get the Tories out</a>.” Voter turnout in 2024 was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-uk-election-keir-starmer-labour-party-conservative-party-british-politics-voter-disillusionment/">the second-lowest it’s been in a hundred years of UK elections</a>, with many voters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/07/key-takeaways-voting-patterns-uk-general-election-2024#:~:text=The%20Lib%20Dems%20won%2072,and%20whizzing%20down%20a%20waterslide.">turning away from the UK’s two major parties</a>. The centrist Liberal Democrats won a record-high number of seats; the far-right Reform party won over ten percent of the national popular vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The French results also do not tell a simple ideological story.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s difficult to call them a triumph for the center when Macron and Renaissance took a major electoral hit, going from 245 seats in parliament to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/07/world/europe/france-election-results-left-surges.html">roughly 150</a>. The left did better than anyone expected, but still lacks a governing mandate: the New Popular Front fell well short of a parliamentary majority, while the most prominent far-left faction in the alliance made <a href="https://x.com/KarimPalant/status/1810043655345819933">virtually no gains</a>.<sub> </sub>And it’s impossible to call a third-place finish for the RN a victory given its <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/357602/france-elections-2024-parliament-marine-le-pen-macron-normalize">expectations</a> of an outright majority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What to make of this? Like in Britain, there’s a certain level of anti-incumbency at work: most French voters were fed up with Macron and made that clear at the ballot box. But at the same time, they clearly also still reviled the far-right — leading the center and (especially) the left to do better than most assumed they would.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anglo-French election week did not tell a story of any particular ideology rising. More than anything else, they tell us that people in Britain and France don’t especially love any of the options on offer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The real story: electoral systems and party tactics</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The best way to think through the British and French systems is through their electoral similarities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like the United States, both countries elect legislative candidates based on whoever wins in majorities in particular districts — a system known as first-past-the-post. This is in contrast to proportional systems, where parties are awarded a percentage of seats that reflect their popular vote share. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But unlike the United States, both countries currently have more than two parties represented in the national elections. This arrangement creates opportunities for electoral gamesmanship: for parties and their supporters to make district-by-district tactical choices designed to elevate one rival against a more hated alternative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s exactly <a href="https://x.com/robfordmancs/status/1810019391087501728">what happened in both countries</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the United Kingdom, Labour and the Liberal Democrats <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/27/labour-lib-dem-tactical-voting-plans-impact-tory-seats">implicitly</a> encouraged “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/07/labour-safe-seats-marginals-landslide-victory-vote">tactical voting</a>” against Conservatives. In a district where Labour was better positioned to beat the Conservative, Liberal Democratic voters crossed over to vote for them —&nbsp;and vice-versa. This appears to have been decisive in both parties performing unusually well in Parliament despite slight improvements in the national popular vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">France has a two-stage election system, with the first vote (which took place a week ago) winnowing out weaker candidates to produce either a two or three-person race. In between the first and second rounds, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/2/more-than-200-candidates-pull-out-of-french-run-off-to-foil-far-right">hundreds of candidates</a> from Renaissance or the NFP strategically withdrew to give the other faction’s candidate a head-to-head race against the RN in districts where they were better positioned to win. By making this deal to minimize vote-splitting, both parties ended up performing better than expected — at the far-right’s expense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The point here is that elections are not merely about the public mood or grand ideological narratives. They often come down to which party can better game the electoral system, and whether the center and the left can overcome their differences to cooperate against a radicalizing right.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what should Americans take from this?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Americans worrying about the rise of our own far-right, the main lesson from England and France is not about ideological positioning or some grand truth about the fate of the far-right movement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather, it’s that systems matter — as do the choices party leaders make about how to adapt to those systems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike France and Britain, the United States only has two viable choices on offer: the center-left Democrats and the radical right Republicans. And when it comes to the most powerful job in our system, that’s currently a choice between two men: Biden and Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden can’t count on help from other parties to boost him the way it helped Labour or the NFP; polling suggests he actually does slightly worse when third parties are on the ballot. Instead, he and his party will be forced to face an electorate that — like their French and British peers — aren’t especially happy with any of the choices on offer. Those elections also suggest that, in such elections, incumbents tend to fare poorly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their systems, the French and the British had a strategy for addressing their problems: sacrificing marginal legislative candidates in service of the greater good of defeating the right. But in the American system, sacrificing marginal candidates won’t be enough to overcome the effects of general public discontent and anti-incumbent sentiment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here, the ticket is defined by the president — a man increasingly seen as too old for the public to trust in addressing their concerns. Defeating the right might very well require the center-left in America to make a more radical kind of political sacrifice: <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/358461/replace-joe-biden-drop-out-kamala-harris">a change at the very top of the ticket</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, there is no guarantee that cutting bait on Biden wins Democrats the election. But this read of the developments in our peer democracy —&nbsp;that the center-left requires creative and unsentimental tactical thinking to defeat the far-right —&nbsp;is much more accurate than concluding the far-right wave is ebbing of its own accord.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of the United States’ most important governing institutions are failing at once.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congress, of course, has long been barely able to function. Every year, it <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24106177/government-shutdown-funding-bills-normalized">struggles merely to fund the rest of the government</a>, and the risk that it will trigger a debt ceiling breach that would <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/5/24/23736112/debt-ceiling-economy-default-treasury-janet-yellen-stock-market">set the global economy on fire</a> is alarmingly high.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican Party has atrophied into a cult of personality, centered on an authoritarian who literally <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/7/31/22603477/trump-efforts-overturn-election-results-rosen-donoghue">tried to overthrow the duly elected United States government</a>. The Democratic Party, meanwhile, may be <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/358461/replace-joe-biden-drop-out-kamala-harris">unable to dislodge a senescent leader</a> who is no longer capable of making the case against his imperious opponent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s the Supreme Court, perhaps the only branch of the United States government that is capable of speaking in complete sentences right now. But the most recent Supreme Court term, which ended last week, makes one thing clear: Don’t confuse the Court’s relative eloquence for competence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The justices are <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/4/15/24131456/supreme-court-transgender-health-care-labrador-poe">barely able to manage their own docket</a>, even though it’s been <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/24145279/supreme-court-shrinking-docket-quiet-quitting">shrinking for decades</a>. They <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/10/24/23914235/supreme-court-domestic-violence-abusers-gun-policy-us-rahimi">publish incompetently drafted decisions</a> that sow confusion throughout the judiciary, then <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen">refuse to accept responsibility</a> when those decisions lead to ridiculous and immoral outcomes. They <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/27/23184848/supreme-court-kennedy-bremerton-school-football-coach-prayer-neil-gorsuch">take liberties with the facts of their cases</a>, and they can’t even be trusted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/30/23779903/supreme-court-student-loan-biden-nebraska-john-roberts">read the plain text of an unambiguous statute correctly</a>. In just the last few years, they’ve <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/24/23181720/supreme-court-dobbs-jackson-womens-health-samuel-alito-roe-wade-abortion-marriage-contraception">overruled</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23616868/supreme-court-affirmative-action-harvard-unc-students-fair-admissions-john-roberts">so many</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/27/23184848/supreme-court-kennedy-bremerton-school-football-coach-prayer-neil-gorsuch">seminal</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">precedents</a> that law professors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/opinion/constitutional-law-crisis-supreme-court.html">no longer know how to teach their classes</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the justices did not wield such awesome power, and if lawyers who practice before them did not have to treat them with ritualized obsequiousness, most of the justices would be laughingstocks. Few people this famous are so ostentatiously bad at their jobs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, despite their incompetence, the justices continue to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">claim more and more power</a> — even though they <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">simply do not have the personnel</a> or expertise needed to address every policy question they’ve added to their own plates. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I used to believe that Trump and his followers and the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group that played an enormous role in <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/9/20962980/trump-supreme-court-federal-judges">choosing his judges,</a> were two distinct authoritarian movements that shared power during Trump’s four years in office. The MAGA movement is a cult of personality that seeks to elevate a singularly chaotic man. The Federalist Society and its allies prefer a distinctly lawful tyranny that still follows predictable rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But then the Federalist Society’s picks took over the Supreme Court. And they have behaved&nbsp;so haphazardly, with such eagerness to smash institutions built over decades or even centuries, that it’s hard to see them as anything other than Donald Trump with a law degree. Unlike Trump, the Court’s Republican majority speaks in polished legal prose when they decide to hurl decades worth of settled expectations into the sun. But their behavior on the bench is no less chaotic than that of the insurrectionist president who appointed half of them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Worse, the United States has what might be called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger</a> Supreme Court — after the psychological phenomenon where incompetent people fail to recognize their own incompetence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The justices aren’t just very bad at their jobs; they appear to be blissfully unaware of just how terrible they are at those jobs. How else can one explain, say, their decision to replace all of American Second Amendment law with a novel and impossible-to-apply legal test — one that led to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23742547/supreme-court-united-states-gun-policy-rahimi-domestic-abusers-spouses-second-amendment">astonishingly depraved results</a> — and then to offer <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen">no new guidance to lower court judges</a>, after all but one of the justices realized just how badly they’d screwed up?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The justices surround themselves with the trappings of competency. They have fancy degrees, and they are advised by law clerks with impressive resumes and stratospheric law school GPAs. They write opinions that make proper use of English grammar — something that, admittedly, neither major party’s presidential candidate appears capable of doing. As many as seven of them have not yet been implicated in what, in any other branch of government, would be a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/355259/supreme-court-thomas-alito-corruption-democrats-dick-durbin">career-ending ethics scandal</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, as the curtain falls on the Supreme Court’s most recent term, no one should think that this particular panel of judges is capable of doing their jobs.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The justices seem incapable of anticipating the consequences of their decisions&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s inability to create sensible legal rules was on full display in its most closely watched decision of the term: <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a>, the presidential immunity case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The holding of <em>Trump </em>is truly shocking. One question that loomed over this case is, in the words of a lower court judge who earlier heard the <em>Trump </em>case, whether Trump could be prosecuted if he’d <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/09/trump-immunity-appeals-court-arguments/">ordered “Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival.”</a> Though the <em>Trump </em>opinion does not answer this question directly, it’s hard to read it as permitting such a murderous president to be prosecuted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For starters, <em>Trump</em> holds “the courts have ‘no power to control [the president’s] discretion’ when he acts pursuant to the powers invested exclusively in him by the Constitution.” One of those powers is the ability to give orders to the military — the Constitution provides that the president “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii">shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in dissent, “When [the president] uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune.</a> Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elsewhere in the opinion, moreover, the Court concludes that presidents enjoy an extremely strong presumption of immunity to prosecution whenever they perform any of the myriad duties entrusted to the president. Under these circumstances, a president is immune “unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition … would pose <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">no ‘dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’</a>”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court also established that immunity applies even if the president orders the Department of Justice to round up and prosecute all of his political enemies. As Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the Court, “the Executive Branch has ‘exclusive authority and absolute discretion’ to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecute,” and thus a decision to use federal prosecutors for political ends falls within the president’s “conclusive and preclusive” authority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I first read the <em>Trump</em> opinion, which was joined only by the Court’s Republican appointees, I saw a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">blueprint for a dictatorship</a>. I feared that the Republican justices responsible for this decision could not possibly have intended to authorize the president to murder his enemies unless creating such a dictatorship was their intent. But <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358326/supreme-court-netchoice-moody-paxton-first-amendment">another decision handed down the same day as <em>Trump</em></a> casts doubt on this hypothesis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s decision in <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358326/supreme-court-netchoice-moody-paxton-first-amendment"><em>Moody v. Netchoice</em></a>, which was handed down just minutes before the <em>Trump </em>opinion, is as normal as the holding in <em>Trump</em> is aberrational. Briefly, <em>Moody</em> concerned two state laws, enacted by Republicans in Texas and Florida, that attempted to seize control over content moderation at major social media platforms. Writing for herself and five of her colleagues, Democratic Justice Elena Kagan <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358326/supreme-court-netchoice-moody-paxton-first-amendment">makes it clear that these laws are not acceptable</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Moody</em> stands for the unremarkable proposition that the government may not seize editorial control over the media. Kagan’s opinion was joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, three Republicans who also joined most or all of the <em>Trump</em> majority opinion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Moody</em> casts serious doubt on the thesis that at least three of the Court’s Republicans intended to pave the road to a MAGA dictatorship. If these justices intended to give Trump the power to kill or arrest his critics, why didn’t they also give Trump’s party the power to control the media — a less disruptive and less violent method of consolidating authoritarian rule?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t know the answer to this question, but I can rule out the possibility that the Republican justices did what they did in <em>Trump</em> because “the law” required them to do so. There is no Presidential Immunity Clause in the Constitution, and what the Constitution does have to say about prosecuting high-ranking officials cuts strongly against the Court’s decision in <em>Trump</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nor does Roberts’s opinion really even try to make the case that presidential immunity can be found somewhere in the Constitution’s text. Rather, the opinion is grounded in a policy judgment that <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">the president should not be chilled</a> from taking, in Roberts’s words, “bold and unhesitating action” by “the threat of trial, judgment, and imprisonment.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Court just gave presidents the power to kill or arrest their rivals and critics. The <em>Moody</em> decision suggests that the immunity decision was not made to usher in a Trump dictatorship. But that simply means that these Republican justices, whether through blundering or reckless disregard for the risks created by their decisions, unintentionally laid the groundwork for murder and oppression.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The justices create problems and then refuse to fix them</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every state’s law <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/a-review-of-exceptions-in-state-abortions-bans-implications-for-the-provision-of-abortion-services/">permits abortions when necessary to prevent a patient from dying</a>, and even most states with strict abortion bans permit it in at least some cases when a patient’s health is endangered by their pregnancy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a practical matter, however, these exceptions to state abortion bans are <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/12/23631278/supreme-court-abortion-texas-medically-necessary-sepsis-zurawski">often worthless</a>. Women have fled to blue states for abortions or been told to wait until they develop truly alarming symptoms because abortion providers are too afraid of being arrested if they perform a medically necessary abortion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reason why this is happening is clear. Because <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/410/113"><em>Roe v. Wade</em></a> (1973) deactivated state abortion bans for half a century, state courts <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/12/23631278/supreme-court-abortion-texas-medically-necessary-sepsis-zurawski">did not hear any cases</a> clarifying when it is legal to perform abortions under state law. Indeed, many states enacted new abortion bans during the period when <em>Roe</em> was in effect that suddenly sprung to life when <em>Roe </em>fell, despite no court decisions whatsoever interpreting those laws.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hospital lawyers, in other words, have no way to advise their clients on when it is legal to perform an abortion and when a doctor who performs one might face years in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This situation is profoundly undemocratic. Every state agrees that abortion should be legal when necessary to save a life, and only <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/06/americas-abortion-quandary/">about 11 percent of Americans</a> believe abortion should not be legal under these circumstances.&nbsp;And it is rather obviously the Supreme Court’s fault. The Court eliminated <em>Roe</em>, a decision that gave doctors and patients a great deal of clarity about when abortions were legal, without giving any thought to how the law would operate in <em>Roe</em>’s absence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This term, the Supreme Court was handed a golden opportunity to fix the abortion crisis that it created. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-726_6jgm.pdf"><em>Moyle v. United States</em></a> asked the justices to enforce a federal law, the <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1395dd">Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act</a> (EMTALA), which requires nearly all hospitals to provide “such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition” of “any individual” who arrives at the hospital’s ER with an “emergency medical condition.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That includes patients who require an abortion to stabilize their condition because EMTALA contains no exception for abortions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Had the Court ruled that EMTALA means what it says, that would have done a tremendous amount to clarify when abortions are lawful, even in very red states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the Supreme Court didn’t simply refuse to read EMTALA according to its plain text. It refused to decide the <em>Moyle </em>case altogether, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357302/supreme-court-leaked-abortion-moyle-united-states">kicking it back down to a lower court</a> for what could be months of more litigation. The non-decision in <em>Moyle</em> means that at least another year is likely to pass before women can stop waiting to develop sepsis before they can receive emergency medical care — and that’s assuming the justices don’t create an unwritten abortion exception to EMTALA when the issue reaches them again in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A similar drama played out in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-915_8o6b.pdf"><em>United States v. Rahimi</em></a>, a case where a federal appeals court concluded that a remarkably violent man, who allegedly committed six different shooting crimes and threatened to kill two women, has a Second Amendment right to own a gun.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To their credit, eight of the nine justices agreed that allowing this man to be armed is unacceptable. But their decision in <em>Rahimi </em>did little to clarify a 2022 Supreme Court decision which seemed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/10/24/23914235/supreme-court-domestic-violence-abusers-gun-policy-us-rahimi">compel lower courts to rule</a> that even this exceptionally violent individual gets to own a gun.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf"><em>New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen</em></a> (2022) held that all gun laws are unconstitutional unless the government can “demonstrate that the regulation is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf">consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation</a>.” A modern-day gun law is particularly suspect under <em>Bruen</em>, moreover, if it addresses “a general societal problem that has persisted since the 18th century.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lower court that heard <em>Rahimi</em> struck down a federal law that disarms people who are subject to domestic violence restraining orders. But the worst part about this lower court’s decision is that it was <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen">correctly decided</a>, at least if you take <em>Bruen</em> seriously. Violence between romantic partners, after all, existed in the 18th century. But there were hardly any laws addressing it, and no state made it a crime for married partners to beat their spouse until 1871.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And while <em>Bruen</em> compelled the immoral result reached by the lower court in <em>Rahimi</em>, its vague “historical tradition” test has baffled judges across the political spectrum, few of whom are trained as historians. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s concurring opinion in <em>Rahimi</em> cited a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/356267/supreme-court-us-rahimi-domestic-abuse-guns-second-amendmen">dozen lower court opinions</a>, all begging the Supreme Court to tell them how, exactly, <em>Bruen</em> is supposed to work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But rather than offer clarity, the Court’s decision in <em>Rahimi</em> is pure gobbledygook. The new rule is that “a court must ascertain whether the new law is ‘relevantly similar’ to laws that our tradition is understood to permit,” whatever that means.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than abandoning <em>Bruen</em>’s framework, which failed immediately and in spectacular fashion and which led a wide array of judges to take the unusual step of speaking out against the Supreme Court, the Court babbled about the history of gun laws for a few pages of an <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-915_8o6b.pdf">unusually short opinion</a>, then left the lower courts to decide the fate of every gun law in the United States with no meaningful guidance whatsoever from the justices.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Court has given itself more power than it can possibly handle</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s just-completed term also featured one of the biggest power grabs in the Court’s recent history. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf"><em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em></a> makes the Supreme Court the final word on hundreds or even thousands of policy questions that Congress delegated to federal agencies like the EPA or the Department of Labor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These questions concern some big policy disputes, such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/18/11702436/obama-overtime-rule">who is entitled to overtime pay</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/30/23189610/supreme-court-epa-west-virginia-clean-power-plan-major-questions-john-roberts">how to reduce greenhouse emissions by power plants</a>. But they also concern a much broader array of minor and often very technical questions that few people are likely to care about. The <em>Loper Bright</em> case itself, for example, asked whether the government or the vessels themselves must <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">pay for federal observers who sometimes accompany fishing vessels</a> at sea.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One bizarre thing about <em>Loper Bright</em> is that the Supreme Court already <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/23791610/supreme-court-major-questions-doctrine-nebraska-biden-student-loans-gorsuch-barrett">gave itself an unchecked veto power</a> over anything involving what the Court calls a “major question” — that is, agency actions that involve a matter of “vast ‘economic and political significance.’” So the justices were already the final word on policy questions that sparked meaningful political disagreement. All that <em>Loper Bright</em> does is force the courts to decide many more less significant questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These are questions like how much residents of Kauai, Hawaii, should <a href="https://casetext.com/case/mass-dept-of-telecomms-v-fed-commcns-commn">pay for cable television service</a>, or whether a wastewater treatment plant in Taunton, Massachusetts, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">emits too much nitrogen</a> — questions, in other words, that are both far beyond the expertise of the justices and so small they aren’t really worth the time of the nine most powerful officials in the most powerful nation that has ever existed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taken in aggregate, federal agencies have thousands or even tens of thousands of employees, many of whom have very specialized expertise and perform the very intensive fact-finding and information-gathering process that any responsible government must perform before it regulates. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court, by contrast, has nine justices, each of whom <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">typically hires four law clerks to assist them</a>. That’s nowhere near enough staff to handle the firehose of hypertechnical policy questions the Court just directed at federal courts, and ultimately at the justices themselves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The unmanageable volume of cases headed the Court’s way will be further magnified by the Republican justices’ recent decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-1008_1b82.pdf"><em>Corner Post v. Federal Reserve</em></a>, which effectively eliminates the six-year statute of limitations that used to apply to lawsuits challenging federal regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Corner Post</em> holds that this six-year clock begins to count not when an agency issues a new rule but when a new business is formed that is subject to that rule. Thus, any company under six years old is allowed to challenge any federal regulation that impacts it, even if that regulation has been on the books for decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, thoughts and prayers to the justices, who will now have to deal with the unmanageable workload they’ve created for themselves, even as they are unable to handle the cases that are already on their docket in a competent manner.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This Court can’t even manage its own docket</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a young Reagan White House lawyer in the 1980s, future Chief Justice Roberts had a biting wit. “The generally accepted notion that the court can only hear roughly 150 cases each term,” Roberts wrote when he was just beginning his career, “gives the same sense of reassurance as the adjournment of the court in July, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/30/politics/politicsspecial1/white-house-memos-offer-opinions-on-supreme-court.html">when we know that the Constitution is safe for the summer</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polls show that most Americans <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/supreme-court/">now feel the same way about the Supreme Court</a>, but Roberts’s very good joke is also notable because it describes a Court that hears “roughly 150 cases each term.” This term, by contrast, the Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/23">only decided 59 cases</a> that received a full hearing and oral argument.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As lawyer and political scientist Adam Feldman has documented, the size of the Court’s workload has been in <a href="https://empiricalscotus.com/2018/01/09/light-workload/">steady decline since the 1960s</a>:</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/temp.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,1.486622796484,100,97.026754407032" alt="A graph showing the decrease of court cases heard and decided per Supreme Court term over the last decades." title="A graph showing the decrease of court cases heard and decided per Supreme Court term over the last decades." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Adam Feldman/Empirical SCOTUS" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For anyone who wants a deep dive into why this is happening, I <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/24145279/supreme-court-shrinking-docket-quiet-quitting">wrote about it here</a>. For now, I’ll simply note that the Court’s shrinking docket has come largely at the expense of the kind of boring, relatively low-stakes legal disputes that the Court used to decide on a regular basis. The Court’s political docket, cases involving contentious issues that tend to split the two political parties, has not shrunk at all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court, in other words, no longer really functions as a court. It spends less and less time deciding bread and butter legal issues that should be the core work of judges, and more and more time resolving political questions that often should be decided by people who hold elected office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, despite its ever-shrinking workload, the current slate of justices appear barely able to keep on top of their jobs. As the New York Times’s Adam Liptak wrote in mid-June, “The Supreme Court has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/politics/supreme-court-rulings-june.html">moving at a sluggish pace</a> in issuing decisions this term, entering the second half of June with more than 20 left to go.” That’s a significant slowdown from the Court’s historic pace. This was also a rare term when the Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/slipopinion/23">did not finish handing down decisions by the end of June</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the justices are struggling to keep up on their work, even as that workload shrinks. It’s anyone’s guess how they will handle the expanded workload that is coming their way once lawyers start filing new suits under <em>Loper Bright</em> and <em>Corner Post</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Court’s ethics crisis</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, any evaluation of the Court’s competence must consider Justice Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito’s loose relationship with judicial ethics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most government officials are subject to strict limits on their ability to accept gifts. Members of Congress and their staff, for example, are typically forbidden from accepting any gift <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/11/14/23960027/supreme-court-new-ethics-code-clarence-thomas-unenforceable">valued at more than $50</a>. Thomas, by contrast, has accepted millions of dollars worth of gifts from Republican-aligned billionaires. And Alito accepted a $100,000 private jet ride from Republican billionaire Paul Singer, before staying in a $1,000-a-day fishing lodge and reportedly drinking wine that costs over $1,000 a bottle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, after months of embarrassing news stories examining Thomas’s and Alito’s corruption, the Court responded with a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/11/14/23960027/supreme-court-new-ethics-code-clarence-thomas-unenforceable">toothless, largely unenforceable ethics code</a> that does nothing to limit the justices’ ability to take similar gifts in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, the primary effect of this ethics code appears to be giving the justices something they can cite to justify their ethical lapses. After Alito came under fire for flying flags conveying right-wing political messages outside of his two homes (Alito blames the flags on his wife), he cited the new ethics code — and specifically its statement that a justice is “<a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/352380/supreme-court-alito-ethics-recusal-insurrection-flags">presumed impartial</a>” — to justify taking no corrective action.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These justices, moreover, continue to sit on corruption cases despite their own corruption. In <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-108_8n5a.pdf"><em>Snyder v. United States</em></a>, for example, they joined a majority opinion ruling in favor of an Indiana mayor who <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357170/supreme-court-snyder-united-states-corruption">accepted a $13,000 gift from a trucking company</a>, after the mayor’s city entered into a $1.1 million contract with that company.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, the current Court is unable to write a coherent legal standard. It removes essential safeguards against tyranny and dictatorship. It can barely handle a shrinking caseload, yet appears determined to flood itself with some of the most difficult and low-stakes policy questions that come before the federal government. And it can’t even follow the most basic norms establishing that government officials should not be on the take.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We live in an age of babbling and incoherent leaders. The Supreme Court is no exception.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past year, <a href="https://www.sonnyangel.com/en/">Sonny Angel</a> — a biblically inaccurate, 3-inch-tall cherub figurine with peculiar headgear — has taken over the hearts, minds, phones, display shelves, and nightstands of collectors across the world. The plastic dolls, wearing helmets ranging in form from pancakes to sunflowers, are garnering millions of views on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsjakeflemm/video/7261751179980426539?q=sonny%20angel%20unbox&amp;t=1719405935742">TikTok and Instagram</a>, popping up in supermodel <a href="https://www.nylon.com/life/how-sonny-angel-became-gen-z-darling">Bella Hadid</a>’s social media posts and on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonnyAngel/comments/1cf4bah/not_victoria_beckham_being_into_sonny_angels_too/">Victoria Beckham’s phone</a>, and the subject of an entire sketch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTvWtHVA8E"><em>Saturday Night Live</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like any phenomenon where someone is buying tons of a thing that you may not be, the obvious question arises: Why is everyone so obsessed with these tiny winged boys?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The simplest answer is the official <a href="https://sonnyangelusa.com/pages/about">Sonny Angel</a> slogan: “<a href="https://www.sonnyangel.com/en/about/">He may bring you happiness</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s a tantalizing promise. Money can’t buy you happiness, allegedly. But it can buy you a Sonny Angel. At the retail price of $10 per doll, that’s a deal many have already taken, some collectors dozens of times over.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A more fascinating answer is that maybe Sonny Angels, like anything people love, give us a better understanding of what happiness is. What if you could find it in a tiny doll who wears a cute hat?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are Sonny Angels?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite that, canonically, they are toddlers, Sonny Angels are 20 years old, created in 2004 by a manufacturer named Toru “Sonny” Soeya. Soeya was inspired by the cuteness of the <a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1094436/why-kewpie-mayo-has-a-baby-on-its-logo/">Kewpie mayo baby</a> and his creations share many of their predecessor’s traits — in particular, their amiable roundness. They also have similar circular eyes, always looking up and to the side instead of straight on, like they’re either slightly embarrassed or flattered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Dreams, the Sonny Angel distribution company in the US, Soeya made these dolls to assuage the stresses of young working women in Japan. Around the time of Sonny Angels’ creation, Japan was going through <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB111076614439978347">a mild recession</a> and would get hit hard again <a href="https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/spn/2009/spn0905.pdf">four years later in 2008</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/IMG_5251-2.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,22.388453552521,100,55.223092894957" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The highly coveted lop-eared rabbit Sonny Angel. | A. Abad-Santos/Vox" data-portal-copyright="A. Abad-Santos/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“He referred to them as a ‘pocket boyfriend’ which I think may have gotten lost in translation a little bit,” Jackie Bonheim, the director of marketing at Dreams, the US Sonny Angel distributor, tells me. Bonheim explains that the Sonny Angel appeal is platonic, silly comfort — rather than a supportive romantic boyfriend, they’re more like an adorable baby you don’t have to care for. That cuteness is central to their appeal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://c-research.chuo-u.ac.jp/html/100003324_en.html">Joshua Paul Dale</a> is a professor at Chuo University in Tokyo and the author of<em> Irresistible: How Cuteness Wired Our Brains and Conquered the World </em>in 2023, about how kawaii culture and aesthetic went mainstream. He explains that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260535/#:~:text=Ethologist%20Konrad%20Lorenz%20proposed%20that,function%20of%20enhancing%20offspring%20survival.">time</a> and <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/research/how-cute-things-hijack-our-brains-and-drive-behaviour">time</a> again, research has shown that humans respond to creatures with baby-like features — round eyes, big foreheads, teeny tiny short limbs, globular cheeks. The term is called baby schema or kindchenschema, which both Kewpies and Sonnys embody.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When those features appear in human babies, or puppies, or even juvenile octopi, they trigger a primal, evolutionary response that makes us want to protect that cute thing, likely too young and weak to care for itself.&nbsp; Sonny Angels, with their positively absurd forehead to eyeball ratio and stout limbs, trigger that same instinct.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This protective instinct is made stress-free by design touches that signal Sonny Angels’ (slight) autonomy. They stand straight up on their own. They all have headgear, which they seem to have figured out how to put on themselves. A Sonny Angel can seemingly take care of himself, and more importantly, can make you feel better. Like a tiny friend would.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sonny Angels may bring you happiness&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bowen Yang doesn’t talk about Sonny Angels; he gushes. “You can’t help but smile when you look at one,” the actor, comedian, and <em>Saturday Night Live</em> writer and cast member tells me. On the slogan — “He may bring you happiness” — Yang says, “there’s no ‘may’ involved. It’s an assured thing that a Sonny Angel will make you feel happy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yang, who co-wrote a sweet and slightly sinister, <em>Challengers</em>-themed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFTvWtHVA8E">sketch</a> wherein Dua Lipa turns her boyfriends into Sonnys with fellow writer/Sonny aficionado Celeste Yim, explains that he stumbled upon the dolls in 2018. It was Yang’s first month or so at <em>SNL</em>, and he says that he’d walk around Bryant Park to clear his head whenever he needed a break. One day he dipped into Kinokuniya, a small Japanese gift store, and found a Sonny Angel display toward the back of the shop.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I bought one on a cosmic whim and have been collecting them ever since,” he tells me, noting that his collection is now around 30, scattered around his apartment, writing office, and dressing room. “My first Sonny Angel ever was Apple.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Yang refers to as Apple is a doll from the Sonny Angel Fruit Series who wears <a href="https://www.sonnyangel.com/renewal/wp-content/uploads/cache/2018/11/old_apple_01/2754354942.jpg">red apple-themed headgear</a> with a little leaf coming out of it. All Sonny Angels wear some kind of accessory on their heads; maybe a hat, maybe a helmet, maybe both. (One thing is for sure: They’re decorations, and not natural head growths, as the <a href="https://www.sonnyangel.com/en/about/">official website</a> makes clear.) These cranial ornamentations range from sea creatures like manta rays to alliums like onions and garlic to pets like French bulldogs and Shiba Inus.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These helmets differentiate each Sonny Angel, but raise a plethora of questions.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/IMG_5260.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,22.47485964363,100,55.050280712741" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A Sonny Angel with garlic on his head (left) next to a head of garlic. | A. Abad-Santos/Vox" data-portal-copyright="A. Abad-Santos/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Are Sonny Angels one guy trying on multiple pieces of thematic headgear based on his mood? Or are they different-but-identical-looking guys who have chosen specific helmets that reflect their personalities? What compels a little human to put an onion on his head? Is it a fashion statement or does he really like onions? More than that: Are Sonny Angels wearing these curious crowns because <em>they</em> like them or are they wearing them to make <em>us</em> feel better? And why don’t they have pants?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the aspect of Sonny Angels’s allure that’s difficult to capture — the imagination that these little dolls spur in a person. Each Sonny’s uniqueness ignites storytelling, a narrative we create to reconcile our feelings with the weird cuteness at hand: where it came from, what spurred it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yang tells me about his favorite Sonny Angel: Snake, who has an albino serpent coiled on his head like a turban. “He knows he’s different, and he’s not afraid to be,” Yang tells me. “A diva. He’s not like the other girls. And that’s what we should all aspire to.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some of their biggest fans, Sonny Angels represent a curiosity and an appreciation for the world around us, and are themselves a reminder that there’s wonder in self expression.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The craze over Sonny Angels, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After their cuteness and ability to inspire, the most important thing to understand about Sonny Angels is that you never know which one you’re going to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sonny Angels are part of a bigger toy collector trend known as “blind boxes.” Each doll is individually sealed and packaged, and while buyers can choose a series — e.g., <a href="https://www.sonnyangel.com/en/products/">Fruits, Vegetables, Marine</a>, etc. — they can’t choose a specific Sonny to buy in-store. Barring X-ray glasses or some clever shaking (some buyers believe you tell which Sonnys are by what they weigh and how much they vibrate) there is no guaranteeing what Sonny you’ll get. It’s like opening a pack of trading cards.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dreams also shuffles rare Sonny Angels, known as “secrets,” into the fold as well as special figurines called Robbys. Robby Angel, according to Sonny <a href="https://okinawa.sonnyangel.com/en/aboutsa-2">lore</a>, is Sonny’s “close friend,” but it’s hard to tell whether Robbys are dogs or mice. I asked Dreams’s Bonheim, and she simply responded, “Robbys are animals,” providing no further clarification.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Bonheim and Dreams, there’s a 1 in 144 chance of pulling a secret or a Robby from a regular Sonny Angel series.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This makes buying Sonny Angels feel a bit like gambling. There’s an incentive to buy more than one box to raise your chances of getting the Sonny you want. At roughly $10 a pop, they’re priced low enough that just one more might not break the bank, even if the odds aren’t in your favor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This randomness — and the addictive dopamine rush of opening a Sonny Angel — is tailor-made for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Sonny-angel?lang=en">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sonnydijon?igsh=M2VlM2Z5bnFlZzFi&amp;utm_source=qr">Instagram</a>. The drama, suspense, reveal, joy, and even disappointment in any Sonny Angel unboxing increases the potential for virality. According to Bonheim, Sonny Angels’ popularity on these platforms has driven real-life sales.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bonheim did not specify the exact figures Dreams was making, but did say that sales “spiked” over the past three years with 2023 and 2024 being the strongest in the US. Store owners I spoke to were more specific, having witnessed the boom first hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why I wrote this</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">I will always remember the first Sonny Angel I ever saw: Shark from the <a href="https://sonnyangelusa.com/products/minifigure-marine-series-2019">Marine Series</a>. It was November 2023 and I was at a friend’s house, and on his coffee table, staring right back at me, was this little boy figurine with a sea animal hat on his head. His adorable, round little face was right in the great white’s jaws. I was mostly enamored, a bit mystified, and a little creeped out by that little baby. Later that week, I found myself wanting one of these little weirdos in my own home.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">That was much easier said than done. Everywhere I looked, they were sold out. Apparently you can find everything in New York City — except for Sonny Angels. When I finally procured a Sonny Angel, I decided he needed a friend (or two). Again, easier said than done.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The Sonny Angel shortage, outsize demand, and my need to know exactly why I had to have this little guy in my life sent me on a hunt for Sonny Angels and spurred this piece.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">That, and my editor spotted my collection in the background of our Google Meet and kept asking me if it had grown. (It had.)</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Obviously it’s TikTok,” says Annie Chung, the co-owner of <a href="https://anmeshop.com/collections/sonny-angel">An.mé</a>, a New York toy store and authorized Sonny Angel retailer. “If you look back on the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/anmeshop/?hl=en">videos</a> we have on social media, you can see the growth.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chung has been collecting Sonny Angels since 2004, and selling them since 2014. It wasn’t till post-pandemic lockdowns, around 2021, that she noticed the sales begin to build. At the same time, encouraged by shoppers,&nbsp; An.mé began hosting Sonny Angel meetups and trading events and posting on social media.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“By the third event, all the spots were booked within 30 minutes and over 50 people showed up,” Chung tells me. Chung’s meetups grew each time, eventually moving out of the tight stores, and one 2023 Washington Square Park meet-up brought in over 500 people. “The park ranger thought they were gonna do bad things. But they were all here for Sonny Angels,” Chung says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Chung says she sells between 500 to 1,000 Sonny Angels per week, depending on her inventory. When there’s a new release, the line can snake around the block, with fans lining up hours in advance. Chung’s biggest sellers are “<a href="https://sonnyangelusa.com/products/sonny-angel-hippers">Hippers</a>,” Sonny Angels that you can attach to your phone or any object edge (laptops, iPads, Tesla navigation consoles, etc.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kimberly Bach, co-owner of <a href="https://www.clubhousekidandcraft.com/">Clubhouse Kid &amp; Craft</a>, a toy store and art space in Decatur, Georgia, saw a similar rise in popularity at the end of 2021 and into 2022. Then in 2023 came the moment that she knew changed everything.&nbsp; “The series that started it all was the <a href="https://www.sonnyangelstore.com/en/products/catlife">Cat Life series</a>,” Bach tells me, laughing, of the series that featured the Sonny Angel dude in several cat costumes — Calico, Silver Tabby, Tuxedo, Siamese, et al. — doing “regular” cat things like drinking from a bottle of milk. “It was just like, all of a sudden, it was just a flood of people either coming into the store or buying them online.” Her stock of 140 Sonny Angels sold out in four days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bach tells me that she sells roughly 12 Sonny Angels per day, an extremely successful figure given the size and location of her store.&nbsp;She has a set of regular customers near Auburn, Alabama, who drive almost three hours to her store weekly, along with many other customers without a local Sonny Angel retailer. “If they don’t have one where they live, they come to us,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Bach and Chung note, shopkeepers can’t keep Sonny Angels on their shelves. If they have them in stock, they’re selling them. But their inventories aren’t always stocked, and scarcity makes the demand even stronger.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I would say it’s an unintentional part of the appeal; it’s not something we’re doing on purpose,” Bonheim, the Dreams marketing director, tells me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bonheim explains that a rigid production schedule and a desire to maintain the quality of their figurines means that Dreams makes and distributes a finite amount of Sonny Angels. The company also, intentionally, refrains from selling at big toy retailers, opting instead for smaller specialty toy stores and independent bookstores — a strategy they see as maintaining the spirit of the Sonny Angel as a collectible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Add in to that the roughly two-year design process and resources needed to create a special series like the recently released 20th anniversary Looking Back Hippers series, and there’s no way for Dreams, at their current production rate, to keep up with Sonny Angels’s booming popularity.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The resell market and radical price gouging for Sonny Angels</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The shortage has created a secondary Sonny Angel market where fans can trade or sell Sonnys in their collection. On forums like Reddit or platforms like Discord, Sonny Angel fans have employed collector language (ISO = in search of, DISO = desperately in search of, bf luck = boyfriend luck or the belief that boyfriends will pull better Sonny Angels, UFT = up for trade, and UFS = up for sale) to navigate bartering of Sonnys. The exchange system has created a robust social community, with Sonny Angel fans sending figurines across the US and internationally alongside cute notes, candies, and stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s somewhat of a hierarchy here, experts tell me. Among regular Sonny Angels, the Rabbit Sonny Angels, both regular- and lop-eared, and the Strawberry are the most popular. Bok Choy, Frog, Cow, and Garlic are considered honorary all-star Sonny Angels. Secret figures and Robbys are sought after, and collectors will go after the limited series Sonny Angels because they’re usually one and done. After Dreams sells through a special series, it’s not likely you’ll see them on shelves again for a few years, if at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Obviously though, this voracity for Sonnys doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Resellers have noticed, which is why you’ll see Sonnys marked for outrageous values on sites like Amazon and eBay. For example, the “secret” figure in the 2023 Cat Life series that wears a pink cat costume and holds a gold-tinted fish goes for <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/225693611532?chn=ps&amp;var=524814323197&amp;norover=1&amp;mkevt=1&amp;mkrid=711-166974-028196-7&amp;mkcid=2&amp;mkscid=101&amp;itemid=524814323197_225693611532&amp;targetid=2275367127251&amp;device=c&amp;mktype=pla&amp;googleloc=9060351&amp;poi=&amp;campaignid=21093328230&amp;mkgroupid=163238665671&amp;rlsatarget=pla-2275367127251&amp;abcId=9393327&amp;merchantid=782358246&amp;geoid=9060351&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1emzBhB8EiwAHwZZxRutnOXBCe8LXa3gYy9svr7AvO5uQqv3BjUzYrSlURFRCPOoeAXikRoCRjYQAvD_BwE">$250 on eBay.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Resellers have become such a pain that Chung and Bach, the store owners, put limits on the number of Sonnys that are available to purchase online. Chung checks each order by hand, making sure no one’s cheating the system. If she didn’t, she says, resellers would vaporize her stock and sell them for triple the price on Amazon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It doesn&#8217;t make us happy to see people paying that much,” Bonheim tells me, noting that Dreams is aware of resale sellers and also limits the number of Sonnys a buyer can purchase and monitors orders for funny business. They don’t want “someone opening a Sonny Angel and asking how much money they can make.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After all, she points out, a Sonny Angel’s job is to make you happy — if you’re lucky enough to get your hands on one. </p>

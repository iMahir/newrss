<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s been more than a week since the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit">arrest of music mogul and rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs</a> on a litany of federal charges including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, but the questions surrounding the allegations have only grown in recent days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which of Combs’s many celebrity friends heard about the alleged “freak-offs”? What, if anything, did his former romantic partners, including Jennifer Lopez, know? If there are tapes, what’s on them?&nbsp;Why do people keep talking about Justin Bieber?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not a stretch to draw parallels between Combs’s case and that of notorious sex offender <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/7/20685023/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-arrested-minor-sex-trafficking-charges">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. Copious amounts of money, a long list of powerful friends, and a culture of celebrity silence make for a potent combination that, as <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/8/14/20803950/jeffrey-epstein-conspiracy-theories-clinton-trump-acosta">Anna has written</a>, is “tailor-made to produce conspiracy theories.” In the wake of the arrest, amateur internet sleuths have surfaced numerous videos and photos and pored over interviews with Diddy and his&nbsp;celebrity associates in search of answers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the allegations against Combs continue to pile up. After several civil lawsuits were filed against Combs late last year, another woman came forward in late September<strong> </strong>to allege <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sean-combs-diddy-lawsuit-1e2b124ba85ebf1b4f1e93c8692aab4b">in a 26-page civil suit</a> that Combs and his bodyguard took her to the recording studio for his record label, Bad Boy, in 2001, raped her repeatedly, and recorded the assault.  After putting out a call for additional victims — and netting more than 3,000 responses — lawyers announced on October 1 that they would be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/10/01/diddy-sexual-assault-lawsuit-victims-tony-buzbee/">filing 120 additional civil lawsuits</a> against Combs and several codefendants in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami in the following weeks. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As court filings become public, they promise to unfurl a whole new set of allegations against Combs and offer new details on previously unknown accusations going back decades. The sheer scope of the cases and inclusion of codefendants, plus allegations that Combs used his entertainment business to lure victims, could turn Combs’s case into one of the biggest Me Too reckonings the music industry has seen.<strong>   </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Through his lawyers, Diddy has repeatedly asserted that the civil claims against him are baseless, calling several of them “sickening allegations” made “by individuals looking for a quick payday.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He has pleaded not guilty in the criminal case, too, and is currently being held in a Brooklyn jail after twice being denied bail. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, has said the rapper is “going to fight this with all of his energy and all of his might,” and during a court hearing argued that the so-called freak-offs — marathon sexual productions that prosecutors say involved hired sex workers and women coerced to perform sexual acts for the gratification of Combs and others — were consensual, if unconventional.&nbsp;“Is it sex trafficking?” he asked in court last week. “No, not if everybody wants to be there.” &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>With so many players, civil and criminal cases, and plenty of misinformation floating around, we’re pulling together some of the most frequently asked questions about Diddy and trying to answer them — as best we can, of course, given what we know.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a more detailed history of all the allegations against Diddy, check out Anna’s full explainer <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Combs accused of?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Combs is facing two kinds of cases: one criminal case brought by the federal government and several civil cases brought by individuals, each involving different accusations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Combs was arrested on criminal charges; the government alleges that he used his business enterprise to conduct criminal activity, including sex trafficking and kidnapping, and then used his power to intimidate victims and cover up the crimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case centers on the alleged performances with women and sex workers. The indictment alleges that Diddy often transported sex workers to perform in the sessions and taped the encounters to coerce silence from participants, using an array of employees and his business organization to facilitate the criminal activity. For all of this, they’ve charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-r-kelly-keith-raniere-prosecutions.html">a powerful charge</a> that was originally used largely to prosecute organized crime leaders and can result in a hefty sentence.&nbsp;<br><br>It was the civil cases, however, that opened the floodgates that ultimately led to the indictment.<br><br>In November 2023, Combs’s ex-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, also known as the singer Cassie, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit">filed the first explosive lawsuit</a> that exposed several allegations against Combs to the public, including that the rapper orchestrated the performances with sex workers and forced her to participate. Though she filed a civil case (which was settled by Combs within one day), Ventura’s allegations appear to be the central foundation of the federal criminal case against Combs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four other cases were filed shortly thereafter, three by women who alleged that he raped them (in some cases drugging them), and one by a male music producer who accused Diddy of grooming him and coercing him to hire sex workers for sex. <br><br>After Combs’s arrest, a team of lawyers led by the law firms of Tony Buzbee and Andrew Van Arsdale put out a call looking for other potential victims, and announced that they would be proceeding with 120 additional civil lawsuits that would be filed in the weeks to come. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>If so many people were involved, why did it take so long for the allegations to come out?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Combs was incredibly powerful in the music industry and in American culture more generally. ​​&nbsp; He was one of the first people to blend the worlds of hip-hop, business, and luxury. His fashion label, Sean John, founded in 1998, became <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/09/sean-combs-puff-daddy-p-diddy-i-am-fashion">known for high-end menswear</a>. He promoted brands of vodka and tequila and hosted exclusive <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/diddy-white-party-turns-20-pictures-hamptons-8342051/">white parties</a> in the Hamptons with guests like Martha Stewart, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, and Jay Z.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s difficult for people to speak out about sexual assault under any circumstances, and doubly difficult when the alleged perpetrator is someone wealthy and well-connected who may have influence over their careers. Combs is also accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html">running an enormous criminal “enterprise”</a> that threatened women with blackmail and violence — including using firearms to threaten victims — all of which would have made it even more difficult for anyone to come forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s on the tapes mentioned in the indictment? Will they ever come out?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several of the accusers, and the criminal indictment, allege that Diddy videotaped sexual assaults and the performances with sex workers. The accuser this week alleges that a tape made of her sexual assault <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sean-diddy-combs-accuser-drugged-bound-rape-lawsuit-1235109972/">was sold</a> and viewed by several other men.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Generally, accusers have said any tapes served as a way to ensure their silence. In court, the New York Times reported, prosecutors presented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html">a statement from one</a> who said, “He just threatened me about my sex tapes that he has of me on two phones. He said he would expose me, mind you these sex tapes where I am heavily drugged.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is everyone talking about baby oil? Is this real?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the odder details in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/8a5e00b3-6871-456f-b787-736298a5c2d7.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_6">the Combs indictment</a> is that authorities say they seized “more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant” in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/25/entertainment/sean-combs-home-search/index.html">searches of the mogul’s residences</a> in Miami and Los Angeles earlier this year. Prosecutors say the oil was meant for the performances, and Ventura also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html">said in her lawsuit</a> that she was told to pour “excessive” amounts of oil on herself at these events.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Possessing baby oil is not a crime, and the whole oil issue doesn’t matter very much in the context of the violent and disturbing conduct of which Combs has been accused. But a federal indictment of a public figure like Combs is meant to be read, and it’s not unusual for prosecutors to include details they know will shock people and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html">make headlines</a>. Baby oil did the trick.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are other celebrities connected to the case?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s important to note that no other person, celebrity or not, has been indicted alongside Combs in the criminal case. The civil cases filed so far<strong> </strong>do not mention any other celebrities either, accusing only Combs and occasionally those employed by him.  <br><br>But with the announcement on October 1 of the additional 120 civil lawsuits, lawyers told the media that the cases would include a number of codefendants. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/10/01/diddy-sexual-assault-lawsuit-victims-tony-buzbee/">According to the Washington Post, </a>they claimed that those codefendants would include “members of Combs’s family, record labels, event venues and Combs’s associates,”  and that the list would include “household names.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, this is an incredibly tough question, tending to spark more rumor and innuendo than uncover any truths, as onlookers try to determine who knew what when. Indeed, Combs had many friends in high places. But pursuing the question tends to spawn misinformation, like a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/viral-justin-bieber-song-about-diddy-party-likely-ai/">viral song about “a Diddy party”</a> attributed to Justin Bieber that experts now say was likely created by AI.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, a few bold-faced names who were on the guest lists at Combs’s celeb-packed “<a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/09/23/celebrity-news/inside-sean-diddy-combs-wild-parties-leonardo-dicaprio-sarah-jessica-parker-j-lo-more-spotted-in-resurfaced-pics/">white parties</a>” have <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/what-celebs-have-said-about-diddys-infamous-parties/">come forward to say they</a> were in no way connected to any of the crimes Combs is accused of. But it’s best if we all give the conspiracy theories a rest, wait for legal filings to learn more, and let the case be handled in court. Wild speculation is only liable to exacerbate the victims’ pain.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What will happen to Combs’s businesses and brands now?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the weeks before Ventura’s lawsuit went public last November, Diddy made several media-grabbing moves, including donating $1 million to Howard University, performing and collecting a Global Icon Award at the VMAs, and throwing a high-profile birthday party for himself in London with Naomi Campbell and Idris Elba among the guests.<br><br>So much has since crumbled, not the least of which is his business empire. Diageo, the beverage brand with which Combs once partnered on vodka and tequila, quickly removed his image from its website, and the partnership broke ties after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/diddy-diageo-tequila-deleon-ciroc-3b554f9d03e007139484a6c7e0cf5bd4">settling a lawsuit</a> over another matter this January. Capital Preparatory Schools, a New York charter school network Combs helped expand, posted a statement on the school’s website last fall saying it was cutting ties with him (though the statement was later removed). Combs also stepped aside as chair of Revolt, a TV network he helped start in 2013, and then officially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-sell-stake-revolt.html">sold his stake</a> this summer. And Sean John’s website, according to the Daily Beast, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/sean-combs-scandal-fallout-diddys-couture-website-sean-john-has-gone-totally-offline">was taken down</a>.<br><br>According to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/sean-diddy-combs-dropped-steps-down-lawsuit.html">New York magazine</a>, he also no longer has a dedicated “Sean Diddy Combs Day” in Miami, returned his key to New York City, and had his planned Hulu show iced.<br><br>As for Howard, his alma mater? It returned the million-dollar gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If<strong> Diddy is convicted, how long could he be in prison?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no guarantee that Combs’s case will go to trial or that he’ll be convicted if he does, so at this point it’s impossible to guess the outcome. But the Department of Justice has issued a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/sean-combs-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-and-other-federal-offenses">list of the charges</a> against Combs and what each could mean if he’s convicted. Unsurprisingly, the maximum sentences range, with a transportation for purposes of prostitution charge bringing a potential 10-year sentence, and that racketeering conspiracy charge meaning Combs could face life in prison. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, October 1, 4:30 pm: </em></strong><em>This piece was originally published on September 26 and has been updated to include an additional 120 civil lawsuits filed against Combs and various codefendants. </em></p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has begun a military invasion of Lebanon it said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/30/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/">would be “limited,”</a> following days of bombing campaigns near and within the capital, Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share">said</a> that it had moved one army division, typically numbering around 10,000 troops, to the Lebanese border and told Lebanese civilians in about two dozen villages in the area to move north.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That invasion marks a dangerous new phase in the long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Islamist militant organization and Lebanese political party, that has fought Israel since its founding decades ago. Israel has recently escalated its attacks on Hezbollah, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group">assassinating the group’s reclusive leader</a>, Hassan Nasrallah, in a bombing in a Beirut suburb on Friday after reportedly launching a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">series of attacks on thousands of mobile devices</a> used by members of Hezbollah throughout Lebanon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s latest operations have been costly: More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/israel-strikes-yemen-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-middle-east-war-latest">1,000 Lebanese have been killed, 6,000 wounded</a>, and as many as a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o">million displaced</a> in recent weeks, according to Lebanese government officials. Hezbollah’s recent attacks on Israel — largely missile strikes — have meanwhile left at least <a href="https://www.jns.org/idf-probing-cause-of-sirens-in-central-israel/">eight</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24452/hezbollah-fires-missile-tel-aviv">people</a> wounded in the last week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the two sides have fought on and off over the decades, Hezbollah has been engaged in more intense fighting with Israel since the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas last year. Hezbollah has vowed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas/here-are-the-latest-developments-on-strikes-in-lebanon?smid=url-share">continue its missile strikes</a> into Israeli territory until Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza, where at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/">40,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed. Israel has shown no sign it is contemplating ending its operations, either. The country’s leaders have said they want to <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/352059/why-israel-cant-destroy-hamas">completely eradicate Hamas</a>, and Israel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/us-looks-unable-to-talk-netanyahu-out-of-planned-invasion-of-lebanon">defense minister said Monday</a> that the “next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Key allies also seem unable to end the fighting. The United States reportedly had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html">Hezbollah-Israel peace plan that they’ve now abandoned</a>. While the US has publicly told Israel it should try to deescalate the situation, the US <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/us-israel-military-hezbollah-00181797">reportedly privately offered Israel support</a> for its Hezbollah strategy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Iranian officials have responded to Israel’s recent attacks with a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-launched-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-rcna173434">ballistic missile strike</a> on Tuesday. Iran’s mission to the UN suggested the country did not have further attacks in store, <a href="https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106">writing on X</a> that the country’s “response … has been duly carried out,” though it added the threat: “Should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is what we do know so far about what has happened, and what’s likely to come next.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animosity between Hezbollah and Israel is decades old; in fact, Hezbollah formed in <a href="https://merip.org/1982/09/the-war-in-lebanon/">1982 in southern Lebanon</a> as a response to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/6/4/a-cosmic-stink-israels-invasion-of-lebanon-40-years-on">Israel’</a>s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/03/war-casualties-put-at-48000-in-lebanon/cf593941-6067-4239-a453-71bdcaf9eba0/">disastrous invasion</a>, which killed tens of thousands of Lebanese, and subsequent decades-long occupation of that area. Hezbollah <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/24/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon">waged guerilla warfare against Israeli troops for decades</a>, and Israel finally left in 2000 following years of brutal fighting and a UN resolution requiring them to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two sides settled into a conflict that simmered until 2006. After Hezbollah killed eight Israeli soldiers and captured two others, Israel responded with a counterattack that led to a short, bloody war in which <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/echoes-of-2006-israel-hezbollah-and-the-potential-for-regional-war/">more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis were killed</a>.<strong> </strong>A UN-brokered ceasefire ended that conflict, but fighting continued for years — and it intensified again in the wake of Hamas’s October 7 attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, and, starting on October 8, 2023, began firing major salvos into northern Israel, eventually displacing around <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglkkrj94ldo">60,000 residents there</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Initially, with Israel focused on uprooting Hamas in Gaza, fighting along its northern border with Lebanon was limited to tit-for-tat strikes. But starting in September, Israel escalated the fighting significantly, first by attacking Hezbollah members and leadership with exploding electronics, then bombing Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Lebanon and the outskirts of Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ever since the October 7 attack, observers have warned about the possibility that Israel’s war with Gaza might spread to encompass Hezbollah, and, perhaps, the entire region.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear if that’s what’s happening now, or what a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah might look like. Despite Hezbollah’s previous ability to stand up to Israeli firepower, it’s also not clear how it will fare with its communication networks disrupted by <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372772/hezbollah-israel-pagers-radios-lebanon">the recent pager and walkie-talkie attacks</a> —&nbsp;which Israel has not claimed, but is widely assumed to be behind. What’s more, a significant number of mid-level and senior Hezbollah leaders were killed in that attack and <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/373428/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-hamas-gaza">subsequent bombings</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What might Hezbollah’s next move be?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is considered the most widely armed and powerful militia group in the Middle East. It boasts a vast weapons arsenal, including as many as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/20/hezbollah-to-israel-precision-missiles-now-obtained">120,000 missiles</a>, and has deployed it with increasing success inside Israel’s borders since the war in Gaza began. Israel <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollahs-tunnels-flexible-command-weather-israels-deadly-blows-2024-09-25/">claims to have destroyed thousands of the group’s rockets and shells</a>, and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/people/natan-sachs/">Natan Sachs</a>, director of the Middle East policy program at the Brookings Institution, says Israel may have destroyed some of Hezbollah’s precision munitions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Hezbollah has demonstrated advanced military tactics such as <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hezbollah-introduces-new-weapons-tactics-against-israel-as-war-in-gaza-drags-on">using drones to fire missiles at key Israeli targets</a> and effective intelligence capabilities including <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tool-of-first-resort-israel-hamas-war-in-cyber/">digital espionage</a>. And recent Israeli attacks on Lebanese mobile devices and the assassination of Nasrallah haven’t completely wiped out that capacity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There was kind of this gleefulness about Hezbollah being completely disabled and destroyed now because all the leadership’s gone,” said <a href="https://x.com/phillipsmyth?lang=en">Phillip Smyth</a>, an independent analyst focusing on the Middle East and terrorism. “That’s not how it works.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the success of recent Israeli attacks has called into question the extent of Hezbollah’s capabilities — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah.html">reportedly shaken Iranian leadership</a>. In that sense, Hezbollah may have limited options going forward, even though it had previously pledged not to relent until a ceasefire in Gaza is reached.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Hezbollah turns out to be less capable, militarily, than I expected,” <a href="https://tcf.org/experts/thanassis-cambanis/">Thanassis Cambanis</a>, a senior fellow and director of the think tank Century International, said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cambanis and other experts believed that Hezbollah had the technology to effectively strike military targets in Israel, as well as civilian infrastructure in Haifa and even Tel Aviv, a major population center. But if it was willing and able, it seems it would have done so by now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It turns out that Hezbollah wasn’t willing to use its most powerful military options, or that it couldn’t because Israel was able to infiltrate or neutralize Hezbollah capabilities,” Cambanis said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The group’s second-in-command, Naim Qassem, sought to dispel doubts about Hezbollah’s capabilities in a speech on Monday, though he also seemed to suggest Hezbollah is currently on the defensive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Israel was not able to reach our military capabilities, and what its media says about hitting most of the medium and long-range capabilities is a dream they have not achieved and will never achieve,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ">Qassem said</a>. “We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He added that an announcement will be <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-says-choose-nasrallahs-successor-at-earliest-opportunity">made in the coming days</a> about Nasrallah’s successor, who Smyth said will most likely be <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-822451">Hashem Safieddine</a>, Nasrallah’s handpicked heir and cousin. Safieddine currently oversees&nbsp; Hezbollah’s political affairs and sits on the council managing the group’s military operations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Iran’s role here?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tuesday’s missile barrage is Iran’s most escalatory move since April, when the regime sent around 300 missiles and rockets toward Israel, nearly all of which were intercepted by US and regional partner forces, as well as Israel’s own air defenses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the most part, Iran asserts its regional power and carries out foreign policy goals —&nbsp;primarily, antagonizing Israel —&nbsp;by funding and providing resources to a network of militia groups. Those include Hamas, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Shia militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and, of course, Hezbollah.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Iran’s relationship with Hezbollah is really like two NATO allies,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/14/23917078/israel-hamas-war-gaza-iran-hezbollah-khamenei-lebanon">told Vox</a> last October.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, while NATO allies pledge to defend one another from attacks, Iran has been reluctant to be actively involved in a war against Israel; a drone attack on Israeli territory in April, following the assassination of an Iranian military leader in an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus, Syria, was obviously telegraphed and minimally destructive. And the July assassination of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, the former Hamas leader, while he was in Tehran prompted no obvious retaliation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not to say that Iran has no appetite for conflict: “The appetite for them was quite high, to be perfectly frank,” Smyth said.&nbsp;“They just thought that they could micromanage this so that it wouldn’t get to this point. And the Israelis clearly called their bluff.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, it seems, Iran has offered a show of force — but there are limits to how far the country will go.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Escalation could come, but [the Iranians] need to thread a needle,” Sachs said. That involves trying to show solidarity with Hezbollah and that Iran is capable of attack, without getting into an extended war with both Israel and the US.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Israel’s Lebanon campaign a prelude to a larger ground invasion?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s plan for its “limited” ground invasion involves rooting out Hezbollah along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel to neutralize the threat to Israeli communities nearby, the <a href="https://wapo.st/3XO98KS">Washington Post reported</a>. So far, the Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share">said</a> it has conducted “limited, localized and targeted raids” along the border.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s a fear that Israel’s narrow mission could balloon into something bigger — much as it already has in Gaza, where Israel’s stated operational objective of eliminating Hamas has given way to widespread destruction of civilian life. If the conflict with Hezbollah does grow, that would likely spur fierce Lebanese resistance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“An invasion of Lebanon will mobilize Lebanese as a national issue to resist, including the many Lebanese who don’t support Israel but also oppose another Israeli invasion and occupation,” Cambanis said. “Perhaps in the short term Israel can achieve some of its aims by pursuing the logic of total war, but it will only make Israel and the entire Middle East less safe.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Lebanese government — or what passes for it, since an unelected caretaker government has been in place since 2022 — has clearly demonstrated that the country is not interested in yet another war with Israel. Caretaker <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-hold-session-elect-president-after-ceasefire-caretaker-pm-says-2024-09-30/">Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced Monday</a> that his government is prepared to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war. That resolution would deploy the Lebanese army to the country’s south to crack down on Hezbollah and require Israel to pull out of southern Lebanon. Now that Israel has entered Lebanon, it’s unclear whether Mikati will trigger the resolution. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conflict has already taken a significant toll on Lebanese civilians and it could only get worse from here. In anticipation, Lebanon and the United Nations petitioned for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/23dd80ed-e9dd-5ee3-a552-622fbac870f6?smid=url-share">$426 million</a> in humanitarian aid on Tuesday to help those affected in the next three months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lebanon has already struggled under decades of war and government dysfunction, as well as an influx of Syrian refugees that have stretched already-limited state capacity. Now, Israel’s bombing attacks and invasion have displaced around 1 million Lebanese from the south of the country, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o">according to Mikati</a>, and the Lebanese government says <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-30-2024-83ea5f243688f309754ec74850de4238">at least 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s next for the Gaza-Hezbollah-Israel conflict overall?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There seems to be no end in sight for the widening conflict, for several reasons: US unwillingness to restrain Israel by restricting weapons shipments; Hezbollah’s stated position that they will not stop attacks on Israel until a ceasefire with Gaza is reached; and the repeated breakdown of Gaza ceasefire talks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US and France did attempt to negotiate a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/26/lebanon-temporary-ceasefire-plan-hezbollah-israel">21-day ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel last week</a>, but “Israel (Netanyahu) has flat out rejected the US-French 21 day ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,” <a href="https://history.stanford.edu/people/joel-beinin">Joel Beinin</a>, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University, said. As Hezbollah also frames its attacks as support for Gaza, it most likely won’t agree to a ceasefire as long as Gaza is still under attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the US, there seems to be almost no effort to truly restrain Israel following the failed ceasefire attempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The United States is just not driving events,” <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/michael-wahid-hanna">Michael Hanna</a>, director of the US program at the International Crisis Group, said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We support Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah and all Iranian backed terror groups. Of course, we know that mission creep can be a risk and we will keep discussing that with the Israelis. And ultimately, a diplomatic resolution is the only way to achieve lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border,” a spokesperson from the National Security Council told Vox in an email.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US could, however, do more to deter escalation; <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/in-the-news/bernie-sanders-preparing-resolutions-to-block-20b-in-us-arms-sales-to-israel/">Sen. Bernie Sanders </a>(I-VT) has introduced <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-resolution-forces-vote-arms-sales-israel-gaza_n_66f5b5a4e4b0b663235fb66d">a resolution to block arms sales to Israel</a>, on the premise that the arms transfers violate international law, although that is unlikely to pass in Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Lebanon is the current site of the crisis, Israeli military operations are ongoing in Gaza, where <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20240711-more-than-186-000-dead-in-gaza-how-credible-are-the-estimates-published-on-the-lancet">as many as 186,000 people may have been killed in the past year of fighting</a>, according to the Lancet, a medical journal. (Many media sources put that figure at 40,000, but an accurate count is difficult given that much of Gaza is destroyed and fighting is ongoing.) Medical infrastructure has been destroyed, and there are many reported instances of communicable disease and malnutrition.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are getting killed in Gaza daily, the humanitarian situation is dire,” Hanna said. “Life is disrupted and on hold — there are no schools, there’s no functioning society. There’s nothing.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel appears to be emboldened by its victories, and Hezbollah appears reluctant to launch large-scale attacks on Israel. The US has maintained its support for Israel and is sending <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-troops-middle-east-israel-hezbollah-e37e2dbef573e33c0f8fb6a8103f27f1">more troops to the region</a>. Iran has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-mideast-tensions-hezbollah-lebanon-analysis-5020aeed3c88790d5483fdf40c9ba392">issued some threats</a>, but hasn’t yet been much of an active participant in the fighting. All that makes it impossible to say where the war goes from here. Cambanis, however, predicts the worst.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s a dangerous and delusional march to war on Iran,” he said. “I would have liked to rely on the US government to restrain Israel, but it’s clear that the Biden administration supports Israel’s widening gyre of escalation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The vice presidential candidates — Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — are set to face off Tuesday night in the first and only scheduled vice presidential debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle. The stakes are high. Vance and Walz have just 34 days left to make their pitches to voters across the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest oddity of VP debates is that, while the running mates are onstage, it’s the presidential nominees who get the lion’s share of attention. Vance and Walz will be onstage to talk up their candidate — and run down the other party’s. Vance has spent months hitting Vice President Kamala Harris on her record on the border and immigration. Walz, meanwhile, has hit Vance and former President Donald Trump on their opposition to reproductive rights, tying them to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">highly unpopular Project 2025</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What you can do right now</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the immediate aftermath of the storm, do not send donations or supplies that have not been specifically requested by state and local organizations, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. In <a href="https://x.com/tennesseeema/status/1840439256327827927?s=46">a statement on X</a>, TEMA said it is not accepting volunteers or donations “until the life safety mission is complete.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While local communities appreciate the volunteer spirit during disasters, please DO NOT send donations that have not been requested by state or local authorities.<br><br>TEMA is not accepting volunteers or donations until the life safety mission is complete. Tennesseans, do not… <a href="https://t.co/EhrIcewCLX">pic.twitter.com/EhrIcewCLX</a></p>&mdash; Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) (@TennesseeEMA) <a href="https://twitter.com/TennesseeEMA/status/1840439256327827927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While well-meaning, donating supplies can “further burden a community that is already in crisis,” <a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/recover/volunteer-donate">according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>. If you are local to the areas impacted by Helene, connect with established local or national charitable organizations to ensure you’re donating exactly what is needed and in the necessary quantities (usually in bulk). Used clothing is never necessary, per FEMA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">North Carolina Emergency Management <a href="https://x.com/NCEmergency/status/1840456630095184040">advised against traveling to western North Carolina</a> in order to keep roads cleared for rescue and utility crews. If you have a trip planned to an affected community in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, consider delaying or canceling your trip: <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/368920/what-to-do-natural-disaster-vacation-travel-earthquake-wildfire-hurricane-flooding">tourists may complicate search and rescue efforts.</a> The state also asks that people <a href="https://www.ncdps.gov/our-organization/emergency-management/hurricane-helene#ThestormhasnowendedandmyhomeorcommunityhasdamageWhatisnext-8119">do not send physical donations and volunteers</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">⚠️ DO NOT travel to western NC. Rescue crews are continuing to work in impacted areas. Utility crews are also at work to restore power, cell service and other vital infrastructure. Keep the roads clear for them.</p>&mdash; NC Emergency Management (@NCEmergency) <a href="https://twitter.com/NCEmergency/status/1840456630095184040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The best way to offer your support after a disaster is to <a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/recover/volunteer-donate">donate money</a>, according to FEMA. “Organizations on the ground know what items and quantities are needed, often buy in bulk with discounts and, if possible, purchase through businesses local to the disaster, which supports economic recovery,” the agency’s website says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are some organizations where you can donate funds:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://easttennesseefoundation.org/grants/neighbor-to-neighbor-disaster-relief-fund/">fund with the East Tennessee Foundation</a> supports local nonprofits and agencies dedicated to rescue and recovery.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Local chapters of the national coalition <a href="https://www.nvoad.org/hurricane-helene-response/">Voluntary Organizations Active In Disaster</a> are asking for only cash donations for recovery efforts in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://pay.payitgov.com/ncdonations">North Carolina Disaster Relief Fund</a> helps with the “unmet needs of hurricane victims.”</li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.volunteerflorida.org/donatefdf/">Florida Disaster Fund</a> supports response and recovery activities in the state.</li>



<li><a href="https://give.helpsalvationarmy.org/give/166081/#!/donation/checkout">Donations to the Salvation Army</a> will go to the distribution of emergency aid, food, and critical supplies to survivors and rescue workers in impacted states.&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://support.unitedway.org/page/Helene">Donate to the United Way,</a> where funds will be distributed to local chapters for recovery efforts.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/">Feeding America</a> is collecting funds to provide meals and supplies to impacted areas.</li>



<li>Donations are being accepted at <a href="https://my.americares.org/give/623680#!/donation/checkout">Americares</a> to deliver medicines and supplies to victims of the storm.</li>



<li>GoFundMe is <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/enxh8-hurricane-relief-fund">organizing its own fundraiser</a> for disaster relief efforts.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To avoid charity scams, research organizations you plan to give to and avoid donating to ones that have <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/features/donating-safely-and-avoiding-scams">obvious red flags</a> such as rushing you into making a donation or asking you to donate via gift card or by wiring money. <a href="http://give.org">Give.org</a> and <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/">Charity Navigator</a> provide trustworthiness ratings for many charitable groups.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What you can do in the weeks and months ahead</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do not go to a disaster area to volunteer. Until a disaster area has been declared safe to enter and volunteer needs are identified, stay home and donate instead. Volunteers should only come once they have been given an assignment with an established organization that has asked for assistance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Volunteers will be <a href="https://www.nvoad.org/volunteer/">needed in the months following a disaster</a>, according to Voluntary Organizations Active In Disaster, so be patient. You can check for opportunities at <a href="https://www.nvoad.org/volunteer/">the National Voluntary Organizations Active In Disaster</a>, which coordinates disaster response across a number of organizations nationwide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricane Helene, the Category 4 storm that slammed the American Southeast over the weekend, has killed more than 110 people — and likely millions of chickens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop20011/chap7.htm#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20over%201.2%20million,the%20Northeast%20at%208%20percent.">Almost half</a> of the more than <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">9 billion chickens</a> farmed for meat in the US, known as “broiler” chickens, are raised and slaughtered in the region. Georgia is the nation’s top chicken producer, processing <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/Ag_Overview/stateOverview.php?state=GEORGIA">1.3 billion chickens</a> annually. Over the weekend, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-30/hurricane-helene-halts-poultry-plants-damages-pecan-trees">told</a> reporters that 107 poultry facilities in the state had been “damaged or totally destroyed by the storm.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgia’s Department of Agriculture didn’t respond to questions about the precise number of chickens that perished during Hurricane Helene. But given that poultry companies typically pack anywhere from<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/fad-broilers-brooding">20,000</a> <a href="https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/farm-management/new-farmers-guide-to-the-commercial-broiler-industry-poultry-husbandry-biosecurity-basics/#:~:text=It%20is%20common%20for%20there,those%20birds%20have%20fewer%20chickens.">to 52,000 chickens</a> into each barn, which can run as big as nearly twice the length of a football field, an estimated 2.14 million to 5.56 million birds are likely to have died. (The true total could be modestly different, as some birds could’ve survived damages, and some barns could’ve been temporarily empty, as companies clear them out for a few weeks between flocks.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the nation’s largest poultry companies — including <a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/broilers-turkeys/article/15704638/us-poultry-industry-harshly-hit-by-hurricane-helene">Aviagen</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-30/hurricane-helene-halts-poultry-plants-damages-pecan-trees">Pilgrim’s Pride</a> and <a href="https://www.porkbusiness.com/news/industry/hurricane-helene-shutters-poultry-plants-smithfield-did-not-suffer-material">Wayne-Sanderson Farms</a> — suspended operations at their local facilities due to power outages in recent days. A spokesperson for Clemson University&#8217;s agriculture program told Vox that while this is a fluid situation and it is still evaluating the hurricane’s damages, 45,000 chickens died at one South Carolina poultry operation due to generator failure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Virtually all chickens raised for meat in the US are confined in these sprawling warehouses, which bear no resemblance to the small barns of America’s agricultural past. These factory farm operations often have at least several sheds, housing hundreds of thousands of birds on one site at the same time. If enough facilities are compromised during a natural disaster like Hurricane Helene, millions of animals can perish, their last moments likely frightening and painful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their deaths also threaten the economic health of farmers and the poultry industry. Georgia’s agriculture commissioner, Tyler Harper, has <a href="https://agr.georgia.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-response/9-29-24-hurricane-helene-emergency-appropriations-letter.pdf">requested</a> immediate federal relief for the state’s agricultural sector.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When hurricanes strike factory farms, they can also flush untold amounts of animal manure into groundwater or rivers and streams, exacerbating the challenges that governments and their residents face in the wake of pounding storms.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/7Xyjx-factory-farm-animals-release-nearly-1-trillion-pounds-of-manure-annually-that-s-twice-as-much-as-humans-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,17.604058897911,100,64.791882204178" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricane Helene is the latest — but not the first — striking, high-stakes example of how our factory farming system imposes tremendous cruelty onto animals and also imperils human health. The industry has no reason to change, even after a catastrophe like this, because taxpayers cover much of the economic loss meat companies incur from natural disasters.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How taxpayers subsidize factory farming’s risks</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is far from the first time a hurricane has torn through the Southeast’s poultry industry. It’s happened multiple times over the last quarter-century, a period in which Big Ag has only <a href="https://www.ewg.org/research/innovative-ewg-study-uses-ai-find-357m-poultry-north-carolinas-factory-farms">doubled down</a> on building more, and bigger, factory farms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1999, Hurricane Floyd put much of eastern North Carolina underwater, killing an <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ilm/floyd">estimated</a> 2.4 million chickens, 100,000 pigs, and half a million turkeys. North Carolina pig farms store the animals’ waste in giant manure “lagoons,” and several <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/22/650698240/hurricane-s-aftermath-floods-hog-lagoons-in-north-carolina#:~:text=In%201999%2C%20flooding%20from%20Hurricane,to%20The%20New%20York%20Times.&amp;text=Hurricane%20Floyd%20forced%20North%20Carolina%20to%20make%20changes.">overflowed</a> during Floyd, sending toxic sludge containing bacteria and viruses (including <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/29/17517906/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-over">E. coli</a>) into waterways and drinking water, <a href="https://climate.ncsu.edu/blog/2019/09/farmers-felt-floyds-full-force-beginning-in-onslow-county/">according</a> to the state’s climate office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chicken factory farms store manure in giant pits or as large mounds, creating a similar pollution risk as hog farms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2016/10/25/post-matthew-water-how-bad-is-it/">Hurricane Matthew</a> in 2016 and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/21/hurricane-florence-flooding-north-carolina">Hurricane Florence</a> in 2018 also caused devastation in North Carolina, killing millions of chickens and thousands of pigs, both of which caused damage to some manure lagoons, resulting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/21/hurricane-florence-flooding-north-carolina">“fecal soup”</a> discharge. Later the same year, Hurricane Michael <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220212232153/http://agr.georgia.gov/hurricane-michael-devastates-georgias-agricultural-industry.aspx">destroyed</a> over 80 chicken barns in Georgia that housed more than 2 million chickens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Manure can seep into groundwater and contaminate private wells that many rural communities rely on for drinking water, a perennial concern <a href="https://hazards.colorado.edu/article/hogs-and-hurricanes-while-flood-water-recedes-animal-waste-pollution-doesn-t">heightened</a> after major storms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1037412200.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729273205801,100,78.541453588399" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A flooded hog farm in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in 2018. | Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images" /><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/WAM7693.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.669135487166,100,78.661729025667" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Farmed chickens died in the flooding in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in 2018. | Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals" data-portal-copyright="Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite that history, the poultry and pork industries haven’t done much to mitigate the risks posed by natural disasters by, say, raising fewer animals on their farms or making major changes to how they manage the enormous amounts of manure their animals generate. That’s because US taxpayers bear much of the cost, both for the environmental cleanup and the dead chickens and pigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When natural disasters hit a typical chicken farm, the meat company — which technically owns the chickens, not the farmer — receives <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/2024/fsa_lip_livestock_3_2024.pdf">$3 per mature bird</a> from the US Department of Agriculture, about 75 percent of the bird’s market value. The farmer that supplies to the meatpacker receives just 33 cents per bird.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many chicken farmers, most of whom raise birds on a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23207301/costco-rotisserie-chicken-poultry-farming-inflation">contract basis</a> for meat companies, are already toiling in precarious economic conditions. Hurricanes and other natural disasters can make it much worse.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The federal government also reimburses economic losses from other severe weather, like heat waves and cold snaps, and disease outbreaks. Over the last two years, a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu — known as H5N1 — has resulted in the death of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html">more than 100 million</a> poultry birds, and the federal government has given well over <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/usda-has-spent-usd1-billion-fighting-bird-flu-8424034#:~:text=Since%20bird%20flu%20outbreaks%20began,Health%20Inspection%20Service%20on%20Monday.">$1 billion</a> to the poultry industry, much of it going to the largest companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Livestock production is both a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf">leading driver of climate change</a> and, as Hurricane Helene demonstrates, a victim of it. As global warming increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, policymakers should question the factory farming model. Instead, as a recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">federal accounting</a> of the US agricultural system shows, we’re doubling down on it, raising more and more animals on bigger and bigger farms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In addition to all the environmental problems associated with the factory farm model, and the public health problems that it causes, at the end of the day the extreme concentration of animals is just a fundamental vulnerability,” said Chris Hunt, deputy director of the nonprofit Socially Responsible Agriculture Project. “It’s a vulnerability to unexpected shocks to the system … The fact that poultry is not only concentrated on [factory farms], but is also concentrated geographically, is certainly problematic.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The scenes from North Carolina are shocking: roads and bridges washed away. Houses ripped from their foundations. Entire towns reduced to mud and debris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday night, Hurricane Helene slammed Florida as a Category 4 storm with winds reaching 140 miles per hour. Along the coast, Helene knocked down trees and power lines, and caused <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/28/helene-storm-surge-city-impact/">record storm surge</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet some of its most devastating impacts were farther inland as the storm moved across the Southeast. Even before the bulk of the storm arrived in North Carolina, Helene started dumping rain in southern Appalachia —&nbsp;and loads of it. Over the last several days some regions in western North Carolina, near the city of Asheville, recorded more than <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawFnj-FleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHQqOqR_oagJDph7eil_N509txd3OqBKDRXp32EW-RoBFI7FQBsXg0QAghg_aem_P0uioRN-URPjEzaFxpwkmA">2.5 feet</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have biblical devastation through the county,” Ryan Cole, the assistant director of Buncombe County Emergency Services, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/UsLVoZt8WvSfqi4y/">said</a> in a press briefing Saturday afternoon. “We’ve had biblical flooding here.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far at least <a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-helene-florida-north-carolina-georgia-09-30-24/index.html">130 deaths</a> are linked to Helene across six states, including Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. That number is almost certain to rise. Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for, in part because millions of households have lost power and there are still widespread cell outages. Many roads are also inaccessible, making rescue operations challenging.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stunned by the devastation, some residents <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/28/helene-flooding-carolinas-tennessee-destruction/">have compared</a> flooding in parts of North Carolina to the impacts from Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall in Louisiana in 2005. Katrina claimed <a href="https://www.weather.gov/mob/katrina">more than 1,800 lives</a>. In the weeks to come, Helene may become one of the deadliest US hurricanes in recent history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Helene is yet another reminder that climate change — which can intensify hurricanes and flooding — costs human lives. Record-warm water in the Gulf of Mexico <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/373874/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-warm-ocean-water">supercharged the storm</a> and loaded it with moisture. Generally speaking, hot air also holds more water. Together these dynamics helped turn Helene into a deadly, super-wet storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And as these last few days have revealed, it’s not just coastal communities that are vulnerable. Asheville <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2022/08/dubbed-a-climate-haven-a-north-carolina-community-braces-itself/">has been dubbed a climate haven</a> —&nbsp;a refuge from the impacts of warming and its consequences. But in reality, few places are completely safe.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2174887967.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The main street in Tarpon Springs, Florida inundated with water on September 27. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Joe Raedle/Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">1) How bad is the damage?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helene’s path of destruction began in the eastern Caribbean, where the storm formed early last week. Helene brushed Cancun as a tropical storm, flooding the streets and downing trees, before churning across the warm Gulf of Mexico and intensifying into a major hurricane. On Thursday evening, it slammed into the Big Bend of Florida —&nbsp;the region where the panhandle meets the peninsula —&nbsp;as a Category 4 storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Landfall caused record-breaking storm surge, a rise in sea level, along parts of Florida’s Gulf Coast, including in Tampa Bay and the small island of Cedar Key. Some areas saw water levels rise 15 feet above ground level, according to <a href="https://x.com/NHC_Surge/status/1839677998880227563">preliminary modeling</a> by the National Hurricane Center.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The storm left Florida <a href="https://x.com/VortixWx/status/1840740671667228942">homes in ruins</a>. Officials estimate that Helene destroyed around a quarter of all homes on Cedar Key, which lies about 130 miles north of Tampa, <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2024/09/29/reality-of-hurricanes-devastation-setting-in-along-with-relief/75430622007/">according to</a> the Palm Beach Post.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of the worst damage, however, was in regions less familiar with the threat of tropical storms: the mountains of Georgia, Tennessee, and especially North Carolina. The main problem in the southeastern US was abundant, unceasing rain, which began falling before Helene made landfall in Florida. It caused rivers to swell in populated areas like Atlanta and Asheville. Asheville is the largest city in western North Carolina, with roughly 95,000 residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Videos and images over the weekend showed much of Asheville’s River Arts District —&nbsp;which hugs the French Broad River, southwest of downtown —&nbsp;utterly inundated with water, which nearly submerged buildings. Many of the shops and businesses, which are a lifeblood of the region, are unsalvageable, Will Hofmann, of the Asheville Citizen Times, <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/09/29/tropical-storm-helene-floods-wipe-out-asheville-river-arts-district/75433499007/">reports</a>. In Buncombe County, which envelops Asheville, 40 people have died due to the storm and its impacts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">State officials <a href="https://drivenc.gov/">said</a> all roads in western North Carolina, including parts of Interstate 40, were closed and should only be used by emergency vehicles. In nearby Tennessee, meanwhile, more than a dozen bridges are closed and five of them “are completely gone,” the state’s Department of Transportation <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/keWHTMT8dia6dF6g/">said</a> Sunday.&nbsp;Many roads and areas in Great Smoky Mountains National Park are also <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/conditions.htm">closed</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Power outages and water shortages are also rampant across the Southeast. As of late Tuesday morning, more than 1.5 million people were without electricity across South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, and Virginia, according to <a href="http://poweroutage.us">PowerOutage.us</a>. Parts of western North Carolina are under a boil water advisory, due to a disruption in the public water supply. Repairs to Asheville’s water system could take weeks, <a href="https://www.ashevillenc.gov/news/tropical-storm-helene-recovery-resources/">officials said</a>. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2173905556.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736293776186,100,78.527412447627" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Rainwater filled the streets of Atlanta, Georgia on September 27. | Megan Varner/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Megan Varner/Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">2) How much will the storm cost?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, it will take weeks to get a full tally of all the damage, though initial estimates suggest it will be in the billions of dollars. <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/press-releases/corelogic-hurricane-helene-wind-storm-surge-cause-an-initial-estimated-3-5-billion-in-insured-losses/">CoreLogic</a>, an analytics firm, put its initial tally between $3 billion and $5 billion in insured losses. <a href="https://www.theinsurer.com/news/moodys-analytics-says-helene-like-idalia-but-worse-with-cost-estimated-at-up-to-34bn/">Moody’s Analytics</a> expects a toll from $20 billion to $34 billion. <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/helene-aftermath-dozens-dead-historic-flooding-millions-without-power-amid-catastrophic-destruction/1697545">AccuWeather</a>, meanwhile, is setting the price tag between $145 billion and $160 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These are all coarse initial estimates, but they indicate the magnitude of the devastation. The higher projections would put Helene in the top tier of costliest storms in the US. Hurricane Katrina, currently the most expensive weather disaster in US history, extracted about <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-633r">$170 billion from the economy</a>. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/08/hurricane-harvey-was-years-costliest-us-disaster-125-billion-damages/">Hurricane Harvey</a> in 2017 cost about $125.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The dollar value, however, doesn’t tell the whole story. Damage estimates are typically based on insurance claims, but with rising premiums across the country, more homes and businesses are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/06/23/americans-not-buying-homeowners-insurance/74144566007/">not seeking financial protection</a>. The insured value of a property doesn’t directly translate into suffering, either. A multimillion-dollar coastal vacation home getting swept down a hillside will register as a higher loss on an insurance company’s balance sheet than a destroyed mobile home that’s the sole residence and store of wealth for a family.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">3) Why was flooding in North Carolina so extreme?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The simplest reason is that Helene was huge, stretching more than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-storm-size-miles/">more than 400 miles wide</a>, so its impacts —&nbsp;the wind and rain —&nbsp;reached well beyond the eye. Most hurricanes are around <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/tropical_stuff/hurricane_anatomy/hurricane_anatomy.html">300 miles in diameter</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more is that the storm crossed an exceptionally warm ocean before reaching the mainland. The evaporation of that warm ocean water, which sends columns of moisture into the atmosphere, is what fuels hurricanes, and loads them up with moisture that later falls as rain.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even before Helene made landfall in Florida, bands of moisture from the hurricane were pulled into Appalachia. Satellite imagery showed almost the entire East Coast shrouded in cloud cover. That means that some regions were already starting to flood even before the bulk of Helene arrived.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/1250x750.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,1.0066828416975,100,97.986634316605" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A satellite image taken on September 25. | NOAA" data-portal-copyright="NOAA" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Recent rainfall in these areas, especially the southern Appalachians, have left the grounds saturated and the river tributaries running high,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/communities-need-to-prepare-for-catastrophic-life-threatening-inland-flooding-from-helene-even-well">warned</a> last Wednesday. “Additional rainfall from Helene will exacerbate the existing flood risk.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth noting that this is a wet region of the country. The areas surrounding Asheville are temperate rainforests, full of streams and rivers that run alongside human communities.&nbsp;This underscores another point: The impacts of a storm are not simply a function of wind speed and rain totals. They’re also influenced by the amount of people and property in harm’s way and how ready they are to face a disaster.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">4) How does Helene compare to storms like Katrina and Harvey?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that Helene is already on course to join the ranks of the costliest storms in US history. What all those storms have in common is that they made landfall in the continental US at high intensities in populated areas: Harvey struck the Texas coast at <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/08/hurricane-harvey-was-years-costliest-us-disaster-125-billion-damages/">Category 4 strength</a>, Katrina rammed into Louisiana and Mississippi as a <a href="https://www.weather.gov/mob/katrina">Category 3 storm</a>, while Helene was a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/26/weather/video/landfall-hurricane-helene-storm-florida-john-berman-lcl-digvid">Category 4</a> when it hammered Florida’s Big Bend region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/29/22647117/hurricane-ida-categories-explained">hurricane category ranking system</a> is mainly based on wind speed, while the most dangerous element of these storms is the sheer quantity of water in the form of rainfall and storm surge. All three of these storms caused extensive flooding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their destruction also compounded on top of local vulnerabilities. Houston suffered intense flooding after Harvey because of the inordinate amount of rain it received, but also because the city is densely populated, relatively flat, and close to sea level. Sections of New Orleans sit below sea level and when Katrina struck, the city’s flood control infrastructure <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/orleans/how-nf.html">catastrophically failed</a>. Helene landed in Florida’s Big Bend region, which is still recovering <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23850601/hurricane-idalia-florida-wind-forecast-storm-surge-flood-rapid-intensification">from the last major hurricane</a>, before moving further inland and dumping rain on regions that have much less experience and infrastructure to cope with extraordinary volumes of water.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2024/05/07/population-growth-in-most-states-lags-long-term-trends">growing number of people</a> are also living in areas most likely to get hammered by hurricanes, and these states are building more property and infrastructure to accommodate them. That means that when a storm does make landfall, it puts more people in danger and damages more homes, offices, roads, and power lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">5) What is the government doing to help?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before Helene made landfall, forecasters at NOAA put out a <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/communities-need-to-prepare-for-catastrophic-life-threatening-inland-flooding-from-helene-even-well">rare news release and blunt warning</a> about the storm’s impending damage. The agency said that the hurricane would cause “catastrophic, life-threatening inland flooding.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The governors of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina heeded these alerts and submitted <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administrations-life-saving-and-life-sustaining-response-efforts-to-hurricane-helene/">emergency declaration requests</a> to the White House.&nbsp;Evacuation orders were issued for <a href="https://www.readync.gov/stay-informed/evacuation-orders">parts of North Carolina</a>, <a href="https://www.tn.gov/tema/news/2024/9/28/flash-report--5-hurricane-helene.html">Tennessee</a>, and <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/09/25/governor-ron-desantis-issues-updates-on-state-preparedness-efforts-ahead-of-hurricane-helene/">Florida</a>, but <a href="https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/taylor-county-sheriffs-office-birthday-on-body/77-d6ee689f-bac3-445d-acc0-a7ff258f958a">some residents didn’t obey them</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disaster declarations allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to get involved in the response with emergency shelters, medical aid, and grants for helping people recover. More than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/us/helene-destruction-florida-north-carolina.html">1,270 rescuers</a> were sent to the afflicted areas. States also <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/280098/national_guard_assists_with_hurricane_helene_response_in_southeast">mobilized National Guard units</a> to assist with rescue and relief efforts. During a press conference on Monday, President Joe Biden said<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538815-1/president-biden-remarks-federal-response-hurricane-helene"> he may have to call Congress back into session</a> to get more funding to help with the response. Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris altered their presidential <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-harris-change-campaign-plans-address-hurricane-helene/story?id=114346629">campaign schedules</a> in response to the hurricane.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/biden-pledges-help-for-helene-victims-for-as-long-as-it-takes-db864385">Trump criticized Biden</a> for not being in Washington, DC, during the storm, but Biden said he’s been following the situation and will visit areas hit hard by the disaster once rescue operations wind down. Trump is also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/29/trump-hurricane-helene-be-okay/">planning to visit Georgia</a> to get an update on the storm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ad hoc networks of local volunteers have also sprung up to provide assistance and relief, even <a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/sunday-helene-asheville-updates-death-toll-rises-schools-close-resources-coming">deploying private airplanes and helicopters</a> to bring supplies to areas now isolated by floods and destroyed roads.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">6) What did climate change have to do with it?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s uncommon —&nbsp;though not unheard of —&nbsp;for tropical storms to travel through southern Appalachia.&nbsp;As shown in the graphic below, several systems (or their remnants) have reached this region in the last few centuries.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-30-at-9.19.16 AM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.7980553477936,100,80.403889304413" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Tropical storms and hurricanes have run through western North Carolina in the past. | NOAA" data-portal-copyright="NOAA" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet it’s now well known that rising global temperatures can make the impacts of these storms much worse. Hotter air and water make the strongest hurricanes stronger and fuel <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/9/28/23376761/hurricane-ian-rapid-intensification-climate-change">rapid intensification</a>, where a storm’s winds pick up by 35 miles per hour or more in less than 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warmer air holds onto more moisture, which means that hurricanes dish out more rain. A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14oq65lavZ7ho3-gdxE-tutDEcsxSHfUj/view">rapid assessment</a> of Helene by scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests that climate change caused “over 50 percent more rainfall during Hurricane Helene in some parts of Georgia and the Carolinas.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We estimate that the observed rainfall was made up to 20 times more likely in these areas because of global warming,” the scientists wrote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A hotter climate also causes sea levels to rise —&nbsp;because warm water expands and also melts polar ice —&nbsp;which worsens the impact of storm surge. That tends to <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23850601/hurricane-idalia-florida-wind-forecast-storm-surge-flood-rapid-intensification">create more flooding</a> in the wake of a hurricane.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helene appeared in one of the hottest years on record, with ocean temperatures near record highs and atmospheric conditions that scientists say are <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific">suited for hurricane formation</a>. NOAA predicted that this year’s hurricane season would be <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season">above average</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Risks are only mounting for communities in the Southeast. According to the most recent <a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/22/">National Climate Assessment</a>, a US government report, growing populations in regions hit by Helene, particularly in cities, has created new vulnerabilities to warming. “Over the last few decades, economic growth in the Southeast has been concentrated in and around urban centers that depend on climate-sensitive infrastructure and regional connections to thrive,” the report states.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Tuesday, October 8, one day after the justices convene for a new Supreme Court term, the Court will hear a case that could <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/4/24/24138227/supreme-court-ghost-guns-background-checks-criminals-serial-numbers">open up a massive loophole in US gun laws</a>. The plaintiffs in <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/garland-v-vanderstok-2/"><em>Garland v. VanDerStok</em></a> ask the Court to effectively neutralize a federal law requiring gun buyers to submit to a background check, as well as a separate law requiring guns to have a serial number to allow law enforcement to track firearms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case involves “ghost guns,” weapons that are sold dismantled and in ready-to-assemble kits. Three Trump appointees on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit <a href="https://casetext.com/case/vanderstok-v-garland-2">previously concluded</a> that guns sold in these kits are exempt from the laws requiring background checks and serial numbers, thus making it easy for people with violent felony convictions to obtain guns simply by buying them in a disassembled state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By law, the background check and serial number <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921">requirements apply to</a> “any weapon &#8230; which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.” They also apply to “the frame or receiver of any such weapon,” the skeletal part of a gun that houses other components, such as the barrel or firing mechanism. Thus, if someone purchases a series of firearm parts intending to build a gun at home, they still must face a background check when they purchase the gun’s frame or receiver.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ghost gun makers seek to evade these requirements by selling a kit with an incomplete frame or receiver — although, according to the Justice Department, it’s often <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-852/315742/20240625172334020_23-852%20VanDerStok.pdf">trivially easy</a> to convert the kit’s incomplete part into a fully functional frame or receiver. Some kits can be turned into a working firearm after the buyer drills a single hole in the kit’s frame. Others require the user to sand off a small plastic rail.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Fifth Circuit backed these attempts to evade the law. It claimed that frames missing a single hole are “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/vanderstok-v-garland-2">not yet frames or receivers</a>.” The three Trump judges also argued that ghost gun kits may not “readily be converted” into a working gun because this phrase “cannot be read to include any objects that could, if manufacture is completed, become functional at some ill-defined point in the future” — even if only a negligible amount of work is required to make the gun function.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the question now is whether a majority of this Supreme Court, which often <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/23/23180205/supreme-court-new-york-rifle-pistol-clarence-thomas-second-amendment-guns">takes an expansive view of gun rights</a>, will sign onto this attempt to neutralize the background check and serial number laws.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The good news for supporters of gun regulations is that the Court has already signaled that it will not do so. The Court first heard this case, albeit in an expedited process, in August 2023, and it voted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/8/8/23824635/supreme-court-ghost-guns-garland-vanderstok-amy-coney-barrett-shadow-docket">temporarily leave</a> the background check and serial number requirements in full effect while the case made its way through the lower courts. The bad news is that the vote in that August 2023 decision was 5-4, with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining the Court’s three Democrats. So if just one justice flips, the <em>VanDerStok </em>plaintiffs could prevail.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">At what point does a gun become a gun?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>VanDerStok</em> turns on the question of when a partially manufactured gun becomes sufficiently gun-like that it should be regulated as if it were a fully operational firearm. Congress, by applying the relevant laws to operational guns, frames, receivers, and items that “may readily be converted” into an operational gun, clearly intended that a gun need not be fully complete to be regulated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, it’s also clear that there is a point when an incomplete gun is not yet subject to the background check and serial number laws. For example, if someone buys a bucket full of raw steel and wood that a skilled gunsmith, after many hours of work using the proper tools, could turn into a firearm, that bucket does not need to come with a background check.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Up until very recently, this question of “at what point does a gun become sufficiently complete to trigger certain federal laws?” would have been resolved by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/467/837/"><em>Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council</em></a> (1984), the Supreme Court held that, when an agency is given the power to issue regulations interpreting a federal law (and ATF has that power over the gun laws at issue in <em>VanDerStok</em>), courts should typically defer to how the agency decides to resolve any ambiguities in that law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, in a less imperious Supreme Court, <em>VanDerStok</em> would be an easy case. ATF <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-852/315742/20240625172334020_23-852%20VanDerStok.pdf">issued a regulation in 2022</a> that clarifies that the background check and serial number laws do apply to ghost guns. Under <em>Chevron</em>, that should be enough to resolve this case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last June, however, the six Republican justices <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">voted to overrule <em>Chevron</em></a>. Their decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-451_7m58.pdf"><em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em></a> (2024) establishes that henceforth, whoever controls a majority of the Supreme Court will have the final word on thousands of policy questions that, under <em>Chevron</em>, used to be resolved by federal agencies. So <em>VanDerStok</em> will give us an early window into how these justices intend to use their new, self-given policymaking authority.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If these justices concern themselves with the text of federal gun law, however, it’s still difficult to see how they could affirm the Fifth Circuit’s decision to exempt ghost guns from the background check and serial number requirements.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reason why is that federal gun law does not simply announce a vague standard — that incomplete guns that “may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive” are still subject to federal regulation. It also provides an example of a particular kind of not-yet-ready-to-fire gun that is subject to the background check and serial number laws. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The relevant federal law explicitly states that a “starter gun” — that is, a gun with a plugged barrel that is designed to fire blanks, and that is typically used to begin track or swim races — does count as a gun that is subject to federal regulation. So if someone buys a starter gun, they must submit to a background check, even though starter guns cannot be used to shoot anyone without significant alterations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In its brief, the Justice Department suggests that this reference to starter guns was inserted into the statute because of a “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-852/315742/20240625172334020_23-852%20VanDerStok.pdf">do-it-yourself gunsmith</a>” who “distributed firearms to gang members by buying starter pistols in bulk.” He would then disassemble these starter guns and “using an electric hand drill mounted in a drill press stand, bore[d] out the plugged barrel and enlarge[d] the cylinder chambers to accommodate .22-caliber cartridges.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s significantly more work than is required to assemble many ghost guns. The fact that Congress intended to regulate devices that need to be disassembled and “bored out” using reasonably specialized equipment before they could be used as weapons suggests that Congress also intended for an already-disassembled gun that is missing a single hole in its frame or receiver to be subject to regulation. A ghost gun is much closer to being a fully operational firearm than a starter gun.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, while <em>VanDerStok</em> should not be a difficult case, the fact that four justices previously voted to exempt ghost guns from background checks and serial numbers suggests that this Court will make this case more difficult than it needs to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In overruling <em>Chevron</em>, the Court declared that it should have far more control over US policy than it has had in recent decades. Now we’re going to get a taste of how this GOP-dominated Court intends to use that power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Miami has long had a reputation as a balmy party destination, a place where spring breakers, Lamborghini-driving showoffs, Cuban culture, and clubs coalesce.<br><br>But the South Florida city has undergone a major transformation over the past 15 years. It became an international hub for art with Art Basel. Its high-end food scene blossomed, becoming one of the best in the nation. And, somehow, it <a href="https://qz.com/texas-florida-sun-belt-wall-street-banks-migration-1851473745">quietly</a> <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/02/17/west-palm-beach-has-become-wall-street-south/">became</a> <a href="https://www.whitewolfcapital.com/news/is-wall-street-south-here-to-stay/">“Wall Street South.”<br><br></a>J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs both now have major footprints in the city, and several hedge funds have sprung up there as well. A slew of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/join-us-in-miami-love-masters-of-the-universe.html">Silicon Valley companies set up shop in Miami</a> after the pandemic, too, in search of lower taxes and fewer Covid restrictions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe it&#8217;s not so surprising, then, that Miami, newly flush with major corporations, has seen a bigger office comeback post-Covid than almost any other American city, <a href="https://www.placer.ai/blog/placer-ai-office-index-august-2024-recap">according to data from Placer.ai</a>, a startup that measures foot traffic to offices.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yesterday, <em>Today Explained</em> kicked off a miniseries on work after the pandemic by looking at how American workers were leaving the country <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-of-work/374273/portugal-remote-digital-nomad-work-life-balance">in search of work-life balance</a> and finding it in Portugal, where the country’s unique digital nomad visa programs have led to a flourishing expat remote-worker community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For today’s installment, the <em>Today, Explained</em> podcast team returned stateside, venturing to Miami to find out more about why companies there are calling knowledge workers into the office once again, and what it can show us about the delicate dance that employers all over the nation face as they try to rebuild their corporate cultures.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Going back to office for the “culture”&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four years after the pandemic, only about 35 percent of Americans with jobs that can be worked remotely still work entirely from home, according to a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/30/about-a-third-of-us-workers-who-can-work-from-home-do-so-all-the-time/">2023 report from Pew</a>. They tend to be knowledge workers – people whose jobs demand that they’re sitting at a computer the bulk of the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So why are Miami’s knowledge workers going into offices instead of staying home?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The very same industries that are pouring into the South Florida city — financial services and tech — are the ones telling workers that it’s time to invest in “culture.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think people are actually opting in to work in this culture,” Alex DiLeonardo, chief people officer for Citadel Securities, told us when we visited the financial firm’s sleek headquarters in the Brickell neighborhood of Miami in September.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DiLeonardo used a lot of HR speak, but what he described to us was a vibes-y idea among employers that collaboration and values are forged from human interaction. The best way they think they can foster that creative “culture”? To make workers come into the office. At Citadel Securities, that means in-office, five days a week. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea of a workplace “culture” almost <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/15/23307268/apple-hybrid-working-model-return-to-office-september">always</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-managing-directors-asked-work-office-five-days-week-memo-2023-04-12/">shows</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/09/disney-ceo-bob-iger-tells-employees-to-return-to-the-office-four-days-a-week.html">up</a> when a CEO calls people back to the office. Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy informed employees that they would be required to return to the office five days a week. <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/ceo-andy-jassy-latest-update-on-amazon-return-to-office-manager-team-ratio">In a statement</a> titled “Strengthening our culture and teams,” Jassy made this case for in-office work: “[C]ollaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more effective; teaching and learning from one another are more seamless; and, teams tend to be better connected to one another.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/IMG_2128.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.366492146597,100,39.267015706806" alt="A skyscraper with paned windows." title="A skyscraper with paned windows." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The Miami offices of Citadel Securities. | Victoria Chamberlin/Vox" data-portal-copyright="Victoria Chamberlin/Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s what Hasan Altaf was looking for when he recently graduated from college. “I think in the office, it&#8217;s just creativity, collaboration, everything,” he told us. <br><br>Altaf, 22, is now a software engineer at Citadel Securities in Miami. During the pandemic, he spent eight months working an internship fully remote and said the whole thing felt kind of empty. “I felt disconnected with my team. [T]hey were just, like, faces on a screen. I never met them in person.” Now, he’s got an easy commute by metro, there are killer views of the ocean and city from the building, and he gets to absorb lessons from his colleagues in real time. “The juices are flowing here.” <br><br>To be clear, not everyone is fully opting into office life: One expert we talked with told us only about 20 percent of the 100,000 workers he’s surveyed want to be in an office five days a week. Another 30 percent wanted to work from home 100 percent of the time. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While people are back in the office at greater rates in Miami, in general, workers across the country want more flexibility.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Companies vs. the worker</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many workers have gotten a taste of a different kind of life over the past four years, and for the vast majority, working from home has afforded an unprecedented sense of work-life balance, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/30/about-a-third-of-us-workers-who-can-work-from-home-do-so-all-the-time/">according to Pew</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of them resent giving up the flexibility of hybrid or fully at-home work in favor of ideating in an <a href="https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-truth-about-open-offices">open-concept office</a> in hard pants. A <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/majority-remote-workers-would-quit-if-forced-return-office-1952885#:~:text=In%20FlexJobs'%20recent%20report%2C%2057,to%20return%20to%20the%20office.">recent survey of remote workers</a> found that nearly 60 percent said they would quit if asked to return to the office.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And there’s evidence that flexible models might be good not just for workers but for companies,&nbsp; too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to a recent <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/business/hr-payroll/remote-work-statistics/#sources">USA Today Blueprint survey</a>, 58 percent of white-collar workers prefer a hybrid model (working from home at least three days a week).&nbsp;A <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/real-estate/our-insights/americans-are-embracing-flexible-work-and-they-want-more-of-it">McKinsey survey</a> this summer found that&nbsp;87 percent of workers would say yes to flexible work if it’s offered.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This means a company that adopts a fully in-office policy team could see the plan backfire, according to <a href="https://nbloom.people.stanford.edu/bio">Nick Bloom</a>, a professor of economics at Stanford University who studies workplace trends.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[O]ne way this plays out is they have a ton of quits. They find it harder to hire,” Bloom said. “I know from talking to my own undergrads and MBAs, they don&#8217;t want to go in five days a week. So it&#8217;s going to be harder to hire them,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of firms get hung up on the idea of productivity, Bloom said. Companies, he argues, should measure their office policies against profitability.<em> </em>Not paying for an office is a huge cost saver. “It also turns out, if you&#8217;re hiring folks remotely, you can hire a lot better employee for your money because you&#8217;re not looking locally, you&#8217;re looking nationally or even globally.” The talent pool is the entire world.<br><br>Bloom recently <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07500-2">published a study</a> looking closely at this question of productivity. Working with a giant Chinese travel company, Bloom and his team compared two cohorts: The first worked in the office five days a week and the second was offered a hybrid schedule. They found that the hybrid workers were happier with their jobs and that fewer quit. They also found that performance reviews were not affected. People got their work done and they were happier.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">“Give me a good reason to come in every day” </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chatting up workers in Miami, we heard some complaints: “Give me a good reason to come in every day.” “I don’t need my boss babysitting my work.” “Commuting sucks.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of people, though, were willing to meet the CEO culture warriors halfway and acknowledged that some time in the office was great for getting to know the people they worked with. They were also able to build trust with colleagues and learn by watching others do their jobs. For companies in the tech and financial spaces that are so vital to Miami’s rebirth, having workers meet them in the middle helps them navigate a number of issues beyond “culture,” too, including data privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Workers will be the ultimate judge of whether Citadel Securities and other companies with the strictest office policies are right for them. If they disagree, they might just choose to develop their careers elsewhere.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For DiLeonardo, these complicated choices are just part of the new world order of work — and maybe even a sign of how far work culture has come.<br><br>“As somebody who spent my entire career in the people space, I think it&#8217;s great that all of these different forms of working are causing organizations and societies to ask questions about how best to enable individuals to succeed in their different roles and their different careers,” he said.&nbsp; “But I also think that leaves a ton of room for organizations to choose the kind of environment that they provide and be very clear in the social contract about what it means to work at this&nbsp; company.”&nbsp;</p>

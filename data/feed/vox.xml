<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve always believed that the world is complicated and that our desire for simplicity is understandable but dangerous.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when does the impulse to embrace ambiguity become its own pathology? Sure, the world is complex, but sometimes we have to pass judgment. We have to be willing to say that something is true and something is false, that something is right and something is wrong.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how do we know when things really are that clear? And how do we avoid the impulse to lie to ourselves when we know they’re not?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ta-Nehisi Coates is an author, essayist, and one of our most celebrated living writers. He’s just published a new book called <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/653438/the-message-by-ta-nehisi-coates/"><em>The Message</em></a> that has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/media/cbs-ta-nehisi-coates-tony-dokoupil-interview/index.html">stirred up quite a bit of controversy</a> because the longest essay in it is about his trip to Palestine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you know almost nothing about the conflict between Israel and Palestine, the one thing you’d probably be comfortable saying is that it’s complicated. This is an assertion Coates challenges directly. For him, the moral arithmetic is simple and Israel&#8217;s treatment of the Palestinian population is fundamentally wrong.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I invited Coates on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to explore where he’s coming from and why he felt it was important to write this book. But the point wasn’t to have a debate or an argument. I invited Coates because I think he’s smart and sincere and doesn’t write anything without seriously thinking about it. This conversation is really about the role of the writer and the intellectual and what it means to describe the world with moral clarity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As always, there’s <em>much</em> more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset">Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What&#8217;s been the most surprising thing to you about the reaction to this book so far?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m surprised at the surprise. So, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/07/media/cbs-ta-nehisi-coates-tony-dokoupil-interview/index.html">the CBS interview</a> was the first live interview. I was not surprised by the aggression, tenacity, whatever you want to call it. Or, I should say, I knew that was going to happen eventually. I didn&#8217;t know it was going to happen there. So I was surprised in the sense that, “Oh, it&#8217;s right now.” And it took me a minute to catch up with it and realize that it’s actually happening right now, but this is what it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m surprised that people are like, “I can&#8217;t believe that happened.” I understand I am going to go into some arenas where you don&#8217;t usually say the state of Israel is practicing apartheid. That&#8217;s just not a thing that you usually hear people saying in places like that, and so I am going to say that. And what&#8217;s going to come out of that, I have no idea, but I hope people understand that this is what&#8217;s happening.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You made a deliberate choice to write about Palestine, which, as you know, is an impossibly charged issue. Why wade into these waters? Why this conflict? Why now?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s impossibly charged. This is so clear. It was so clear. And when I saw that — and maybe this is naive, maybe you&#8217;re right, maybe it is impossibly charged — but I was just like, &#8220;Oh, this is easy.&#8221; Not easy like easy to do, easy to write, but the math is clear. You know what I mean?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The word I used at the time when I saw it was Jim Crow, because it was so obviously Jim Crow. You tell me you got one set of roads for one group of people, another set of roads for another group of people, and the roads you have for the other group of people are impossibly longer. They take more to get from point A to point B. Those roads have checkpoints, and the checkpoints sometimes materialize out of nowhere. This is all fact.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever you think about it, maybe you think that&#8217;s the way it should be, but this is what it is. This is actually what it is. You&#8217;re telling me that one group of people has constant access to running water, and the other group of people don&#8217;t know when their water might be cut off?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You&#8217;re telling me that that other group of people, depending on where they live, if they&#8217;re in a particular area on the West Bank, it might be illegal for them even to collect rainwater? You&#8217;re telling me one group of people has access to a civil system of criminal justice, so that when they get arrested, they know their rights, they&#8217;re told why they&#8217;re arrested, lawyer, etc. You&#8217;re telling me the other group has no access to that? That they can be arrested, that no one needs to tell them why they&#8217;re being arrested? No one needs to tell their families that if they are killed, you don&#8217;t even have to return their bodies? What is that?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when you compare Palestine to the Jim Crow South, my reaction is that these are both moral obscenities, but they&#8217;re different. And I do think it&#8217;s complicated —</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tell me why you think it’s complicated.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think it matters that many Palestinians still support the attacks on October 7. I think it matters that Black people in the Jim Crow South wanted to be treated as equal citizens in a fully democratic America.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s generally true that Palestinians want equal rights in a fully democratic Israel. And if they had that they might vote to end its existence as a Jewish State. And you know what? If I was a Palestinian who was pulling my friends and my family out of the fucking rubble, I&#8217;d probably vote the same way. I understand that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Personally, I hate the idea of a state based entirely on religious or ethnic identity. But I&#8217;m not Jewish and I don&#8217;t live in Israel and I understand why the people who do live there would have these concerns. And I also think it matters that Jews are indigenous to that land and have nowhere else to go. I just think that complicates the picture in other ways.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I am of the mind that discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion is never acceptable. There is nothing in this world that will make separate and unequal okay, and there’s nothing — and I’ll use this word — that makes apartheid okay. That&#8217;s not complex for me. It&#8217;s like the death penalty is not really complex for me, because you cannot guarantee to me that the state will not execute an innocent person. You just can&#8217;t. So I&#8217;m against it, period. There aren&#8217;t any exceptions to that.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I haven&#8217;t been to Palestine but I know it&#8217;s bad and I know what you saw there is wrong. And I don&#8217;t believe there is any such thing as a moral occupation, because whatever the reasons for it, you cannot occupy a people without visiting cruelties upon them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But for me, the main question isn’t necessarily the badness of the situation, which is incontestable. It&#8217;s how the hell do we end this? And all these complications that I was mentioning earlier, that&#8217;s the stuff that has to be accounted for if there&#8217;s any hope of a way forward.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are sitting here asking ourselves why we don&#8217;t have a workable solution, while we exclude one of the two significant parties, and I guess my politics would say the most significant party, because that&#8217;s just where I come from in terms of the oppressed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How can you decide what is going to be the solution when every night when I watch reports from the region, I can name only one person who is of Palestinian heritage, who I regularly see articulate a solution or an idea? How do we get to a solution when our journals, our newspapers, our literature that dominate the conversation is not just devoid of Palestinian perspectives, but it&#8217;s devoid of Palestinians themselves?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are not having a conversation about solutions because we&#8217;ve basically prevented a whole group of people from entering into the frame. And so it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re putting the cart before the horse. We&#8217;re frustrated that we don&#8217;t have a solution, but we&#8217;re not actually talking to somebody.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I agree that our moral imagination needs to extend in both directions as far as possible. I understand writing this as a kind of corrective, feeling like there was a lack of empathy for the Palestinian experience because their story hasn&#8217;t been told enough, hasn&#8217;t been represented enough. I can understand that, I really can. And if I&#8217;m being honest, I think if I went there and saw the suffering firsthand, all of this would feel a whole lot less abstract to me and it would hit differently. And I don&#8217;t know how that would change how I think about it —</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when are you going to go, Sean?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a fair question, and the only honest answer is I don’t know.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You should go. I know it&#8217;s hard. And look, I&#8217;m putting you on the spot, but it was extremely hard. First of all, you are a journalist. That&#8217;s the first thing. That&#8217;s my first case for you going. The second case is this is being done in your name. And we&#8217;re going to pay for it. We&#8217;re going to pay for it one way or the other. We will pay for this. We will pay for this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">God, now I think it&#8217;s your responsibility to go. I&#8217;m sorry, but I really do believe that. I really do believe that because you are someone who is obviously curious, obviously wants to know things. And the reason why I&#8217;m pushing you is because that vague sense of injustice is exactly what I had. That is exactly how I felt, man.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I’ll push you a little on that because it runs in both directions. If I went to Israel and toured the villages that were plundered on October 7, I&#8217;d feel this same kind of indignation and rage.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You should, though. You should see that, too. I don’t think those feelings are contrary.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No, I don&#8217;t mean to say they&#8217;re contrary. I&#8217;m just saying I would still be left feeling the sense of hopelessness at the tragedy of it all.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think you would know more, though. I think you would know more. You sound like me. This is what I thought. Even on the eve of the trip, I was like, &#8220;Boy, this is going to be really complicated.&#8221; I thought the morality of it would be complicated. And there&#8217;s a reason why I began that chapter in [World Holocaust Remembrance Center] Yad Vashem, and it is because the fact of existential violence and industrial genocide brought to the Jewish people of this world is a very, very real thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it&#8217;s like, how do you confront that and reconcile that with Israel? Because you want that group of people to be okay. You feel like maybe that group of people is entitled to certain things. And I mean that in the best kind of way. They&#8217;re entitled to a kind of safety, given what happened to them. You feel deep, deep sympathy. And so before I went, I was like, &#8220;Wow, this is going to be morally dicey.&#8221; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think you should go. I&#8217;m not even saying you&#8217;re going to agree with me. I&#8217;m not saying you&#8217;re going to end up where I ended up, but I think you should go.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you think both sides of this conflict can tell a story about it that makes them right and the other side wrong? Because there are so many victims and perpetrators on both sides, because the cycle of violence and retaliation stretches back so far.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t think it stretches back that far. It&#8217;s 1948. It&#8217;s not even 100 years. I mean, I interviewed people that were very much alive in 1948, so I don&#8217;t even think it&#8217;s back that far. I think that when we say things like that, no disrespect, but I think we say things like that to make it harder than it actually is. It&#8217;s a lifetime that is not even over yet. And what I would say is my opposition to apartheid, to segregation, to oppression, does not emanate from a belief in the hypermorality of the oppressed or even the morality of the oppressed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The civil rights movement kind of fooled us with this because it was kind of a morality play and it was a very successful strategy. But whether Martin Luther King was nonviolent or not, segregation was wrong. Even when Malcolm X was yelling “by any means necessary,” segregation was still wrong. It was still wrong. So for me, it&#8217;s not even a matter of sides being right. The system that governs both sides is wrong.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I remember once hearing you talk about the vulgarities of punditry. Pundits are not in the truth-seeking business. Pundits make pronouncements. That&#8217;s the whole stupid, mindless game. But you&#8217;re not like that. You have never been like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One reason I retreated into podcasting is that I don&#8217;t feel that pressure to pronounce in that way, and even doing it in a serious way for me felt futile. But I don&#8217;t have your stature and I don&#8217;t have your reach, so it&#8217;s different for you, I imagine. Do you think you can make a real difference here? Or is that not even part of the calculus?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I needed to write what I saw. This is uncomfortable to say, but I think this moment matters. I was talking to a good friend yesterday, a colleague, a very intelligent and sharp young writer. And we were actually sitting around a table. It was a Muslim woman and another writer there, and we were all in sympathy in terms of our politics. And she&#8217;s making the point that this thing that&#8217;s happening right now, it actually matters, it&#8217;s making a difference. And I was saying, I want out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m doing this book tour and then I&#8217;m out of here, man. I&#8217;m going back to my French studies. I&#8217;m out. And I&#8217;m not out because I&#8217;m scared to say what I want to say. I&#8217;m not out because of the heat. I am out because it just feels unnatural. And part of it feels unnatural because I&#8217;m not Palestinian, but it also feels contrary to writing, which is always seeking, always trying to learn, always trying to figure it out, always asking questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when you&#8217;re making these pronouncements, as I admit I am now, you wonder, am I actually betraying the craft? Should I have just written a book, put it out, and be done with it? There&#8217;s always that voice in the back of your mind. But when I was over there, man, what they said to me over and over again was, “Tell them what you saw.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I come on this show every week and I praise the virtues of doubt and uncertainty and I believe in that. But refusing to describe things simply and clearly can become a kind of moral and intellectual crime. You&#8217;re right about that. And I still think sometimes things really are complicated and not so neat and maybe the challenge of being a writer and or just a human being is being honest and wise enough to know the difference. But it is hard sometimes, and I do think this situation is complicated, and it’s also true that sometimes withholding moral judgment can be its own kind of cowardice.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Ta-Nehisi Coates</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah. And again, I just want to take it back. When that day comes, when the Palestinians are back in the frame, when they’re invited to tell their own stories, when they’re invited to take their place at the table, I have no doubt that what will come out of that will be quite complicated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">South Africa&#8217;s complicated. They defeated apartheid, but did they change the basic economic arrangements? My understanding is not as much as a lot of people would&#8217;ve wished. Better than apartheid, but it&#8217;s not done. It is indeed quite complicated. The victory is indeed quite complicated, but the morality of apartheid is not.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is hard for me is I&#8217;ve been on a couple of shows now where I&#8217;ve had some debate about this with people, and they never challenge the fact of what&#8217;s going on. So when I say half the population is enshrined at the highest level of citizenship and everyone else is something less, they don&#8217;t say, “Ta-Nehisi, that&#8217;s not true.” But perhaps this is just where I sit. It&#8217;s like when your parents grew up in Jim Crow, when they were born in the Jim Crow, that is an immediate no-go. I feel like I don&#8217;t know what comes after this, but that is wrong. That&#8217;s wrong. You know what I mean? What is after that might be quite complicated and quite hard, but that is not the answer at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m sitting in a cave in the South Hebron Hills [in the West Bank] with a group of people, and they&#8217;re telling me about their fears of being evicted out of a cave, man. When I look at — &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s complicated&#8221; — when I know full well it&#8217;s not. What to do about it is probably complicated. But you begin from the basis that this is wrong and the very difficult work of figuring it out can proceed after that.</p>

						<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic Party is extraordinarily unified behind Vice President Kamala Harris — a cohesion born of a defeat-Donald-Trump-at-all-costs strategy in an election with deep consequences for the future of American democracy. But the truce is a fragile one that is likely to end with the presidential election, whether Harris wins or loses. If Harris is president, the progressive and centrist wings of the party will compete for control of her agenda. A Harris loss, meanwhile, would kick off a period of party-wide soul-searching and intense competition over the best ideological path forward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a new series, Vox explains the current state of the American left: its transformation during the four years of Joe Biden’s presidency, its coming internal debates and fractures, its power players and shifting constituencies, and its radically different trajectories, which hinge on what happens in November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The series will include new pieces daily from October 14 to October 18. And please check out our September series: <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/373288/the-right-explained">The present — and future — of the American right</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, there’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.un.org/en/academic-impact/we-are-indigenous-addressing-global-challenges-indigenous-knowledge">been</a>&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/tek/description.htm">growing</a>&nbsp;appreciation for&nbsp;<a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/14022024/to-save-the-planet-traditional-indigenous-knowledge-is-indispensable/">Indigenous</a>&nbsp;land stewardship and traditional knowledge. But what gets overlooked is that successfully managing those lands means that Indigenous people have already survived severe climate events and extreme weather.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, Indigenous communities are leading the way in climate adaptations — from living alongside rapidly melting ice to confronting rising seas and creating community support networks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indigenous knowledge does not mean going back to “traditional” methods; it means evolving, a characteristic that has always been a part of Indigenous life. There’s no easy fix for the planet. But Indigenous people have simple solutions rooted in the depth of their knowledge. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recently we launched Changing With Our Climate, a limited-run series exploring Indigenous solutions to extreme weather rooted in history — and the future. This summer and fall, we’ll be publishing five features that center an Indigenous community confronting extreme weather on the front lines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This series has not set out to mythologize Indigenous communities with bespoke, unapproachable, or mystic traditional practices and solutions — but instead underscores humility as a throughline. Indigenous people realize we cannot bend the world to our human will. We’re far better and more resilient when we tune in and lean into changes when possible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By showing the connections between storms, climate disasters, and issues of tribal sovereignty, Changing With Our Climate will explore what it really means when we say that climate change is an existential threat — and how we can work together to find a way out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of neuroscience research, the mouse reigns supreme: <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-many-mice-and-rats-are-used-us-labs-controversial-study-says-more-100-million">in the US alone, tens of millions of mice</a> are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">studied</a> as a proxy for the human brain in labs. They’re small, they breed quickly, and they’re relatively easy to genetically manipulate, making mice ubiquitous in biomedical science. When studying something fundamental to biology, like how individual cells work, the leap from mouse to human doesn’t feel egregious. But when mice are used to study distinctly human conditions like autism, the parallels start to break down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fifteen years ago, researchers <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/mouse-models-for-autism-debut/">introduced the first two mouse models of autism</a>, each carrying a genetic mutation linked to autism in humans. They claimed that these mice behaved like autistic humans, unusually preferring solitude over meeting new mice, and squeaking only around half as often as their non-autistic littermates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their results made major waves, inspiring researchers to experiment with other autism-related genes. Since the late 2000s, neuroscientists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9189007/">have bred over 20 types of mouse models</a> with motor problems, sensory sensitivities, and repetitive behaviors. These each capture some hallmark of human autism — provided you buy that a mouse burying marbles is the same as, for example, an autistic child insisting on eating the same food every day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a freshly minted PhD working at the National Institute of Mental Health in the late 2000s, Jill Silverman <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/why-studying-autism-in-mice-may-be-doomed-to-fail/">ran experiments</a> on mice missing part of their <a href="https://gene.sfari.org/database/human-gene/SHANK3">SHANK3<em> </em>gene</a>, a mutation found in about 1 in 100 autistic people. These SHANK3 mice seemed to show “autistic-like behaviors” like social discomfort and compulsive grooming, similar to the repetitive body movements, or <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/what-you-need-to-know-about-stimming-and-autism">stimming</a>, seen in some humans with autism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silverman, now a principal investigator at the <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/mind-institute/">UC Davis Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MIND) Institute</a>, still gets compliments on these mice — even though many of her original findings couldn’t be reproduced in future experiments. “They’ll say all this amazing stuff praising it,” she said. “And I’m like, that is the biggest mistake this field has ever made.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Billions of dollars have been poured into autism research over the last decade, funding a staggering number of experiments — including over 1,500 studies in the US <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED647174.pdf">in 2020 alone</a>. Many of these studies use animal models, especially mice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether or not you believe that animal testing <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/14/23794186/animal-testing-experiments-vivisection-academic-fraud-dishonesty-research">is ethical (many don’t)</a>, scientists in numerous research fields — especially neuroscience, genetics, and other areas of biology — <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">run experiments on animals</a>. To understand how cells in the brain communicate to form thoughts and guide behavior, you need a living brain connected to a living body. Millions of rodents are used — and nearly all killed — for science experiments every year, many of which are preclinical tests of new drugs and other treatments with potential public health benefits, including for autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, all attempts to make drugs that help people manage some of the more challenging effects of autism, like sensory sensitivity or self-harm, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10062405/">have failed</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked senior scientist <a href="https://www.sfari.org/people/brigitta-gundersen/">Brigitta Gundersen</a>, who manages Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (<a href="https://www.sfari.org/">SFARI</a>) funding for autism studies <a href="https://www.sfari.org/resource/autism-rat-consortium/">involving rodents</a>, for an example of a tangible quality of life improvement that this line of research has given us, she paused. “I struggle to think of examples across all of psychiatry, frankly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s this overall idea that understanding biology and understanding mechanisms will lead to better interventions,” she said. “But that hasn’t totally panned out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, figuring out how autism manifests in the brain and body should help scientists develop better treatments for some of its more debilitating symptoms, like seizures, mobility challenges, and self-harm. Given how much we still have to learn about how the brain works, autistic or otherwise, this kind of research is “a really long game,” Gundersen said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mouse models of autism-related gene mutations may help uncover the underlying biology of autism in the long run. But autistic people understandably want tangible support now, and research serving that need is hugely underfunded. “It barely matters to us what a mouse model says,” said Sam Crane, an advocate for people with disabilities and a public member of the federal <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/">Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee</a> (IACC), a group that helps policymakers decide what types of autism research to pay for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others, including the parents of autistic children with very high support needs, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/18/profound-autism-labels-neurodiversity/">fear that deprioritizing biological research will leave their loved ones behind</a>, turning attention away from developing potentially lifesaving treatments. Massive funding agencies like the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) are also wary of those trying to shift autism research away from genetics and neuroscience, arguing that <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102368">scientific breakthroughs often come from long-term studies of fundamental biology</a> — even when those studies don’t seem to offer real-world benefits in the short term.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking at the numbers, though, research exploring how to help autistic people navigate everyday life — the research many autistic people <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/what-we-believe/">say they’d like to see</a> — is still only getting about a quarter of the money allocated for autism research in the US. At a moment when <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/23/autism-epidemic-cdc-numbers/">autism diagnoses are on the rise</a> — for reasons scientists still don’t fully understand — why are we spending so much on mice that might help humans eventually, and so little on services that could help humans now?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The history of autism research, briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder.pdf">as defined by</a> the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), is usually characterized by communication challenges, trouble navigating social interactions, and a high sensitivity to change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also defined by how different the roughly 5.4 million people diagnosed with autism in the US are from each other. The wide umbrella of ASD includes people who live independently, have fulfilling careers and relationships, and can advocate for their own needs. It also includes people who don’t speak much (or at all), use a wheelchair, and may require full-time support from a caregiver for the entirety of their lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biologically speaking, autism — like the brain in general — is still poorly understood. In the 1950s and 1960s, medical professionals embraced the <a href="https://www.autism-help.org/points-refrigerator-mothers.htm">now-discredited “refrigerator mother” theory</a> linking autism to cold, distant parenting, <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/mothers-and-autism-evolution-discourse-blame/2015-04">blaming mothers</a> for their children’s condition. Later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/obituaries/28rimland.html">psychologist Bernie Rimland</a> presented evidence that autism is rooted in biology. Then, former physician Andrew Wakefield <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17057990/andrew-wakefield-vaccines-autism-study">published a paper</a> in 1998 incorrectly linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, fueling the modern <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22958419/covid-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-history">anti-vaccination movement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, most researchers believe that autism is strongly influenced by genetics. However, when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/signs-symptoms/index.html">symptoms can include everything</a> from difficulty reading social cues to seizures to constipation, it’s hard to figure out what genes might be causing what — after all, over several decades of work, scientists have compiled a <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/analysis-sequences-pegs-102-top-autism-genes/?fspec=1">list of 100 or so genes</a> that might be linked to autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To leaders at private funding agencies like SFARI, <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/?utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=IS-branded-conv&amp;utm_content=IS-evergreen&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwooq3BhB3EiwAYqYoEh4tmncVlXtGeW90hFwQGBeNbeY40R_1WxoBEujiGBrP1kGE4wm5ihoCKP4QAvD_BwE">Autism Speaks</a>, and the <a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/">Autism Science Foundation</a> (ASF), that complexity is precisely why we need basic research to explore the underlying biology and genetics of autism.<strong> </strong>The ultimate goal of these funders, several of whom have autistic children, is to find treatments for autism. Historically, some of these institutions <a href="https://the-art-of-autism.com/autism-speaks-revamps-its-mission-statement/">even wanted to find &#8220;cures.&#8221;</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But digging into the genetics of autism in the early aughts raised more questions than answers, forcing researchers to <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/dsm-5-redefines-autism/">reconsider what autism even is</a>. Meanwhile, in the absence of meaningful medical progress, some desperate parents turned to extreme DIY “cures” like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684109/autism-vaccines-treatment-cure-bleach">making their autistic kids drink bleach</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Despite the fact that they’re pointing in diametrically opposed directions, there’s a common theme with the refrigerator mother approach and the anti-vaccine approach,” said <a href="https://healthpolicy.fas.harvard.edu/people/ari-neeman">Ari Ne’eman</a>, assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-founder of the <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/">Autistic Self Advocacy Network</a> (ASAN). “Namely, they both really emphasize the idea of causation as central to the business of autism advocacy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Framing autism as a disease that “happens” to otherwise-healthy children as a consequence of their parenting, genetics, or environment makes it feel like something that science can fix, or even prevent in the first place. For many diseases — think deadly cancers — this wouldn’t be controversial.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But many autistic adults <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9233295/autism-rights-kanner-asperger">believe the “causation” framing is hugely misguided</a>. Efforts to pinpoint genetic markers of autism have <a href="https://proto.life/2023/04/prenatal-screening-for-autism-is-an-ethical-dilemma/">raised serious concerns</a> about eugenics — namely, that if parents could get a prenatal test for autism, many of them would choose not to have those children.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prenatal tests for many diseases, like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease, <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/common-tests-during-pregnancy">already exist</a>, and the fears of autism advocates are not unfounded. In Iceland, for example, nearly 100 percent of parents who get prenatal tests for Down syndrome — a chromosomal condition affecting as many as <a href="https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/facts-about-down-syndrome/">6 million people</a> worldwide,<strong> </strong>many of whom live long, healthy, fulfilling lives — <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/iceland-eliminated-syndrome-abortion/">choose to abort their pregnancy</a> if the results are positive, causing the population of Down syndrome children to almost completely disappear there. Even in the US, where <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/370668/how-trump-could-ban-abortion-medication-president">abortion is politically fraught</a>, over <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pd.2910/full%22">two-thirds of parents</a> choose not to give birth after finding out their child will have Down syndrome. Should it also be acceptable for parents to abort a pregnancy if they learn that their child will be autistic?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Autism research was really built with the assumption that the goal is a world without autism,” Ne’eman said. But a growing number of people embrace the neurodiversity movement, proposing that autism is simply <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NeuroTribes-Legacy-Autism-Future-Neurodiversity/dp/158333467X">another way to move through the world</a>. To them, the condition is not something to cure with medication or prevent with prenatal testing. This shift has led to significant controversy in the world of autism research. Autism Speaks <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/autism-speaks-but-should-everyone-listen">came under fire</a> in the mid-2010s for portraying autism as a devastating disease that ought to be stamped out, before <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/14/biggest-autism-advocacy-group-is-still-failing-too-many-autistic-people/">denouncing</a> that rhetoric in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, an effective prenatal test is not widely available — while autism does seem to be strongly influenced by genetics, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/the-problems-with-prenatal-testing-for-autism/">there isn’t a single gene that flags autism</a>. Prenatal tests and emerging <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24105096/crispr-gene-editing-theory-dna-diversity">gene-editing</a> tools like CRISPR seem to work best for conditions caused by a single genetic mutation, like <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sickle-cell-disease">sickle cell disease</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, scientists have listed about 100 genes that all seem related to someone’s likelihood of being diagnosed with autism, making a target for potential screenings, drugs, or other therapies much harder to pin down. Mutations in any one gene don’t necessarily mean that a person will be autistic, or shape what autism will look like for them. While some single-gene mutations cause specific neurodevelopmental disorders that fall under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder, like <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/understanding-fragile-x-syndrome/">fragile X syndrome</a>, they are <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/autism-genetics-explained/">relatively rare</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All considered, autism isn’t currently something that can be addressed by traditional drug development pipelines. Yet, funding for projects studying the biology of autism <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">more than quadrupled</a> since 2008, while funding for projects finding better ways to help autistic people in day-to-day life <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11464144/autism-funding-services-biology">fell or remained stagnant</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061219-3.html">Combating Autism Act</a>, which George W. Bush signed into law in 2006, Congress established the <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/">Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee</a>. As the name suggests, the Combating Autism Act was focused on finding treatments to prevent or “cure” autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, the vast majority of IACC members were not autistic — and their funding priorities were oriented accordingly. Their <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2009/strategic_plan_2009.pdf">first set of recommendations</a>, published in 2009, <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2009/02/comments-at-february-4-2009-iacc-meeting/">heavily skewed</a> toward funding the search for causes and cures of autism. For example, they proposed spending $75 million on developing animal models of autism — nearly 50 times more than they suggested spending on studying everyday support services for autistic people.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can biologists breed autistic mice? (Not really.)</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of biomedical research, where there are genetic risk factors, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK231336/">there are genetically altered mouse models</a>. But by continuing to fall back on the rodents that they are so accustomed to studying, researchers are holding themselves back from fully understanding how autism manifests in humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mice are small, reproduce quickly, and share about <a href="https://www.genome.gov/10001345/importance-of-mouse-genome">85 percent of their functional genes</a> with humans, making them desirable to geneticists hoping to study diseases outside of the human body. While non-animal models are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">slowly replacing animal testing</a> in many areas of science, “you need a live animal to study a disorder that’s solely behavioral,” Silverman said. “Cells don’t behave.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mice behave, but their behavior is very different from ours. So, neuroscientists have had to stretch <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/why-studying-autism-in-mice-may-be-doomed-to-fail/">to draw parallels</a> between the behavior of mice and autistic humans. If a mouse buries marbles with unusual fervor or over-grooms themselves, a study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108161/">may qualify it as</a> “repetitive behavior.” If a mouse prefers being alone to hanging out with a stranger mouse in its cage, it’s displaying “social deficits.” Studies have even measured changes in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763420304383">ultrasonic vocalizations in mice</a> to try to understand speech problems in autistic humans, and recorded electrical activity from the brains of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202402493">dogs with autism-related gene mutations</a> to see whether LSD could improve their social interactions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal behavior is finicky, though — especially when those animals are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23795087/animal-experiments-primates-mental-health-effective">living in tiny laboratory cages</a>, far from their natural habitat. The same mouse in the same marble-burying setup, for example, may bury fewer marbles than usual one day because it got distracted by the smell of whatever shampoo the experimenter used that morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Human error can play a role, too. An exhausted grad student may miscount the number of times two mice bump noses. Researchers in different labs may not even agree what that nose-bumping behavior means, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/how-artificial-intelligence-is-shaking-up-animal-behavior-studies-in-autism/">or how to classify</a> it in their papers. It “just lends itself to a lack of reproducibility,” Gundersen said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also makes preclinical trials for new treatments, which are often conducted in animals, challenging to translate to humans. Many symptoms, especially those related to social interactions and communication, are distinctly human — so much so that they’re nearly impossible to reproduce in mice. “You know,” Gundersen said, “no mice talk.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, more scientists are rejecting the idea that mice can actually exhibit autistic-like behaviors. “Nobody thinks that mice are people,” Gundersen told me. “Nobody thinks that mice are modeling autism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the number of publications featuring “mouse model(s) of autism” in the title <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTQa9l1rWjZRVtuBzBywJUiajxZ-aqDCcq834jrr3YpRgK92L5I3MR0taYvJhpOX0w9OWFgD9YTmErU/pubchart?oid=1977171245&amp;format=image">has steadily increased</a> since they were first introduced in the mid-2000s. A cynic might wonder why scientists are continuing to pursue this line of research, when both autistic self-advocates and a growing number of leaders in biomedicine are saying that it doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ne’eman said that some people in the autistic community jokingly refer to autism research as a “geneticist’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbernick/2020/08/25/the-rebuilding-and-the-autism-full-employment-act-of-2021/">Full Employment Act</a>” — a parallel to the proposed <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2021/10/04/americans-autism-employment-support-514667">Autism Full Employment Act</a>, which would create incentives for workplaces to hire autistic people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The grant application system is really competitive. To boost their chances of getting research funding, applicants increasingly have to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691616687745">twist their research proposals</a> to align with whoever will give them money. A lab interested in studying how gene expression guides brain cells to form connections with each other, for example, could pitch it as an autism study to open up additional funding opportunities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, Ne’eman suspects that some scientists are “looking at the autism research agenda as exclusively or primarily a vehicle for a relatively small number of abstract questions of basic science,” which aims to expand knowledge without necessarily translating to new drugs or other practical applications. Just look at the mice: it’s been clear for years that they’re a bad proxy for autistic people, but many biomedical researchers have built their careers around using them. Moving away from dysfunctional models requires time, money, and critically evaluating old, imperfect findings — something scientists aren’t really incentivized to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People like <a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/teams/dr-alycia-halladay/">Alycia Halladay</a>, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, worry that self-advocates like Ne’eman are too dismissive of basic science. But it isn’t that autistic people don’t value science. Rather, many of them think the somewhat futile search for a “cure” to autism shouldn’t receive as much funding as it does, relative to other areas of research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A more promising path for biomedical researchers could be studying rare neurodevelopmental disorders, like <a href="https://www.angelman.org/">Angelman syndrome</a> and <a href="https://www.rettsyndrome.org/about-rett-syndrome/what-is-rett-syndrome/">Rett syndrome</a>, caused by mutations in a single gene that exists in both mice and humans. People with disorders like these often have symptoms experienced by others with autism, like <a href="https://autism.org/autism-and-seizures/">seizures</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/expert-answers/autism-and-digestive-symptoms/faq-20322778">gastrointestinal issues</a>, and <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/sleep-problems-autism-explained/">insomnia</a> — which are more easily quantifiable in mice than, say, language.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silverman moved her lab in this direction entirely, after <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gbb.12803">losing faith in models</a> of other “autism-like behaviors.” She hopes that a clearer understanding of these specific genetic mutations will lay the foundation for things like better epilepsy medications down the line — not only for those with Angelman syndrome, but for anyone who experiences seizures alongside autism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I asked Halladay what research she wanted to see, as the <a href="https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/meet-alycia-halladay/">mother of an autistic daughter</a>. She agreed that more investigations of conditions related to autism, like sensory sensitivity, would be incredibly helpful to families like her own. Halladay, like many other parents, doesn’t want her daughter’s autism to go away; she just <a href="https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/meet-alycia-halladay/">wants more support</a> — and possibly medicine — to help her child live the best life possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Autism research is torn between different visions</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In general, Ne’eman thinks that “the average autistic person, as well as the average family member, doesn’t wake up in the morning thinking, ‘Have they found a better mouse model?’” They do think about whether they’ll be able to find a full-time caretaker who is covered by insurance, or what the newest adaptive communication devices will be capable of.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When autistic self-advocates were largely excluded from the decision-making process, funding for things that would help them immediately, like communication assistance or housing support, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8035332/">fell by the wayside</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s since changed — today, the IACC includes 23 non-autistic government employees and 22 public members, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/federal-autism-committee-names-new-members/">seven of whom are autistic</a> themselves. Their budget priorities <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">have shifted accordingly</a>, centering research questions like “What services and supports are needed to maximize health and well-being?” in addition to basic biology studies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, the gap between the committee’s proposed budget and how much funders actually spend <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/portfolio-analysis/2020/portfolio_analysis_2020.pdf?ver=5">has also grown</a>. And while funding for services and support doubled between 2019 and 2020, it still only accounted for 8.4 percent of the money spent that year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One big thing standing in the way of the IACC’s recommendations and reality: the biggest sources of science funding, public and private, weren’t really built to fund things other than biology research. Of the 28 organizations listed as funding autism-related projects between 2019 and 2020, the National Institutes of Health and SFARI — which only award grants for basic science and clinical research — <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/portfolio-analysis/2020/portfolio_analysis_2020.pdf?ver=5">together paid for over 80 percent of research</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Agencies like the <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncser/research/">Department of Education</a> and the <a href="https://acl.gov/">Administration for Community Living</a> pay for projects studying interventions like how to help autistic adults avoid institutionalization and live as independently as possible — <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/what-we-believe/">major priorities for autistic self-advocates</a>. However, they only fund a tiny portion of autism research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Solving this problem will likely require a major redistribution of funding, or a big overall increase in the pool of money available to everyone. “I’m not sure that you can totally fix it by just yelling at the NIH,” Crane said. In fact, she suspects that the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/od/office-of-national-autism-coordination-onac">Office of National Autism Coordination</a>,<strong> </strong>housed within the NIH, knows that they’re supposed to be funding more studies about how to support autistic people — they’re just not receiving grant applications for them. The NIH did not respond to Vox’s requests for comment by the time of publication.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One solution the IACC recommended involves <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">growing the overall pool of money</a> set aside for autism research to $685 million by next year. They specifically highlighted three research areas that need the most additional resources: lifespan issues, evidence-based interventions and services, and the development of culturally responsive services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By “lifespan issues,” the IACC means anything related to big life transitions: access to higher education and employment, opportunities to live as independently as possible alongside non-autistic community members, and health care. Figuring out how to help autistic adults — including those with the most severe disabilities — <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2012/08/career-options/">find fulfilling jobs</a> that they’re good at, <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2024/05/beyond-coercion-and-institutionalization/">stay out</a> of harmful psychiatric institutions, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/11/1098150733/dating-coaches-who-specialize-in-working-with-people-with-autism-are-in-demand">form healthy relationships</a> doesn’t require mouse models. It requires piloting initiatives like new <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/resources/housing/websites/">housing programs</a>, building better <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2017/10/everybody-communicates-our-new-toolkit-on-communication-supports/">assistive communication devices</a>, and other community-oriented research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Studying existing interventions to make sure they’re helping autistic people — not just making them appear non-autistic in public — is also crucial, Crane said. For example, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sweetpoochers/video/7405244574127361311?lang=en">applied behavioral analysis (ABA) therapy</a>, which rewards “goal behaviors” like making eye contact or saying hello to people, is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joannareese7/video/7356684281642634539?lang=en">controversial in the autistic community</a> because it can be experienced as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@burritos_and_adhd/video/7039802682588040453?lang=en">abusive and coercive</a>. Most existing studies on the effectiveness of ABA measured things like whether recipients <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/when-disability-defined-behavior-outcome-measures-should-not-promote-passing/2021-07">behaved better in the classroom</a>, rather than long-term outcomes like overall academic achievement or quality of life. With more money, Crane hopes this can change. “We need to be funding research that actually tracks the outcomes that matter to people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line is that we don’t need more mouse models of autism or of autism-like behaviors. Biomedical science has a role to play, especially in helping people manage symptoms of other autism-related health issues like epilepsy and sleep disorders — but it has claimed a disproportionately large chunk of autism research funding for too long.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people, especially the parents of children with intellectual and physical disabilities related to autism, argue that autistic self-advocates who push back against the biomedical research agenda are acting out of self-interest, leaving those with the most severe disabilities behind. People with different experiences of autism, Autism Science Foundation president Alison Singer <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/its-time-to-embrace-profound-autism/">argues</a>, need different things. Specifically, she believes that people with the most severe disabilities need the kinds of pharmaceutical interventions that biomedical research aims to find — and that many autistic self-advocates want to deprioritize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ne’eman believes the opposite is true. “Those with the most severe impairments are especially poorly served by research that does not relate back to their needs,” he said. In its <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/genetic-statement-concerns.pdf">statement on genetic research</a>, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network emphasizes, “Autistic people with the highest support needs are some of the most vulnerable members of our community. They deserve good lives with the right to make their own decisions, not yet another round of ‘cures’ that will not work.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neuroscience still has a lot to offer the autism community, but neuroscientists need to listen to the people they’re claiming to serve. Ditching outdated behavioral tests on mouse models of “autism-like behavior” might be a great place to start.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hi, I’m Paige Vega, Vox’s climate editor. Over the past few months, I’ve been working with Joseph Lee, a New York City-based journalist and member of the Aquinnah Wampanoag Tribe, on a series exploring Indigenous solutions that address extreme weather and climate change. And today, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we’ve published the project’s latest feature, a story that takes us to Idaho, where the Coeur d’Alene Tribe is undergoing a sweeping, multi-decade effort to restore an important wetland on the reservation. Their restoration, guided by the return of ancestral food sources, could serve as a model for the rest of the country. <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/377249/climate-solutions-traditional-indigenous-foods-water-potato">You can read it here</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stories like the Coeur d’Alene’s highlight the value of Indigenous solutions as we face increasingly extreme weather and natural disasters and navigate the brutal effects of the climate crisis.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around the world, Indigenous people have the smallest carbon footprint, <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/climate-change.html">according to the United Nations</a>, but are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change because they disproportionately live in geographically high-risk areas. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, these communities are also key sources of knowledge and understanding on climate change impacts, responses, and adaptation. Their traditional knowledge — focused on sustainability and resilience, from forecasting weather patterns to improving agricultural practices and management of natural resources — has increasingly gained recognition at the international level as a vital way to tackle climate change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I talked with Lee about the process of exploring several tribes’ climate dilemmas, and why the alternative posture they’re taking can offer us uniquely humble, approachable, and nature-first holistic approaches — something we could all take to heart. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paige Vega:</strong> <strong>Let’s talk about the project </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372001/changing-with-our-climate"><strong>Changing With Our Climate</strong></a><strong> and how it came to be. What were some of the goals you had — things you really wanted to hit home through these stories?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Joseph Lee: </strong>We wanted to look at different ways Indigenous people are adapting to climate change and extreme weather. For years, I’ve been hearing a lot about how Indigenous people <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/07/on-the-frontlines-of-climate-change/#:~:text=Indigenous%20communities%20are%20key%20sources,who%20oppose%20new%20energy%20projects.">are on the front lines of climate change</a> and that Indigenous knowledge and land stewardship are good for the environment, so we wanted to explore in depth what that actually looks like in different Indigenous communities. In each story, we really wanted to focus on a specific community, to show the diversity of Indian Country, the challenges tribes are facing, but also the range of creative solutions they’re working on. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How do you draw on your own perspective and life experiences as well as your professional experiences reporting on Indigenous communities?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Writing this series gave me a lot of opportunities to think about my own tribe, the <a href="https://wampanoagtribe-nsn.gov/">Aquinnah Wampanoag</a>. For example, in writing about the Coeur d’Alene Tribe’s water potato harvest, in our story that <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/377249">published on Vox today</a>, I was reminded of my tribe’s annual cranberry harvest, which I just attended. Or <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372014/shinnecock-nation-tribe-sea-rise-hamptons">when I visited the Shinnecock Nation in August</a>, I couldn’t help but see the similarities between their tension with their wealthy Hamptons neighbors and my tribe’s experience on Martha’s Vineyard. I think my personal experience can help me think about what questions to ask, but my background doesn’t give me any sort of secret code to understanding other tribes. Every tribe is different, and my goal for this series was to show the specific situations facing each featured community. </p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What is the value of traditional ecological knowledge and Indigenous solutions? What can all communities learn from the distinct way that tribes grapple with extreme weather and climate change?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge is based on generations of experience with land and environment. The Coeur d’Alene Tribe, for example, relied on a beloved elder’s memory when they began reconnecting old stream channels in their wetlands restoration project. And in our first piece [about <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358597/climate-extreme-heat-alaska-indigenous-solutions">how an Alaskan tribe dependent on sea ice is adapting to rapid warming</a>], Roberta Tuurraq Glenn-Borade, an Iñupiaq researcher, told me how she is gathering local observations about the climate in the Alaskan Arctic to help leave a detailed record for the future. That’s what Indigenous knowledge is, she said — an understanding developed over years and years. All of these stories show how it’s about constant evolution and looking forward. Indigenous knowledge has never been set in stone, and in the face of climate change, Indigenous people are adapting more than ever. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What were some of the highlights or unexpected insights that blew you away?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that struck me is that Indigenous people have been saying and doing these things for years, so the question becomes what’s been stopping them [now]. Sometimes colonialism can seem abstract, but there are so many clear examples, whether that’s systemic racism in the Hamptons against the Shinnecock Nation or the legacy of allotment policies on the Coeur d’Alene reservation. Government policies have made it that much harder for tribes to adapt to climate change. Threats to tribal sovereignty can also be seen as threats to climate adaptation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, despite the legacy of colonialism, some of these solutions are really straightforward ideas, like bringing <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/366765/megafires-climate-indigenous-controlled-burns">good fire [also known as controlled burns] back to the land</a> after decades of fire suppression policies. There’s a lesson here that we don’t have to overcomplicate these ideas, we just have to not just listen to people who have been doing the work for generations, but support them or get out of their way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s one lesson or takeaway that you’d like to leave readers with?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two things that I kept hearing while reporting these stories. The first is that we can’t control nature, that trying to impose our will on the environment has never worked. For the Shinnecock Nation on Long Island, for example, they understand that no matter what they do, they can’t stop the water from rising. So they are working with that knowledge to find a solution that will work for their community.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second is that we need to be thinking more long-term. The real change is going to take generations. A number of the Indigenous people I spoke to for this series talked about how they don’t expect to see the results of their work in their lifetimes, but they believe in it anyway. People in the Coeur d’Alene Tribe talked about how the previous generation of tribal leaders fought for legal justice but never saw the fruits of their labor, and now this generation understands they may not be around to see the salmon fully return, or their wetland restoration completed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;I think that kind of commitment to an effort that you may never see completed is something we could all learn from.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story is the fourth feature in a Vox special project,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372001/changing-with-our-climate">Changing With Our Climate</a><em>, a limited-run series exploring Indigenous solutions to extreme weather rooted in history — and the future.</em></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Last October, Aiyana James attended her first water potato harvest on the reservation of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe in northwestern Idaho. The weather was unusually cold, but she was determined to harvest her first water potatoes, a small wetland tuber that’s one of the tribe’s key traditional foods. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The smell of smoke and drying elk meat filled the air along the shore of Lake Coeur d’Alene, where the tribe set up food booths and educational stations. She waded into the frigid water barefoot to dig for the small tubers, while back on land, tribal members cooked them in a traditional pit bake, where elk, camas (a flowering plant with edible bulbs), and other locally harvested foods are layered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">James, who grew up in Portland, Oregon, and spent summers and school breaks on the reservation, was excited to take part in the harvest for the first time after moving to the reservation after college. But something was wrong: Early-season snow dampened the harvest, and although it was only a light dusting, tribal leaders spoke during the opening prayers about how unusual the conditions were. It had been a dry summer, and the water potato harvest was bad, something that has been happening more and more in recent years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I know that this isn’t supposed to be how it is,” James said. “Deep down within me, I&#8217;m like, ‘This just doesn’t feel right.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After their land in northwest Idaho was carved up by 1909 <a href="https://www.cdatribe-nsn.gov/#:~:text=Allotment%20Act,-1909&amp;text=For%20a%20time%20the%20Coeur,find%20new%20ways%20to%20prosper">federal allotment policies</a>, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-03/documents/cour_dalene_final_wetland_program_plan_december_2017.pdf">Western agriculture, and logging</a> thatback persists on some level today, the Coeur d’Alene Tribe lost a massive amount of acreage and, with it, their ability to manage the land and maintain balance between environmental protection and economic development. Salmon and trout disappeared from the streams. Fires became more frequent and powerful. Water potatoes and other key plants like camas, once staple foods for tribal members, started to disappear. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, extreme drought is making the situation even worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this is part of a reinforcing cycle of land degradation and climate change that the Coeur d’Alene Tribe has been fighting for decades. It’s a fight that James has now joined as one of the tribe’s first climate resilience coordinators.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To protect their land and community, the Coeur d’Alene are in the middle of an ongoing, multi-decade effort that relies, in part, on elder knowledge to restore an important wetland.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tribe is bringing back beavers and salmon, restoring native grasses, and repairing stream channels. Collectively, those efforts are designed to restore balance to the landscape, make it more resilient to future climate change by fostering interconnected ecosystems, and, tribal members hope, one day allow them to rely again on important ancestral foods like the water potato.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’ve been living off of the foods that are on our land for thousands upon thousands of years,” James said. “Reconnecting with that food reconnects us with our land.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Bring back the water potato, help the climate</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the country, ecological restoration is increasingly seen as a key part of the fight against climate change, and wetlands provide an especially important service in an era of global warming: They absorb carbon from the atmosphere. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the Coeur d’Alene tribe, a healthy wetland signifies a way to curb rising temperatures that will provide the basis for the return of a rich food source and a traditional way of life. That a wetland serves as the lynchpin means that the tribe is taking on the restoration of an ecosystem that is especially threatened as the world’s climate trends hotter and more arid. Because wetlands are areas where water is at or near the surface for large parts of the year, severe bouts of drought made more common by climate change threaten their existence.<br><br>According to the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2024-03/continued-decline-wetlands-documented-new-us-fish-and-wildlife-service-report">US Fish and Wildlife Service,</a> more than half of the wetlands in the lower 48 states are gone, and the rate of loss is only accelerating. Between 2009 and 2019, an area of vegetated wetlands in the US the combined size of Rhode Island disappeared. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s an overarching effort underway to help these imperiled landscapes. The 2022 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act <a href="https://www.doi.gov/priorities/investing-americas-infrastructure/ecosystem-restoration">included $1.4 billion</a> for ecosystem restoration and resilience, while President Joe Biden also <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/5/7/22423139/biden-30-by-30-conservation-initiative-historic">signed</a> an executive order setting a national goal to conserve at least 30 percent of the country’s lands and waters by 2030. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Coeur d’Alene aren’t alone in their focus on restoration, but they’re especially good at it. And their uniquely patient, humble approach could serve as a model for other communities working to restore the environment and prepare for climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tribal knowledge and expertise is especially important for restoration because Indigenous people are the ones who know what the land was like before it was degraded and what techniques will help restore it. The thread that ties it all together is traditional food, like the water potato. These cultural foods build connections between people and land and act as an especially tangible measuring stick of the impact that those connections can have on the environment. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">James says that camas, for example, grows better when it is regularly harvested.<strong> </strong>But because so much Coeur d’Alene land is now owned by non-Indigenous people, tribal members often don’t have access to camas fields, and some that have been unattended for years are now suffering.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We need these foods, but they also need us to flourish and to grow and get better,” she said. “If we do these things right and we focus on restoring our relationship and restoring our connection with our culture, sovereignty, and traditions, then that’s going to have lasting effects.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>An environmental restoration — and a cultural one, too</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the Coeur d’Alene reservation, soil health and biodiversity have declined, the water temperature is rising, and extreme weather like heat waves and drought are increasingly frequent. But the tribe’s restoration work is beginning to pay off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the summer of 2022, an <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/jul/13/an-adult-chinook-is-swimming-in-hangman-creek-for-/?utm_campaign=Rockies%20Today&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#:~:text=Pacific%20NW-,An%20adult%20chinook%20is%20swimming%20in%20Hangman%20Creek%20for%20the,2022%20at%2011%3A25%20a.m">adult salmon swam in Hangman Creek</a> for the first time in around 100 years. Two years after the tribe released juvenile salmon into the creek, and after an arduous journey out to the Pacific Ocean and back, the tribe welcomed salmon back to the creek for the first time in generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Ralph Allan Jr., the tribe’s fish and wildlife program manager, it was the culmination of 20 years of work that began with long days of fieldwork like planting trees. Now, he’s leading the department as it prepares to bring salmon back to the reservation. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Allan is also working to plant the seeds for a new generation of restoration advocates. He has led an internship program to get college students out in the field and three tribal members are currently enrolled in fish and wildlife degree programs. At the water potato harvest, Allan makes sure that department staff are working with the youth, showing them how to harvest the potatoes and pulling the kids out of the mud when they get stuck. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This cultural and community work is part of the tribe’s restoration effort. Allan worries that the tribe’s younger generation is not as connected to the land as he was growing up. “We&#8217;re not just reintroducing the species of salmon back to our people,” he said. “We&#8217;ve lost that cultural connection to the salmon as well, so we&#8217;re reintroducing a whole culture of salmon.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/AP958799959283.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107" alt="North Idaho College students Destiny Calvin, left, a Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe member, and Taylor Abrahamsson, a Coeur d’Alene Tribe member, react after digging water potatoes from the mud at Heyburn State Park near Plummer, Idaho." title="North Idaho College students Destiny Calvin, left, a Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe member, and Taylor Abrahamsson, a Coeur d’Alene Tribe member, react after digging water potatoes from the mud at Heyburn State Park near Plummer, Idaho." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="North Idaho College students Destiny Calvin, left, a Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe member, and Taylor Abrahamsson, a Coeur d’Alene Tribe member, react after digging water potatoes from the mud at Heyburn State Park near Plummer, Idaho. | Shawn Gust/Associated Press" data-portal-copyright="Shawn Gust/Associated Press" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">While salmon are a priority, they are just one piece of a complicated, interconnected ecosystem the tribe is working to restore. Take <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/23333298/beaver-dams-ecosystem-climate-change-cooling">beaver dams</a>. Dams raise the water table, extend the area along the banks of a river or lake that more animals and plants can inhabit, and keep more water on the landscape. All of this makes the area more welcoming to salmon and other wildlife, but also makes the landscape more resilient to drought and extreme heat because wetlands absorb and retain water that is released during drier periods, explains Tyler Opp, the tribe’s wetlands coordinator. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vox wp-block-embed-vox"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Why beavers matter as the planet heats up" src="https://volume.vox-cdn.com/embed/1ea6aec5a?autoplay=false&#038;loop=true&#038;placement=article&#038;player_type=youtube&#038;tracking=article:middle" allowfullscreen allow="encrypted-media;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The beaver dams also support clean, cold-water habitats for salmon, but to do that, they need trees. Since 2019, the tribe’s environmental programs department has planted over 18,000 trees from about a dozen different species, and plans to plant another 4,000 by 2025. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tribe has used beaver dam analogs — man-made approximations — to encourage beavers to return and posts to reinforce existing beaver dams. Gerald Green, a wildlife biologist for the tribe, says they are currently supporting about seven beaver dams in the creek. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trees, beavers, salmon, water — they’re all part of a cyclical, interdependent system the tribe is trying to restore and support. Cajetan Matheson, natural resource director and a tribal council member, says that addressing climate impacts or restoration goals one by one will not work. “Everything is really related to each other,” Matheson said. “You can&#8217;t just clear-cut a mountain and say, ‘Oh, now we&#8217;ve defeated the fire problem.’ There&#8217;s way more to it than that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These projects take time. Tyler Opp says that even though the scale of the work that needs to be done can be overwhelming, the tribe’s approach helps keep things in perspective. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By keeping longer-term goals in mind, like bringing salmon back, which could take decades, the tribe avoids Band-Aid solutions. The whole tribal government buys into this approach, year after year and generation to generation, and although the tribe is limited by funding and capacity, like many public agencies, this commitment allows them to focus on projects that will contribute to achieving that long-term vision. Despite the constraints, the tribe can unify behind a shared vision of the future, based on their collective history, knowledge, and appreciation for the land. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The tribe is able to prioritize things on a far longer time scale than state and federal agencies,” he said. “The tribe doesn&#8217;t have to think in terms of the next budget cycle for getting work done. All of [the things we are doing] are done for future generations.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Almost everyone I talked to in the Natural Resources Department credits that perspective to Felix Aripa, a tribal elder who <a href="https://ictnews.org/archive/coeur-dalene-historian-world-war-ii-vet-walks-on">died in 2016</a>. He is seen as instrumental in setting the tone for the tribe’s restoration work. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even Aiyana James, who never had the chance to meet him, says she’s listened to old tapes of Aripa. He was an early proponent of using beavers as a restoration partner and helped with things as straightforward as pointing out where a stream used to flow so that the technicians could use that as a guideline to restore the course rather than starting from scratch or guesswork. “The ultimate goal for anybody that works here in the Fish and Wildlife Program is to leave a legacy the way that Felix Aripa left his legacy and his mark on the program,” Allan said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before he passed away, Aripa helped Matheson and others put the tribe’s traditional seasonal calendar on paper. The calendar, which is based on seasonal indicators like tree sap rather than months and days, includes detailed information about foods, ecosystems, plants, animals, and human activities. “As we&#8217;re thinking broadly about how we approach restoration, it&#8217;s the framework that we can use,” Laura Laumatia, the tribe’s environmental programs manager, said. “It represents millennia of knowledge.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So while the tribe is proud of their progress, they are still working for the future. “I think it&#8217;s nice to work for 20 years in the same place because you do see some changes happening,” Laumatia said. “But we know that the fruits of our labor are really going to be 70 years from now.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Social Security reform” is one of those soundbites you might hear every election cycle without anything ever changing. Politicians have been sounding the alarm for decades, saying that the program — which helps retirees, people with disabilities, and their families stay afloat — is quickly running out of money. So what’s actually at stake?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Social Security is a pay-as-you go system, so taxes collected from today’s workers are spent on current beneficiaries. But because the workforce hasn’t grown as fast as the number of baby boomers entering retirement, there’s more being taken out of Social Security than being put in. The federal government relies on <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/understanding-the-social-security-trust-funds">trust funds</a> to fill the gaps, but those reserves are projected to be entirely depleted by 2035, according to the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL33028">Congressional Research Service</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t mean that the government won’t have any money left. But if Congress doesn’t do anything before those reserves are gone, the government will only be able to honor 83 percent of the scheduled benefits, which means that most, if not all, recipients of Social Security will see their household incomes fall. (By 2098, the government would only be able to cover <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL33028">73 percent</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That outcome would be disastrous for many. Since it was established in 1935, Social Security has been a hugely successful welfare program, and each year, it helps <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374488/ending-poverty-america-policy-choice">more than 20 million people</a> stay above the poverty line. It has never before been unable to pay out scheduled benefits. But if Congress doesn’t act, the number of Social Security beneficiaries who live below the poverty line <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/if-social-security-runs-out-money-poverty-among-older-adults-and-people-disabilities">could increase by more than 50 percent</a> by 2045, disproportionately impacting Black and Hispanic families.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is inevitable, and lawmakers will eventually have to do something to address the shortfall. The question is what.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Democrats and Republicans have proposed</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congress has no choice but to raise revenue, make cuts to the program, or some combination of the two. Democrats have called for raising taxes and, in some cases, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-warren-sanders-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-expand-social-security-by-2400-a-year-and-extend-solvency-for-75-years">expanding benefits</a>, while Republicans have mostly <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/06/social-security-line-half-billion-dollar-cut-house-gop-funding-bill/397722/">advocated for cuts</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, however, the GOP has promised that it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKeYcFk3bTQ">won’t cut people’s benefits</a>. Over the years, Donald Trump, for example, has advised <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-warns-us-house-republicans-not-touch-social-security-medicare-2023-01-20/">his fellow Republicans</a> that trying to gut Social Security is bad politics (though he’s also called the program’s disability insurance <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/clinton-disabilities-speech/500954/">“a racket”</a>). &nbsp;On the campaign trail this time around, <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/politics/trump-on-social-security-and-medicare">he’s promised</a> to neither “cut one penny from Social Security” nor raise the retirement age, as many Republicans have proposed doing in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump’s promises don’t add up to an actual plan. He <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/politics/trump-on-social-security-and-medicare">proposed reducing spending</a> on Social Security in each of his annual budgets while in office. And despite his promises, he has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/politics/trump-entitlements-social-security-medicare/index.html">suggested that he’s open</a> to Social Security cuts this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also recently proposed cutting taxes on Social Security payments. That might sound good because people will net more money when they receive their benefits. But the reality is more complicated. The <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/politics/trump-on-social-security-and-medicare">poorest households wouldn’t see any change</a> under that plan because Social Security benefits for those making below $32,000 are already untaxed, while the richest recipients would be more likely to see a tax cut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For her part, Vice President Kamala Harris has, like other Democrats, promised to preserve Social Security benefits, <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/">vowing to shore up the program</a> and make sure it stays solvent. She promises to do so by <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/">making</a> “millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Harris’s plan is light on the details, and isn’t exactly clear how the federal government will be able to raise enough revenue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What might Social Security reform actually look like?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no way around it: Lawmakers have to raise taxes on many families, including those who aren’t millionaires. Right now, any income that someone <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/maxtax.html">makes above $168,000</a> is not taxed for Social Security. That means that higher earners pay a smaller share of their income toward funding Social Security than lower- and middle-income earners.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are shocked to learn that rich people don&#8217;t pay taxes above” the cap, said Monique Morrissey, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To address this, President Biden has tried to reintroduce the Social Security tax on <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/3/6/biden-social-security">income above $400,000</a>. That weird formula simply boiled down to politics: Biden pledged to not raise taxes on any household making less than $400,000. But it creates what some experts call a doughnut hole — a pile of untaxable income between the cap and $400,000, and on its own, that’s <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/3/6/biden-social-security">not enough to fill</a> the anticipated budget shortfall. But if Democrats are serious about raising revenue for Social Security, they should start considering raising taxes on everybody. It might not be as unpopular as they fear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Democrats really need to lose that pledge” of not raising taxes on anyone making less than $400,000, Morrissey said. “People are happy to pay more in taxes when it’s something that they see is concretely benefiting them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, polls show that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/546890/americans-upbeat-future-social-security-benefits.aspx">the majority of Americans</a> support raising taxes to ensure they receive Social Security benefits, and only 31 percent would opt for making cuts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A modest payroll tax increase for Social Security would have little impact on most households and would greatly benefit the program. Moreover, Congress ought to consider expanding the categories of income that get taxed for Social Security, <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/if-social-security-runs-out-money-poverty-among-older-adults-and-people-disabilities">including investment income</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Raising taxes, however, is not an easy task, especially when those taxes are targeted at the wealthy. And if Congress fails to raise enough revenue, then it has to start looking at cuts to benefits. “It’s perfectly reasonable to think about solving a problem with some mix of revenue increases as well as benefit reductions,” said Gopi Shah Goda, director of the Retirement Security Project at the Brookings Institution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a cost-saving measure, benefits don’t have to be reduced across the board. If Congress lifts the cap on taxable income, for example, it doesn’t necessarily have to increase the maximum benefit that’s paid out to those who contribute the most into the system. And some of the additional revenue from the new taxes could be targeted to expand benefits for those —&nbsp;like surviving spouses or children —&nbsp;who rely on Social Security the most to stay out of poverty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, a program like Social Security should ensure that none of its recipients fall into poverty, especially because those who are retired or disabled have limited sources of income. That’s certainly a program worth spending more money on — and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/546890/americans-upbeat-future-social-security-benefits.aspx">the majority of Americans agree</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>I’d like to hear from you</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the first issue of <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/within-our-means-newsletter-us-poverty-politics-solutions">Within Our Means</a>, several readers reached out to talk about the relationship between disability and poverty, and how programs like Social Security fall short. For a future issue, I’m going to look into the flaws of how we deliver Supplemental Security Income — how hard it is to qualify, for example, or how the requirements make it impossible to save money — and I’d love to hear about your experiences.

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you think of what makes us human, would you say it’s our powers of prediction?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I probably wouldn’t have, at least not until my conversation with Mark Miller, a philosopher of cognition and research fellow at both the University of Toronto and Monash University in Melbourne. He studies how new ideas about the mind can provide insight into human well-being.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prediction is clearly useful: Being able to anticipate the future helps us strategize in the present.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But too much predictive power is usually the stuff of dystopian sci-fi stories, where being creative and unpredictable are the hallmarks of humanity, while the power of prediction —&nbsp;like the trope of an all-knowing algorithm — is cast as the weapon of technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, one of the latest big theories in neuroscience says that humans are fundamentally creatures of prediction, and not only is creativity not at odds with that, but it actually goes hand in hand with improving our predictive power. Life itself, in this view, is one big process of creatively optimizing prediction as a survival strategy in a universe otherwise tending toward chaos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Miller’s work starts with this big idea known as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/02/the-mind-expanding-ideas-of-andy-clark">predictive processing</a>, which says that your experience of the world is like a dream — a simulated model constructed by your brain. We’re not observing the world through open windows in our skulls. Rather, in our brain’s pursuit to plan, survive, and achieve our goals, it has learned how to guess what the world is actually like based on incoming sensory data. Those predictions are always uncertain, at least to a degree, which is why the goal of predictive processing is often <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/predictive-processing">described</a> as minimizing that uncertainty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But an optimal relationship with uncertainty calls for a balance. Through a predictive lens, Miller argues, uncertainty can help us snap out of harmful loops, like depression or addiction. And in general, it turns out that one of the best ways to become healthier, more adaptive creatures is to regularly expose ourselves to different kinds of uncertainty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Miller’s work goes on to use this idea to explain the value of everything from art and horror movies to meditation and psychedelics. In each case, we’re brought to “the edge of informational chaos,” where our predictive models begin to break down. Surprisingly, he sees creativity and optimizing our predictive powers as complementary forces that help sustain life itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I invited Miller as the next guest for <em>The Gray Area</em>’s series on creativity to discuss the paradox of how we humans survive thanks to prediction but need chaos in order to thrive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“All of life is this resistance to entropy,” Miller said. “As the universe expands and entropy is inevitable, life is that single force that’s defying that gradient.”&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, I&#8217;m looking out my window and I see a particular scene and, naively, it seems to me like the light is coming in from the outside, into my body, reaching my brain, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m seeing. What you&#8217;re telling me is actually what I&#8217;m seeing is the model being predicted by my brain. What happens, though, when the light actually does get passed through my body? Am I experiencing that at any point, or when do we switch from experiencing our predictions of the world to raw sensory data?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Probably never. That&#8217;s just not what you&#8217;re built to do. And actually you don&#8217;t need access to it. What you need is the driving signal from the world to be making sure that the models that you&#8217;re generating are elegant, sophisticated, and tracking real-world dynamics.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This does get dizzying the more you think about it. But this is a huge claim: that my experience of the world is not a direct experience of objective reality. It is my brain&#8217;s best guess of the world outside of my skull. How early-stage is predictive processing as a theory?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, not that early. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s irresponsible to say that it&#8217;s the preeminent theory today in all sorts of communities, computational <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(23)00411-X/abstract">psychiatry</a>, computational psychology, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcn.13138">neuroscience</a>. I mean, if it&#8217;s not the foremost theory, it&#8217;s adjacent. So I guess it&#8217;s a mix. It&#8217;s younger than the other, it is the new kid on the block in a way, but it&#8217;s a very popular new kid and very exciting.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You wrote a paper about how this predictive framework can explain a lot about what makes us humans happy. So tell me about that. What is the predictive account of happiness?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The human system starts predicting for one reason or another that the world is some way. And then the trouble looks like when that prediction becomes strong enough and divergent enough from the way things actually are. So we call it sticky — it has a sticky quality to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just think about depression. You&#8217;ve installed the belief for whatever reason that you just can&#8217;t fit with the world, that either it&#8217;s because you are not good enough or the world isn&#8217;t good enough. But for some reason you can&#8217;t resolve this difference between the way that you want the world to be and the way the world actually is, either because of something on your side or something on the world’s side. One thing that marks depression is that that belief persists even if the conditions were to change. Even if you were to change the situation entirely, there&#8217;s a sticky quality to these pathologies.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So let me ask you then about swinging back to the positive dimension, happiness in particular. That&#8217;s a picture of depression and psychopathology and mental illness. So what does this predictive framework say about the feeling of happiness itself?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I&#8217;m going to say two things. There&#8217;s a difference between momentary subjective happiness and well-being, like having a good life.&nbsp;Just in case anybody doesn&#8217;t know what these are, the momentary subjective being well-being is like hedonic well-being. That&#8217;s just the feeling good stuff.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow &nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is that like pleasure?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exactly. Overall well-being doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s exactly identical with that because to have a really rich, meaningful, good life may mean you&#8217;re in pain quite a lot. Momentary subjective well-being is a reflection, at least in part, of predicting better than expected. So we have this idea that valence is that good or bad feeling that comes as part of your embodied system telling you how it&#8217;s going. So when you feel good, that&#8217;s your body and nervous system and brain telling you, “I&#8217;ve got it. Whatever&#8217;s happening right now, I&#8217;m on top of it. I&#8217;m predicting it for us. I&#8217;m predicting it well. I&#8217;m managing uncertainty really well.” And when you feel bad, that&#8217;s an indicator: “I don&#8217;t understand something here.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How does creativity fit into this story?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think a starting point for thinking about creativity using this model is to start by maybe showing a puzzle. Why would a predictive system that looks like it&#8217;s trying to reduce uncertainty be attracted to situations and indeed make those situations where it&#8217;s bumping into uncertainty? Like why do we build roller coasters? Why do we go to horror movies?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the answer is that too much certainty is a problem for us, especially when that certainty drifts from real-world dynamics. So in order to protect our prediction engine, our brain and nervous system, from getting into what we&#8217;ve called the bad bootstrap, that is from getting very, very certain about something that&#8217;s wrong, it really behooves us to occasionally inject ourselves with enough uncertainty, with enough intellectual humility to be uncertain about your model enough that you can check to see whether or not you&#8217;ve been stuck in one of these bad bootstraps.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you&#8217;re with me to there, then we have a wonderful first-principles approach to thinking about the benefit of creativity and art, especially provocative art that calls you to rethink who you are. Because as far as we&#8217;ve seen, the research just keeps pointing in this direction, anything that gets you out of your ordinary mode of interacting with the world so that you can check to see how good it is or how poor it is, is gonna be a benefit for us. It&#8217;s gonna protect us from those bad siloed opportunities. I think art does that, right?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can go somewhere, see something grand, see something beautiful, see something ugly and horrible. If you let yourself be impressed by it, it can be an opportunity for you to be jostled out of your ordinary way of seeing the world, which would let the system check to see whether or not it&#8217;s running optimal models or not.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it sounds like you&#8217;re likening creativity to this injection of the right kind of uncertainty into our experience of the world. And in your <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rstb.2022.0425">paper on horror movies</a>, you used a term that I think captures a lot of this. It&#8217;s a thread that seems to run through everything so far: art, creativity, horror movies, even meditation and psychedelics. You wrote that the brain evolved to seek out the “edge of informational chaos” — a place where our predictive models begin to break down, and in those uncertain zones, we actually have much to learn.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It sounds to me like this edge of chaos actually explains at least one perspective on why art, why creativity, why play, why all these things benefit us. Because that edge is a really healthy place to be. So I wanted to ask you about this framing of the edge of informational chaos and why that&#8217;s a place that our brains would want to go.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Where are we gonna learn the most? If you are a learning system, and this is amazing, right from the lab, we see that animals and us, we get rewarded, not only when we get fed and watered and sexed, we get rewarded when we get better information. Isn&#8217;t that amazing to acknowledge?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you get better information, my system is treating it like I&#8217;ve been fed. That&#8217;s how important good information is for us. And in fact, in lots of situations, it&#8217;s more rewarding for us than the food itself because one bit of food is one thing. Information about how to get food over time, that could be much, much more important. So where do we learn the most?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, we don&#8217;t learn where our predictive models are so refined that everything is just being done by rote. And we&#8217;re not learning the most way out in deep volatility, unexpected uncertainty environments. That&#8217;s like where not only do you not know what&#8217;s going on, but you don&#8217;t know how to get to knowing what&#8217;s going on. That&#8217;s why we sometimes have culture shock if we move somewhere else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So where do we learn the most? We learn at this Goldilocks zone, which is that healthy boundary between order and chaos, right at the edge where our predictive models necessarily break down. And the hope there is that in breaking down, new, better models are possible.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;ve talked about how art and creativity can bring us to that edge of chaos, but you&#8217;ve also said elsewhere that meditation can do a similar kind of thing. Which is confusing at first because meditation looks pretty different from watching a horror movie. In meditation, I&#8217;m sitting there very quietly, in what looks like the opposite of chaos. So how do you understand what meditation is doing in this predictive framework, and how does that relate to creativity and these beneficial kinds of uncertainty?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This idea is common now, especially, in the West, that meditation might be more about relaxation, or maybe addressing stress. But that’s not the meat of the program. The center of that program is a deep, profound, and progressive investigation about the nature of who we are and how our own minds work. It’s a deep investigation about the way our emotional system is structured and the nature of our unconscious experience. What are we experiencing? Why are we experiencing it? What does that have to do with the world?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then we can adjust, progressively and skillfully, the shape of who and what we are so that we fit the world better, so that we are as close as possible to what’s real and true, so that we can be as serviceable as possible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, you can do everything that we’ve been talking about, including all the stuff that psychedelics do for the predictive system, all the stuff that horror and violent video games do, you can do it all contemplatively, in a way that’s better for you.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So you’re saying that one way to find that thread that puts meditation and horror movies in the same vein of practice is thinking about meditation and psychedelics as injecting uncertainty into our experience of the world. Is that the common currency there?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You&#8217;ve got it. Absolutely.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let me ask you this. After this whole story we&#8217;ve unpacked, there&#8217;s still a tension that leaves me a little bit uncomfortable. It feels like we&#8217;re saying that creativity is just kind of an input or a means toward juicing the powers of prediction. And part of me pushes against that. It almost feels reductive, right? Is creativity really just this evolutionary strategy that makes us better predictive creatures? Does that make creativity feel less intrinsically valuable?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because when I think about creativity, at least in part it doesn&#8217;t just feel like a tool for survival that evolution has honed. Sometimes it feels like it’s that which makes life worth living, that it has intrinsic value of its own. Not as a tool for the predictive powers in my brain or the algorithms or whatever. So I&#8217;m curious if you feel this tension at all, and how you think about creativity being framed in the service of prediction.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So two things. One, even though we are excited by this new framework, I don&#8217;t think we need to be afraid of it being overly reductionistic. I mean, in a way, it&#8217;s radically reductionistic. We&#8217;re saying that everything that&#8217;s happening in the brain can be written on a T-shirt, basically.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the way that it actually gets implemented in super complex, beautiful systems like us, it shouldn&#8217;t make us feel like all of the wonderful human endeavors are simply explainable in a sort of overly simplified way. I don&#8217;t have any worry like that. I think if it turned out that life was operating over a simple principle of optimization —&nbsp;that&#8217;s the most beautiful thing I&#8217;ve ever heard, first of all, that all of life is about optimization. All of life is this resistance to entropy. That&#8217;s just what it is to be alive, is just your optimal resistance to entropy. As the universe expands and entropy is inevitable, life is that single force that&#8217;s defying that gradient. That&#8217;s so beautiful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two, when it comes to art, I want to even be careful to say that art is only about finding this critical edge. I think that&#8217;s one really interesting way of thinking about it. It&#8217;s one way that we&#8217;ve been thinking about it, if you consider movies and video games as forms of art also.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another central reason that this kind of system might benefit from artistic expression that we didn&#8217;t cover but that&#8217;s completely relevant for our discussion is that art creates this wonderful opportunity for endless uncertainty and uncertainty management. And not very many things do that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And as you progressively create dancing, painting, singing, whatever, the enthusiasm of that literally being in the spirit of that creative endeavor, is you managing uncertainty in a new and remarkable way that it&#8217;s never been done before in all of existence through all time. Nobody has ever encountered and resolved that uncertainty in particular. So it should be endlessly rewarding, fascinating.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No wonder we find it so beautiful. It might be by its very nature the purest expression of uncertainty generation and management. That would make it intrinsically valuable for an uncertainty-minimizing system like us.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the afternoon of October 10, author and influencer <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/11/20860607/caroline-calloway-natalie-beach-explained">Caroline Calloway</a> texted me “I lived bitch.” She posted a screenshot of the same proof-of-life selfie and message on her Instagram story that morning after Hurricane Milton made landfall. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;d spoken one day earlier about Calloway&#8217;s decision not to evacuate for the monster of a storm, as well as to post about that choice on social media, and at one point I asked if she thought she was going to die. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;Someday,&#8221; she told me, &#8220;We all are.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, she was aware of the massive storm surges Milton would bring in its wake that would likely wash away parts of the state. She knew it would inflict a wretched amount of emotional and monetary damage.<strong> </strong>For now, we don’t know Milton’s total devastation, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/10/hurricane-milton-live-updates-florida-aftermath-thursday/75599239007/">but as it stands</a> at least 14 people are dead and 3 million people are without power. Milton also spawned “dozens” of tornadoes across the state, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-tornadoes-florida-deaths-climate-change-oceans-f197c258022c189c6ce8bc59dc88223e">according to the Associated Press</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It was a really hard choice to stay or to go. And I didn&#8217;t make it lightly,” she told me, “But you know, if I can be of service in terms of entertainment on the internet? So be it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Calloway isn’t the only Floridian evacuation refuser who’s posting through it. On TikTok in particular, there are plenty. There’s the woman who told her followers that she was instructed to have enough food and water for three days and has decided that she will have “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@angeyb__/video/7423331321398988078">some kind of barbecue</a>” (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@angeyb__/video/7424308233575222571">she posted </a>that she was safe on Thursday evening). There’s a Floridian celebrity who goes by the name “<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/10/lt-dan-tiktok-hurricane-milton-sailor/75602596007/">Lt. Dan</a>” who safely rode out the storm on his boat. And then there’s the woman who did not want to <a href="https://x.com/offbeatorbit/status/1843851943434961039">leave her gigantic concrete house</a> because she wanted to “save” it and partly because her staying would, in her words, “piss” liberals off. (Her account now shows up as “<a href="https://x.com/alex_abads/status/1844573838694064482">banned</a>” on TikTok.)  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People defying evacuation orders isn’t a new phenomenon. But getting millions of views on TikTok for doing so is. So why are these people staying? And why are they posting?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The psychology behind staying and posting through a hurricane</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most important things to know about StormTok is that having the ability to leave and deciding to stay behind is a choice that most people who <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/377365/hurricane-milton-helene-evacuation-cost-expensive#">do not evacuate don’t have</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The real story is that most people who don&#8217;t evacuate can&#8217;t evacuate. Evacuation is expensive,” <a href="https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/geography-meteorology/about-us/facultyandstaff/calldavid">Dave Call</a>, a meteorologist and storm chaser based at Ball State University, tells me. Call explains scenarios in which people can’t take off from work, can’t afford hotels, don’t have reliable transportation, and can’t afford meals. Factors like not being able to speak English and being an undocumented immigrant also affect those contingency plans. Evacuation isn’t a feasible option for these people, and we rarely see their stories, Call stresses. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being able to stay and share what’s happening is essentially a luxury.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Call chases tornadoes, and he explains that there’s a slight difference between what storm chasers do and what these hurricane posters are getting at, even if they’re both technically documenting storms. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These people are different from tornado chasers because they aren&#8217;t driven by a desire to see exciting weather, but by other factors,” Call says. “They may not comprehend the scale of a hurricane. Some have put their lives into their home and feel that it is safe enough. There’s also overlap between these folks and those who drive through flood waters, refuse to shelter in storms, drive recklessly, etc.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Call is getting at is that there is a multitude of factors that goes into the psychological decision of staying in place and sticking out a hurricane like Milton. <a href="https://com.miami.edu/profile/barbara-millet/">Barbara Millet</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Miami, echoes that sentiment. Part of Millet’s research has focused on disaster communication and how the public understands the <a href="https://news.miami.edu/faculty/stories/2022/11/that-uncanny-coneresearchers-want-to-erase-the-uncertainty.html">dangers and risk of hurricanes</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Evacuation decisions are complex. They&#8217;re multifaceted and they&#8217;re personal. There&#8217;s no single reason, but rather a combination of factors that really influence individuals and families,” Millet tells Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She explains that these factors range from money to past experiences with hurricane evacuations to uncertainty about the forecast, to the perception that being at home might be safer. Disaster fatigue, the exhaustive process of rebuilding, the lack of trust in lawmakers and officials, and everything in between can affect someone’s decision not to obey evacuation protocols. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Maybe all these reasons don&#8217;t apply to any one given person, but there&#8217;s certainly a combination of them that influence people&#8217;s decisions to — or not to — evacuate,” Millet adds. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If there’s a reassuring aspect to these extremely viral videos of people hunkering down and ignoring evac orders, it’s that the reasons and motivations they’re citing line up with research. Scientists know that factors like expenses and lack of trust in officials are why people don’t evacuate and have been figuring out better ways to address those concerns. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The reasons that they were giving are the same reasons that turn up in most of our surveys. None of the stated reasons were a surprise in those videos,” says <a href="https://humanecology.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/cara-cuite/">Cara Cuite</a>, an associate professor at Rutgers University who studies risk and emergency communication. What caught Cuite and her colleagues by surprise was how popular the videos became. They wondered if that engagement could be another driving force in people’s decision-making.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Seeing these videos raises the question of whether there is a counterproductive incentive to stay and not evacuate in the form of driving engagement to people&#8217;s accounts,” Cuite adds. “We don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s happening, but it certainly raises that question.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In that same vein, what worries Millet and Call is that people posting their refusals to evacuate and garnering millions and millions of views in the process could be one of those factors that may sway <em>someone else’</em>s decision from evacuating to staying put. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Social media provides official information to be communicated to a larger group of people, but it also allows for unofficial information and misinformation to be communicated, and that&#8217;s what worries me most,” Millet tells me. “Misinformation and how that impacts people&#8217;s ability to take decisions, actions that they need to take.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why people are turning the hurricane into content&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Calloway’s decision to stay wasn’t prompted by a lack of information. She explained that she had been following Milton and all the news surrounding the storm but that mitigating factors like her inability to drive and her desire to care for older neighbors kept her staying put. She also details that her experience evacuating in 2022 for Ian also shaped her decision. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I decided the right thing for me and my immediate community was to stay,” Calloway told me. “They&#8217;re my first priority.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She explains that she had previously honored evacuation protocols for Hurricane Ian in 2022, fleeing to her mother’s house inland in Northport, Florida, and ended up needing a military rescue anyway. She added that she’s on the third floor of her concrete condo and that she has hurricane-proof windows.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She does admit that with all these posts, she is hoping to promote her latest project (“I’m going to be trapped inside for two days anyway — let&#8217;s sell some books. That’s sort of my attitude.”) which happens to be a book about <a href="https://carolinecalloway.com/products/elizabeth-wurtzel-and-caroline-calloways-guide-to-life">survival</a>. Judging by the many posts about whether or not Calloway would survive the hurricane, ironic admiration for Calloway’s insistence on promoting her new book, and the attention her posts from Milton’s eye have garnered, she successfully provided the internet with some form of entertainment. She’s also no stranger to the dangers of misinformation, including <a href="https://x.com/jackfromohio/status/1843755693058535758">rumors</a> of her living on the ground floor of her condo, which she says were made up by a “fucking idiot who’s blind.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not lost on Calloway that there’s a certain schadenfreude or a grim morbidity from people online watching her post, that much of this attention was glibly predicated on her possible demise. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The way the stubborn stayers on social media are consumed and recirculated speaks to both society’s rubber-necking and many viewers’ judgments about the posters’ reality. That these Floridians had the money and resources to leave and chose to stay rubs people the wrong way, but it also gets them very invested. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can’t help but be curious about the implied <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/20/18226699/jenna-jameson-keto-diet-weight-loss-photos-before-and-after">before-and-after picture</a> of it all. Some want to see if the lady’s concrete house gets wrecked or the woman having a barbecue in the wake of a storm surge realizes amid standing water that burgers and dogs are the last thing on her mind. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also the fact that, as Call, the meteorologist and storm chaser, points out, it’s simply hard to comprehend living in the destructive aftermath of a hurricane. Parts of Florida are still soaked from Helene, and it’s unclear how many days or even weeks Milton will leave the swaths of the state without electricity. Milton is going to strain Florida in ways that TikTok can’t capture. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Rebuilding from a hurricane is measured in years,” Call says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the part we don’t see and that won’t get millions and millions of views. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even when a life-threatening hurricane is headed your way, there are <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/25/16202296/hurricane-florence-2018-evacuation-psychology">many reasons why you might stay put</a>. You might have dependent family members who can’t leave due to disabilities or other health-related reasons; you might not have reliable transportation to get to a safer area, and what’s more, no gas to get there. Sometimes, you simply refuse to leave your home and everything you own behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also the reality of just not being able to afford it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a 2021 <a href="https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/documents/news-items/spa-hurricane-survey-results-2021.pdf">University of South Florida survey</a>, over half of the state’s residents said that finances would impact whether they evacuated from a hurricane or not, with almost 43 percent saying they had under $1,000 for emergencies. People escaping both Hurricane Milton and Helene — a Category 4 hurricane that heavily impacted the southeastern US in late September — report <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cnn/video/7423539550137371934">spending</a> <a href="https://x.com/DissentFu/status/1843373698243539317">hundreds</a> <a href="https://x.com/bulkpricing/status/1843734482698023161">if not</a> <a href="https://weartv.com/news/local/helene-evacuees-face-high-costs-as-they-seek-refuge-in-northwest-florida">thousands of dollars</a> to get to safety. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Connie Vickers, 63, typically resides about an hour outside of Asheville, North Carolina. It cost her about $5,000 to book the first available Airbnb she could find to evacuate from Hurricane Helene. She considers herself fortunate — she could pay that out of pocket, with the hope that her insurance would cover some or all of the cost. “I’ve been thinking about the socioeconomic differences,” she tells Vox. She knows that others aren&#8217;t able to pay these high costs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Terrifyingly, anecdotes of people seeing <a href="https://x.com/silverfang09/status/1843638806840520771">outrageous</a> <a href="https://x.com/iowaradioguy/status/1843362951593660813">flight</a>, <a href="https://x.com/hurricanetrack/status/1843482275490787568">hotel</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/KellDA/status/1843458416070783099">rental car</a> prices have spread like wildfire on social media in the lead-up to Hurricane Milton’s landfall as a Category 3 storm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On TikTok, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mamamossof6">one woman in Southwest Florida</a> has been explaining why it’s so difficult to leave home with six children and four dogs. Many shelters <a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/disability/evacuations-and-shelters/shelter-information/sheltering-with-pet/">don’t accept pets</a>. “I would have to book an Airbnb or something,” she says in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mamamossof6/video/7422814373627940139">one video</a>. “I can’t afford to do that.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Flights, hotels, or gas can be pricey — if they’re even available</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The longer someone waits to evacuate, the costlier evacuation is likely to be. One <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264879191_Is_It_Time_to_Go_Yet_Understanding_Household_Hurricane_Evacuation_Decisions_from_a_Dynamic_Perspective">2011 study</a> estimated that evacuation costs for a Category 3 hurricane could increase from $454 about three days before expected landfall to $526 mere hours before landfall, which is about $632 to $732 in today’s dollars. While the cheapest one-way flight from Tampa to Atlanta in mid-November can be had for just $39, according to Google Flights, on October 8, the cheapest the search engine showed was $321. The cheapest one-way ticket from Tampa to NYC, usually available for $45 to $90, was $458.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plane tickets are priced dynamically, typically shooting up during busy travel periods and when you’re booking last-minute. A United spokesperson told Vox that the airline had implemented fare caps this past Sunday. “Since then, the average price for a one way, economy class ticket to our hubs from affected Florida markets was below $500,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. They also noted that the <a href="https://x.com/iowaradioguy/status/1843362951593660813/photo/1">viral screenshots</a> of $1,000-plus fares from Tampa to St. Louis included two stops. By early Tuesday, though, it was hard to find any nonstop flights from Tampa. <a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-waiving-fare-differences-capping-fares-new-bookings-ahead-milton">Delta</a> and <a href="https://skift.com/2024/10/09/airlines-cap-fares-during-hurricane-milton/">American Airlines</a> have also capped fares.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether these tickets actually existed is also a different matter — going directly to airline websites often showed that there were actually no available flights, since airports were closed and many flights had been canceled. By Tuesday, when many <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/09/florida-hurricane-milton-evacuation-orders-flood-zones-mandatory-list-map-orlando-counties-shelters/75588425007/">evacuation orders</a> were just going into effect, options were increasingly limited — and costly — for Floridians in the path of Milton. Many airports were <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/airports-close-and-flights-are-cancelled-due-to-hurricane-milton/3438303/">closing down</a>. As of Wednesday, FlightAware data showed that 90 percent of flights out of Tampa International Airport were canceled.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rental car locations were either running out of cars or shutting down for safety as of Tuesday, and <a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/home?search=tampa&amp;fuel=1&amp;method=all&amp;maxAge=0">according to GasBuddy</a>, a site that helps people track prices and availability at nearby gas stations, fuel was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/business/hurricane-milton-florida-gasoline-shortages/index.html">scarce</a>. Finding a place to stay is an uphill climb, too. At the time of writing, many hotels in <a href="https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/bay-county/panama-city/hurricane-milton-evacuees-fully-book-panama-city-hotels/">Northwest</a> <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/10/07/booked-up-tallahassee-hotels-see-influx-due-to-hurricane-milton/75555745007/">Florida</a> had filled up. While there are free shelters available across Florida counties where evacuation orders have been issued, as well as free <a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/Updates">shuttle services</a> or other <a href="https://www.wptv.com/weather/hurricane/need-transportation-heres-how-you-can-get-a-ride-to-a-local-shelter-or-to-safety">free transportations options</a>, not everyone may be in an area where they can access them. There are also several reasons why people choose <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2024/10/09/evacuating-privilege-why-some-stay-behind-when-hurricanes-strike">not to go to a shelter</a>: They may not be sure exactly where it’s located, whether it’s full, or may not be able to bring their pets. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Being poor and having few job protections makes it harder to escape a storm</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People with the least money are also often <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5050132/">least likely to be able to escape</a> a natural disaster. They are less able to leave work in advance to beat traffic or book lodgings and flights before they’re all sold out, and in the long term, less able to permanently move to an area at lower risk of hurricanes — yet another example of how it can be <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-cost-of-being-poor-is-rising-and-its-worse-for-poor-families-of-color/">more expensive to be poor</a>. The Gulf Coast faces some of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4022458/">highest poverty rates</a> in the US, and the combination of extreme poverty and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600389/">higher rates of poor health</a> (often due to racial inequality and environmental factors) leaves residents in this region <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-part-of-the-u-s-will-suffer-most-from-climate-change/">especially vulnerable</a> during disasters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carson MacPherson-Krutsky, a research associate at the Natural Hazards Center at University of Colorado Boulder, is currently studying the factors that motivate people to evacuate and shelter — or not — for hurricanes and tornadoes. “A huge one is resource constraints,” she tells Vox. “You have to have lodging wherever you&#8217;re going. You may need to have social support, potentially, if you want to stay with family and friends who are outside of the area. You have to have the ability to leave your job.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even in ordinary times, hotel and flight prices can be tough to stomach. Average hotel prices in the US have <a href="https://lodgingmagazine.com/j-d-power-2024-nagsi-study-shows-travelers-are-paying-more-for-hotel-rooms/">risen this year</a>; across the country, it has become increasingly common to pay <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/average-hotel-room-prices-data-a0afa164">upward of $200 per night</a> for a room. The cost of buying a car, maintaining it, and having insurance for it has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/your-money/car-ownership-costs-increase.html">gone up precipitously</a> in the past few years. Then there are the <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/23641875/food-grocery-inflation-prices-billionaires">higher food prices</a> to consider. If you’ve evacuated to temporary lodgings and don’t have a stove, eating out can quickly become costly. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over a quarter of Americans had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/americans-checking-account-balance/">less than $500</a> in their checking account last year, according to a CNBC Select survey, and over half of Americans have less than $1,000 saved for emergencies. A <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/hurricane-irmas-coming-what-an-average-family-spends-and-does-to-prepare">Fox Business report from 2017</a> estimated that hurricane preparation and evacuation could cost an average family as much as $5,000; a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/18/multimedia/hurricane-florence-motel-evacuees.html">New York Times report</a> from 2018, when Hurricane Florence ravaged North Carolina, cites one family having to cough up over $2,000 to evacuate. It can be prohibitively expensive to survive a storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some, the risk of lost wages or other <a href="https://x.com/HorrorGorl/status/1843684304385143005">consequences</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@officialladdyyg/video/7423010068448382254?_r=1&amp;_t=8qPCtDRp5ac">of missing</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees/comments/1fyyp5z/usa_what_to_do_because_were_being_forced_to_work/">work</a> may have influenced their <a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/09/hurricane-ian-workers-rights-laws.html">decision to stay put</a>. During Hurricane Helene, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/05/us/tennessee-impact-plastics-factory-helene/index.html">factory called Impact Plastics</a> in Erwin, Tennessee, allegedly told employees to continue working despite flood warnings in the area. The company denies that it discouraged employees from leaving, saying in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_DzP__-9kg">video statement</a> last week that they had been told to leave “at least 45 minutes before the gigantic force of the flood hit the industrial park.” It’s currently being investigated after 11 workers went missing, at least <a href="https://www.wcyb.com/news/local/bodies-of-5-of-6-impact-plastics-employees-swept-away-by-flood-recovered">five</a> of whom have since been found dead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How the government — and some companies — are trying to help</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To ease some of the costs of evacuation, the state of Florida has <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/07/governor-ron-desantis-suspends-tolls-to-assist-hurricane-milton-evacuations/">suspended road tolls</a> and has encouraged hotels to <a href="https://frla.org/news-release/frla-works-with-state-of-florida-to-encourage-reduced-costs-at-hotels-for-milton-evacuees/">waive pet fees</a>. Uber, which famously came under fire for <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/uber-reaches-agreement-with-n-y-on-surge-pricing-during-emergencies/">surge pricing</a> in New York during Hurricane Sandy, is giving people fleeing Milton <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-floridia-free-uber-rides-shelters/75567254007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-floridia-free-uber-rides-shelters/75567254007/">free rides to shelters.</a> Major US airlines, including <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/travel/trip-planning/travel-alerts.html">United</a>, <a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/travel-alerts.jsp">American</a>, and Delta are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/hurricane-helene-disrupting-travel-fliers-need-know-rcna173505">waiving some fees</a> if you need to rebook a flight. A few hotels have also been offering “distress rates” for evacuees, with <a href="https://www.wmbfnews.com/2024/10/08/myrtle-beach-resorts-offer-discount-those-evacuating-hurricane-milton/">one Myrtle Beach resort</a> charging as little as $39 per night before taxes, and rooms at an <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/rosen-hotels-resorts-reduces-pricing-hurricane-milton/WEDJTZ47IFE6JP6XNOI2VBMRKE/">Orlando area hotel chain</a> starting at $69 before taxes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The supply-and-demand explanation for why things like flights and hotels can cost more during emergencies is that a lot of people are trying to snap them up at the last minute. That doesn’t mean it’s in a company’s best interest to hike prices, especially when people have been airing their sticker shock online. In some cases, it could even be illegal price gouging.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Price gouging is different than a normal market increasing prices,” says Teresa Murray, director of the Consumer Watchdog office at the Public Interest Research Groups. It usually needs to occur during some kind of emergency, and only applies to essential goods. One clear example of price gouging, according to Murray, happened during the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/5/12/23068472/baby-formula-shortage-2022-why">baby formula shortage</a> in 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/how-to-report-price-gouging-after-a-natural-disaster/">37 states</a> have some sort of anti-price gouging law in the books. Florida’s anti-price gouging law doesn’t kick in unless an official state of emergency has been declared, which Gov. Ron DeSantis did <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/05/emorandum-executive-order-number-24-214-emergency-management-tropical-storm-milton/">this past</a> <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/05/emorandum-executive-order-number-24-214-emergency-management-tropical-storm-milton/">weekend</a>. If the price of food, water, or gas, for example, “grossly exceeds” the average prices seen in the 30 days before the state of emergency, that’s illegal — but it’s not clear what “grossly exceeds” exactly means. <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/pricegougingduringdisasters#2C">Some states</a> set a price increase threshold, such as anything more than 10 percent above normal prices. The Florida attorney general’s office has urged residents to <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-moody-extends-price-gouging-hotline-following-declared-state-emergency">report any price gouging</a> they see; it was already <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/florida-attorney-generals-team-investigates-price-gouging-amid-hurricane-season/">investigating potential price gouging</a> after receiving hundreds of complaints during Hurricane Helene. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg <a href="https://x.com/SecretaryPete/status/1843464151324389620">said on X</a> that the Department of Transportation is “keeping a close eye on flights in and out of areas affected by Hurricane Milton” to ensure there’s no price gouging, and the department is now <a href="https://x.com/petemuntean/status/1843740317494964379">in touch with airlines</a> about the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Typically, Murray adds, we see a lot of <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/after-a-hurricane-or-tropical-storm-watch-out-for-repair-scams-price-gouging-unsafe-generator-use/">price gouging</a> — whether it’s water, food, or supplies needed for clean-up and repair, like chainsaws — happening in the aftermath of a disaster. With Milton, too, we might see more of it occurring as recovery efforts begin. “It’s just unconscionable that some companies might be taking advantage of this crisis by jacking up their prices,” Murray says. “We&#8217;re talking about people&#8217;s lives here.”</p>

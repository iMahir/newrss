<p class="has-text-align-none">At her first major campaign rally since becoming the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris made a relatively unexpected promise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking in Atlanta to a crowd of 10,000 supporters, Harris <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1818428966559944924">pledged</a> to “take on corporate landlords and cap unfair rent increases.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s remarks to cap rents echoed a recent proposal from the Biden administration just two weeks earlier <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/07/16/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-major-new-actions-to-lower-housing-costs-by-limiting-rent-increases-and-building-more-homes/">to limit rent hikes to 5 percent nationwide</a> over the next two years for all landlords who own more than 50 units. (They estimate this would cover over 20 million units across the country.) The Biden plan — which would require congressional approval — would exempt not-yet-built units, so as to not discourage much-needed new housing. The two-year rent cap, Biden officials said, would serve as a way to drive down costs while new housing was under construction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s seeming embrace of the Biden plan isn’t the first time she’s expressed support for rent control. In 2019, after Oregon adopted a then first-of-its-kind statewide rent control measure, she tweeted in praise of the bill signing. “No one should ever have to choose between paying their rent each month or feeding their children,” Harris wrote. As a senator, she also introduced legislation to offer tax relief to renters who earned less than $100,000 if they spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it wasn’t clear Harris was going to stick to a pro-renter position on the presidential campaign trail — she’s already abandoned several more left-wing stances she previously embraced while a candidate in 2020. Over the last ten days, Harris has <a href="https://x.com/sahilkapur/status/1818823545650307532">rejected Medicare for All</a>, distanced herself from a <a href="https://x.com/zhalaschak/status/1818733192846737476">federal jobs guarantee</a>, and said she would <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kamala-harris-fracking-energy-oil-gas-biden-administration-9dd5a023">no longer oppose fracking</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when it comes to affordable housing, Harris has so far stuck closely with the political playbook of the president, who started <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24113340/biden-housing-2024-election-campaign-renters-tenants-mortgage">campaigning on lowering housing costs</a> more aggressively this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2024.pdf">22 million households</a> now spend more than a third of their income on rent, and home mortgage rates <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MORTGAGE30US">have soared since 2022</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rent caps, however, have <a href="https://www.vox.com/22789296/housing-crisis-rent-relief-control-supply">long been controversial among economists</a>, most of whom argue that the policy hurts housing markets and ultimately limits supply, thus driving costs up further. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051137724000020?via%3Dihub">review</a> of more than 200 empirical rent control studies released in March found a “wide range of adverse effects” for communities with rent caps, and that landlords were more likely to allow rent-capped units to fall into disrepair.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, a growing movement of housing activists has been pressing federal lawmakers to embrace the policy, citing the imminent <a href="https://www.vox.com/23140987/evictions-housing-rent-assistance-erap-tenant">threat of displacement</a> many tenants face. More than 650,000 people in America experience homelessness on any given night, and federal data <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/ahar/2023-ahar-part-1-pit-estimates-of-homelessness-in-the-us.html">published in late 2023</a> showed a rise in homelessness in most states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From a campaign perspective, rent caps poll quite well. In <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Navigator-Update-05.23.2024.pdf">one May survey published by Navigator,</a> a Democratic-aligned research group, pollsters found most voters overwhelmingly support cracking down on rent-gouging by corporate landlords, and cracking down on misleading rental fees. Measures to build more homes as a way to drive affordability were far less popular with voters, by contrast, than providing financial aid to renters and regulating rents.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The rent cap pledge didn’t come out of nowhere</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s announcement in mid-July to embrace rent caps <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/2/23485957/housing-banks-corporate-single-family-renters-landlord">on “corporate landlords”</a> came from mounting political pressure, and a sense that he needed to do more to court voters who were feeling badly about the economy and their daunting housing costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Redfin-commissioned survey from February <a href="https://spectrumnews1.com/ky/louisville/affordable-housing/2024/03/12/housing-affordabiilty-could-affect-who-voters-pick-for-president--study-says">found almost two-thirds</a> of homeowners and renters said that housing affordability made them feel negatively about the economy. Other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/05/upshot/polls-biden-trump-2024.html">surveys have suggested</a> that many of the young people and voters of color who helped Biden win in 2020 were now wavering in their support for him, and those voters are more likely to be renters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Activist pressure came largely from the Tenant Union Federation, a national group that seeks to mobilize renters to advocate for higher standards. This group, formerly known as the <a href="https://prospect.org/power/2023-02-09-tenants-rental-housing-policy/">Homes Guarantee Campaign</a>, had successfully pushed the Biden administration to release a non-binding “blueprint” for a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/White-House-Blueprint-for-a-Renters-Bill-of-Rights.pdf">renter’s bill of rights in January 2023</a>, and since turned its sights to rent control. Activists were specifically interested in rent control Biden could enact without going through Congress, and homed in on the <a href="https://www.fhfa.gov/">Federal Housing Finance Agency</a>, which regulates the entities that issue billions in government-backed mortgages every year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In January 2023, these activists helped <a href="https://bowman.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20Biden%20Admin%20on%20Rent%20Inflation_Warren%20Bowman_01092023.pdf">push a Congressional letter</a>, led by Democrats, asking Biden to take on corporate landlords and end “price gouging in the real estate sector.” The leaders proposed a suite of executive actions the government could take, with their top recommendation to direct the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish new renter protections, including rent caps.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By July 2023, <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/brown_letter_to_fhfa_on_tenant_protections.pdf">a new letter from Democratic senators</a> directly urged the Federal Housing Finance Authority to enact “limits against egregious rent hikes” in properties with government-backed mortgages.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While most economists have long warned about negative effects of rent control, tenant activists <a href="https://peoplesaction.org/wp-content/uploads/Economist-Sign-on-Letter_-FHFA-RFI-Response-1.pdf">and their progressive allies in academia and law</a> have been working to challenge perceptions that rent control inevitably hurts housing markets. They point to the debate around the minimum wage, where for decades economists argued that raising the wage would invariably hurt workers and the economy, yet more recently researchers <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25434/w25434.pdf">have determined</a> that such increases can actually be effective at boosting living standards for low-wage workers with little to no impact on job loss. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates argue that empirical studies are similarly challenging the conventional wisdom that rent control limits new construction or the overall supply of housing, and they point to examples in <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229489080_Thirty_Years_of_Rent_Control_A_Survey_of_New_Jersey_Cities">New Jersey</a>, <a href="https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/publications/housing%20market%202014.pdf">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="https://www.cura.umn.edu/research/minneapolis-rent-stabilization-study">Minneapolis</a>, and <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/blog/rent-control-the-key-to-neighborhood-stabilization/">California</a> to make their case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://peoplesaction.org/wp-content/uploads/Homes-Guarantee-Memo_-Housing-Supply-_-Case-Studies.pdf">a letter</a> the Tenant Union Federation sent to the Federal Housing Finance Agency last fall, activists noted that 182 cities and municipalities across the country had some form of rent regulation as of 2018, and California, like Oregon, had passed new statewide rent limits in the last five years.<br><br>Despite successfully pushing federal lawmakers to embrace potential new renter protections and even rent control, Biden and, so far, Harris have declined to go as far as the Tenant Union Federation wants. Some activists, for example, oppose the idea that rent caps would be temporary and exempt new units. The president also declined to endorse a plan that relied solely on his own executive power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The whole fact that [Biden] went to Congress to deal with it is messed up,” Elizabeth Olvera Perez, a tenant and leader in the Louisville Tenants Union, <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/biden-rent-cap-organizers-say-whats-next/">told the Nation recently</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tara Raghuveer, the director of the National Tenant Union Federation, praised Harris’s announcement in Atlanta, <a href="https://x.com/taraghuveer/status/1818451482301120678">acknowledging that</a> it had not been a given that it would be a priority for the vice president. “Rent caps are a winning issue,” <a href="https://x.com/taraghuveer/status/1818453997088309521">Raghuveer tweeted</a>. “Candidates up and down ballot should take heed.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Most economists remain against rent control</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Skeptics of rent caps point to St. Paul, Minnesota, as a cautionary tale.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In November 2021, St. Paul voters <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/St._Paul,_Minnesota,_Question_1,_Limits_on_Rent_Increases_Initiative_(November_2021)">approved a ballot measure</a> to cap annual rent increases at 3 percent for most apartments in the city, beginning in May 2022. (The city council loosened this policy in September 2022, to <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2022/09/21/st-paul-city-council-amends-rent-control-exempts-new-construction-exemption-with-5-2-vote/">exempt new development</a> for 20 years.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Developers and investors <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2021/11/09/as-investors-cry-foul-st-paul-mayor-carter-still-bullish-on-altering-not-ending-rent-control-but-city-council-has-its-doubts/">sounded the alarm</a>, and a year into the experiment, the federal housing department reported that new building permits in St. Paul had plummeted nearly 50 percent compared to a year before, while those in nearby Minneapolis were up 16 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">St. Paul planning officials <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2023/04/23/by-hud-counts-st-pauls-apartment-construction-permits-fell-48-after-rent-control-was-it-temporary/">said they weren’t jumping to any conclusions</a> about whether rent control was responsible for the declining construction, and reported their own permitting numbers were somewhat higher. (Tenant activists also argue it’s too soon to legitimately assess the policy’s impact.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, opponents and conservative intellectuals say St. Paul is confirming their worst fears that rent control will make housing more expensive in the aggregate, even if it provides relief to some existing renters in the short term.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservatives characterize Biden and Harris’s new embrace of rent control as further evidence that the administration is <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/26/opinion/joe-biden-kamala-harris-push-rent-control-a-great-way-to-destroy-cities/">against landlords</a>. Writing in City Journal,<em> </em>Manhattan Institute senior fellow Judge Glock argued that he doubts the Biden administration’s proposal would actually be limited to just two years. “Almost all rent control laws make such promises; governments often can’t help themselves and keep expanding the laws’ reach anyway,” he said, pointing to <a href="https://www.matthews.com/the-history-and-workings-of-nyc-rent-regulation/">New York City’s experience</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even some prominent liberals have come out against the Biden administration’s new embrace of rent caps.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Rent control has been about as disgraced as any economic policy in the tool kit,” Jason Furman, the top economic adviser to the Obama administration, recently <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/15/rent-cap-biden-housing/">told the Washington Post</a>. “The idea we’d be reviving and expanding it will ultimately make our housing supply problems worse, not better.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Colorado’s Democratic governor, Jared Polis, <a href="https://x.com/jaredpolis/status/1812931802899837095">echoed the criticism</a>, saying Biden’s plan “would lead to less affordable housing being built and substantially increase housing costs.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Legislative tea leaves suggest that Congress is likely to move forward with some sort of federal housing package next year. If Democrats sweep in November, and Harris continues to champion rent control, a national rent-cap policy looks a lot more likely. Whether that takes the form of a broad restriction on corporate landlords, or something more targeted to properties with government-backed mortgages is less clear. However, if Republicans retain control of at least the House or Senate, then the odds of rent caps being passed through Congress are virtually nonexistent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tenant activists, meanwhile, will continue to pressure Biden, and Harris, to use presidential executive authority to limit rent hikes. At this point, it’s unclear whether Harris would embrace such a move if she wins the election, even as her boss has thus demurred. The Harris campaign did not return a request for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How much is the future worth?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Usually to answer that question, you’d need to ask philosophers or economists. But if you’re a tech CEO, you <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/will-the-1-trillion-of-generative-ai-investment-pay-off">have an actual number</a>: about $1 trillion.<br><br>That’s how much the tech industry as a whole is set to spend building out the artificial intelligence industry over the coming years. And even in Silicon Valley, where several companies have market capitalizations that start with “T,” a trillion dollars is a lot of money. And while you won’t find more fervent evangelists for AI anywhere than in the C-suite of companies like Google and Microsoft, eventually, all that money has to be recouped. The alternative would be an economic meltdown of the sort we haven’t experienced for years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which may just well be in the process of happening.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, the stock market continued days of heavy losses, with the S&amp;P down 3 percent by the close of day. The blood-letting was led by many of the same tech companies that had driven the market to record highs in recent months, with AI chip maker Nvidia falling by nearly 7 percent, and Amazon dropping 4 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a lot of reasons why the bottom has at least temporarily fallen out of the market, including the possibility that the Federal Reserve has been too slow to cut interest rates in the face of a weakening US economy. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-nikkei-economy-c6240977e9482bf7207abc53b2a11e58">Recent data around US hiring and manufacturing activity have come in weaker than expected</a>, helping to fuel this sell-off.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are real concerns that despite the hundreds of billions that have been spent so far to build up the AI industry, and the hundreds of billions that are projected to be spent in the years to come, AI companies themselves aren’t yet producing much in the way of economic value. And they may not for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That sound you hear could be an AI investment bubble going pop. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Big AI dreams</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No one spends a trillion dollars on something unless they really, really believe in it — and Silicon Valley really, really believes in the transformative economic potential of AI. Way back in 2018, when ChatGPT was just a twinkle in the eye of OpenAI’s Sam Altman, Google CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/1/19/16911180/sundar-pichai-google-fire-electricity-ai">famously told</a> Kara Swisher that “AI is one of the most important things humanity is working on. It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fire, I think we can all agree, is pretty important. You might even think of it as humanity’s first breakthrough product. But to tech leaders like Pichai, the possibility of effective, general artificial intelligence was every bit as revolutionary as the day when one of our Paleolithic ancestors rubbed two sticks together. And once OpenAI released ChatGPT in November 2022, exposing the world to the genuine magic that is large language models (LLMs), the race was on to become the company that could capture that fire.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So investors rushed to fund promising LLM startups like OpenAI (currently <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/openai-valued-80-billion-deal-224312281.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9jaGF0Z3B0LmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMZ_s3_wCtj-aLk_d9EndIpQLhCJyF9behfY_3PO2jZ564ZiMiKmwzIjKk8C2RbomHsxS1EqBorAgGhwwNZDRMat5OK6nVRMyA4yKWgWBcwkl8Mf46dtCalNL7kOlua0hN3cApYvxJSU6yZG-HABQYXyKAP2fOoLMUZYAHA5JOl0">valued</a> at $80 billion or more) and Anthropic (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/27/amazon-spends-2point7b-on-startup-anthropic-in-largest-venture-investment.html">estimated</a> at $18.4 billion). In the US alone, AI startups <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/us-startup-funding-doubled-openai-anthropic-2023/">raised</a> $23 billion in capital in 2023, and more than 200 such companies around the world are unicorns — meaning they’re valued at $1 billion or more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All that money is in part a measure of tech’s confidence that the AI market will eventually prove titanically huge. One <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html">forecast</a> by the consultancy PwC estimated that AI could add nearly $16 trillion — there’s that word again — to the global economy by 2030, chiefly from vastly enhanced labor productivity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Add in the fact that tech giants have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/05/how-markets-biggest-companies-manage-cash-and-investments.html">plenty of cash on hand</a>, and are <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/">actively racing</a> against each other to be first past the post when it comes to AI. If you believe the AI industry will be worth trillions — and that the lion’s share of that value will go to the early leaders — then as Pichai <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/tech/wall-street-asks-big-tech-will-ai-ever-make-money/index.html">said</a> on a recent earnings call, “the risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the bill is rising, because generative AI is not cheap — both to build and to run.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When the bill comes due</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sam Altman himself has <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt">said</a> that OpenAI is “the most capital intensive startup in history.” That’s because as models get bigger and bigger, they cost more and more to train. And that’s just the cost of making the models — running them is highly expensive as well. One analysis last year estimated that it cost OpenAI $700,000 a day <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-chatgpt-costs-openai-to-run-estimate-report-2023-4">to run ChatGPT</a>, chiefly in all that compute-intensive server time. And the more ChatGPT and other LLMs are used, the higher those costs rise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Silicon Valley may not have invented the saying “you have to spend money to make money,” it certainly lives by it. But the revenue these companies are bringing in, chiefly via subscriptions to their premium models, are just a fraction of their costs. The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-openai-could-lose-5-billion-this-year">reported recently</a> that OpenAI could lose as much as $5 billion this year, close to 10 times what it lost in 2022. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not a good trajectory, and neither is ChatGPT’s user numbers. Tech analyst Benedict Evans wrote recently that while many people and companies <a href="https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/7/9/the-ai-summer">try out</a> AI services like ChatGPT, far fewer stick with it. (Notably, ChatGPT’s usage seems to meaningfully dip during school holidays, just in case you were wondering who the power users were.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While what LLMs can do is impressive, especially compared to what seemed possible a decade ago, promises of artificial general intelligence that could replace whole classes of workers <a href="https://gigaom.com/2023/11/28/seven-reasons-why-generative-ai-will-fall-short-in-2024/">have yet to come true</a>. As it stands now, the industry as a whole seems to suffer from a classic Silicon Valley problem: It <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/product-market-fit">lacks product-market fit</a>. Chatbots aren’t yet a true product, and it’s not clear yet how big the market is for them. That’s why experts ranging from Wall Street banks <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/08/the-generative-ai-revolution-may-be-a-bubble/679345/">like Goldman Sachs</a> to tech VCs <a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/">like Sequoia Capital</a> have been throwing up yellow caution flags around the AI industry — and why investors seem to have begun heeding them.<br><br>None of this is to say that AI itself doesn’t still have revolutionary potential, nor that the industry won’t eventually fulfill those dreams. The dot com crash in the early 2000s was in part due to overinvestment and overvaluation of startups of the era, but Evans notes that what was left over set the stage for mega-companies of today like Google and Meta. The same may one day be true for AI companies. But unless the financials improve, it may not be these AI companies. <br><br> <em>This story originally appeared in </em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Today, Explained</a></em></strong><em>, Vox’s flagship daily newsletter. </em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/today-explained-newsletter-signup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign up here for future editions</a></em></strong><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bangladesh’s increasingly autocratic leader, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, resigned and fled the country Monday following weeks of unrest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hasina’s exit on an India-bound military helicopter <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/8/5/bangladesh-pm-hasina-quits-and-flees-as-protestors-storm-palace-reports">came after crowds broke a curfew and stormed the prime minister’s residence in the capital Dhaka</a>, following weeks of bloody protest.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The movement that ultimately toppled her started with students frustrated at their lack of job prospects and snowballed to include ordinary Bangladeshis facing increasingly tough economic conditions. But the jubilant scenes in the capital Dhaka come at great cost; around 300 people have been killed since the protests started in June, and the country’s future remains uncertain as a military-backed caretaker government steps in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After a decade and a half in power, Hasina’s legacy is complicated. On the one hand, her government built modern infrastructure and improved development opportunities, especially for the poor. But she also increasingly cracked down on the press, as well as the opposition, and as time went on, many forms of dissent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Army General Waker-uz-Zaman announced Monday that the military had taken control of the government; parliament is being dissolved, and the government is formulating a plan for fresh elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The country is going through a revolutionary period,”<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-protesters-call-march-dhaka-defiance-curfew-2024-08-05/"> Zaman said</a> in a national television address. “We request you to have faith in the army of the country. Please don’t go back to the path of violence and please return to nonviolent and peaceful ways.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though a people-power movement has won a victory in driving Hasina out, the young democracy is entering a period of major uncertainty; indeed, what happens next for Bangladesh is anyone’s guess.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How Bangladesh got to the breaking point</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hasina belongs to one of Bangladesh’s two political dynasties, which have traded power with each other since the country’s tumultuous and bloody founding in 1971. Her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was a freedom fighter frequently called the father of Bangladesh. He was assassinated in 1975, forcing Hasina to live in exile in India.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, boosted by her familial connections, Hasina was first elected prime minister in 1996, serving until 2001, when<strong> </strong>Hasina’s foil, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, was elected. Zia <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-protesters-call-march-dhaka-defiance-curfew-2024-08-05/">was released from house arrest Monday at the behest of President Mohammed Shahabuddin</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hasina and Zia, the head of the opposition Bangladeshi Nationalist Party and widow of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ziaur-Rahman">former Prime Minister Ziaur Rahman</a>, have been the only two elected leaders in Bangladesh since 1991. Until January, <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2024/01/the-bnps-islamist-dilemma/">the BNP was in a massive coalition against the Awami league with 19 other political parties</a> and boycotted the January 7 elections.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This intense polarization —&nbsp;Awami League versus everyone else —&nbsp;is part of the reason for the protests. Another part is economic. For the country’s many educated young people, a stable path has meant a job with the government, but that has been increasingly impossible. Protesters blame a quota system that reserved up to 30 percent of government jobs for relatives of soldiers from the 1971 war for independence —&nbsp;but which protesters complained benefited Awami League members and allies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hasina is credited for an economic boom shortly after she took office for the second time in 2008. “The government has had a relatively strong economic record over its 15 years in power,” <a href="https://www.usip.org/people/geoffrey-macdonald-phd">Geoffrey McDonald</a>, a visiting expert at the US Institute of Peace, told Vox. “There has been rising development, infrastructure developments, [increased] income rates, and a lot of human development indicators outrank many of its neighbors.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But “a lot of Bangladesh’s growth has been in areas like textiles, that are not a big employment stream for university graduates,” <a href="https://political-science.uchicago.edu/directory/Paul-Staniland">Paul Staniland</a>, a political science professor at the University of Chicago, told Vox. “So this quota system was seen as kind of artificially restricting the supply of jobs for educated folks.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But economic problems in Bangladesh are not limited to the middle class;  like many other countries in South Asia and around the world, Bengalis are suffering from high inflation — <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?locations=BD">around 9.9 percent</a> as of this writing — making it harder for ordinary people to afford the basics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politically, Bangladeshis were fed up, too; elections in 2018 and this past January were widely seen as being fraudulent, and people no longer felt that they had a voice in choosing a government that could respond to their needs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This process of an autocratic nation really deepens and lasts five or six years where Sheikh Hasina really goes after a lot of her enemies, whether they’re part of the BNP, whether they’re liberal dissidents, whoever — really kind of solidifying and personalizing her rule,” Stanliand said. “And so that kind of runs through the most recent election, which, you know, is widely viewed as deeply irregular.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those facts, as well as the government’s incredibly violent crackdown against the protesters, ignited a national movement that succeeded in ousting Hasina.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We were expecting some sort of crisis, but I was not thinking that she might leave because she’s a very strong character,” Fabeha Monir, an independent journalist living in Dhaka, told Vox. But the police response, “escalated in a way and then so much that it was intolerable, intolerable for the nation itself.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-student-protests-curfew-government-jobs-quota-9af35994b4855ffac9bd962861447cda">In mid-July</a>, crackdowns on the protesters started in earnest, with the police imposing a curfew and shoot-on-sight order. The government also blocked internet and mobile access. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bangladesh is in a historical transition — but no one knows what comes next</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Along with the founding of the state, the assassination of Hasina’s father, and the 1991 return to democracy, the protest movement and Hasina’s departure will be one of the defining events of Bangladesh’s history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Details of Hasina’s resignation and exile are still coming to light, but the protests could not have evolved the way they did —&nbsp;with thousands eventually breaching Hasina’s residence —&nbsp;without the military’s tacit agreement, or at least its refusal to crack down as Hasina wished.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“So many armed students died, and everybody started blaming our military,” Monir said. “So then they started supporting [the protesters for] a few days now.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The military has historically been powerful in Bangladesh, and though Hasina seemed to have corralled it a bit under her tenure, it still appears to have retained some independence, Staniland said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“My guess is, the military was not willing to kill hundreds or thousands of people to stop this next wave of protest that developed,” he said. “And that was the trigger for her to leave.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though there is genuine excitement about Hasina’s departure, there is also great concern for what happens next. In a best-case scenario for democracy, the caretaker government could ensure elections that lead to real, progressive reforms. That’s far from certain, however. The military could cling to power, or more right-wing, Islamist factions could seize the government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The great concern for now is the spread of more violence —&nbsp;this time, not just against protesters, but against supporters of the Awami League, particularly those belonging to minority groups.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bangladesh is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious state, <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/11/religion-and-bangladeshs-political-parties/">though the BNP</a> tends toward political Islam and is more conservative. The Awami League, which is secular, appeals to religious minorities in a majority Muslim society, as well as ethnic minorities like the Rohingya from Myanmar, which the Hasina administration made an effort to support when they began arriving as refugees in 2017.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think we’re likely to see a lot of retribution being taken out against local Awami League officials — police and security officials who defended the government,” MacDonald said. “Hindus are a historical vote bank of the Awami League. And there’s also just lingering tensions between religious communities in general.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/9/7/23862026/robert-f-kennedy-jr-presidential-campaign-republicans">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,</a> an independent presidential candidate perhaps best known for his anti-vaccine viewpoints and proclivity for spreading conspiracy theories, admitted he dumped a dead bear in New York’s Central Park back in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1820132549798347109">In a video Kennedy posted on X on Sunday,</a> he revealed that he’d left a bike and bear carcass in the park, hoping it would appear that a cyclist had killed the bear, and that it would be “amusing.” It’s a bizarre incident that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/nyregion/bear-cub-found-dead-in-central-park-was-hit-by-a-car-investigators-say.html">prompted major news coverage</a> at the time — and that spawned a years-long mystery about how the bear even got there. The story was set to become public as part of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/08/12/robert-f-kennedy-jr-profile-presidential-campaign">a long, critical New Yorker profile</a> of Kennedy, which featured the anecdote, and which seemed to have prompted Kennedy to share his side of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bear incident is also only the latest in <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/robert-kennedy-jr-shocking-history">myriad problematic acts</a> that Kennedy has been implicated in — including spreading <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-2024-president-campaign-621c9e9641381a1b2677df9de5a09731">medical misinformation</a> and allegations of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/us/politics/kennedy-sexual-assault-accusation.html#:~:text=In%20an%20article%20in%20Vanity,told%20The%20Post%20that%20Mr.">sexual misconduct</a>. He’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/08/us/rfk-jr-brain-health-memory-loss.html">previously made headlines</a>, too, after sharing that a parasitic worm had eaten part of his brain. Collectively, these disclosures have all added to a peculiar persona and haphazard policy positions he’s cultivated.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite his antics and controversial stances, Kennedy has managed to hang on to a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/04/rfk-jr-2024-election-harris-trump">winnowing base of support</a> that’s attracted to his anti-establishment positions, and that believes he’s the only candidate willing to tell it like it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A recent <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">FiveThirtyEight polling aggregation</a> shows Kennedy holding about 5.5 percent support in a general presidential election versus Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/biden-trump/">That’s down from the 10.3 percent</a> he received in March in FiveThirtyEight’s roundup, when President Joe Biden was still the presumed Democratic nominee.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Kennedy, progressive scholar Cornel West, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein all among those running as independent or third-party options, it is possible alternative candidates might help decide what is <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris">shaping up to be a close election</a> — especially in key swing states that have historically been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/president">won by small margins</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The RFK bear incident – and other strange positions – briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1820132549798347109">In the X video,</a> Kennedy says he was on his way to a falconing trip in the Hudson Valley, when he saw the car in front of him hit and kill a bear cub.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I pulled over and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear,” Kennedy explained. “It was [in] very good condition and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Kennedy, the falconing trip went long and he wasn’t able to make it home before having to run to a dinner in New York City. Because that dinner also took longer than expected, he wasn’t able to bring the bear back to his house prior to a flight he had that same evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Faced with these time constraints, Kennedy says he — and those around him — felt that his best option was to deposit the bear in Central Park, and make it look like a bike had killed the cub, because that “would be funny for people.” After doing so, Kennedy says he saw an explosion of news coverage about the incident the next day, and grew worried that he’d find himself in trouble with law enforcement, but never came clean about his involvement until now.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The discovery of the bear <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2014/10/06/bear-cub-found-dead-in-central-park-police-suspect-death-was-unnatural/">spurred an investigation into animal cruelty</a>, and raised questions about how the animal’s carcass made its way into New York City. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not the only concerning incident that has surfaced about Kennedy in the course of his presidential campaign — others have included everything from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/rfk-jr-eating-dog-vanity-fair/index.html">outrage over him supposedly eating dog</a> to serious allegations of sexual assault. Eliza Cooney, who previously worked as a live-in nanny for his family, alleges that Kennedy groped her in his home and touched her leg in a business meeting. Kennedy has said the piece featuring the sexual assault claim — which <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/robert-kennedy-jr-shocking-history">was published in Vanity Fair</a> — was “garbage,” but added that he wasn’t a “church boy.” After the Vanity Fair story published, Cooney shared a text Kennedy <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/12/rfk-sexual-assault-apology-eliza-cooney/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/12/rfk-sexual-assault-apology-eliza-cooney/">had sent her with The Washington Post</a>, which stated that he had “no memory of this incident,” but apologized for any actions that may have made her uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That same Vanity Fair story outlines a pattern of strange and disturbing behavior including sending friends nude photos of women and spreading conspiracy theories about everything from Covid-19 to President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, a pattern the New Yorker profile also highlights. “He can say some crazy shit,” his sister Rory Kennedy once said, according to the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/robert-kennedy-jr-shocking-history">Vanity Fair report</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy’s policy platform has focused heavily on incorrect, anti-vaccine statements linking childhood vaccines with autism, which has been widely <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/fact-checking-presidential-candidate-robert-f-kennedy-jr-on-vaccines-autism-and-covid-19/">debunked by physicians and scientists</a>. One of his organizations is also responsible for paying for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/13/majority-antivaxx-vaccine-ads-facebook-funded-by-two-organizations-study" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/13/majority-antivaxx-vaccine-ads-facebook-funded-by-two-organizations-study">a significant proportion of the ads on Facebook</a> promoting falsehoods about vaccines, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/11/us/robert-f-kennedy-jr-instagram-covid-vaccine.html">the New York Times reports</a>. And his stance has been tied to real damage: In one instance, Kennedy and his nonprofit boosted misinformation in American Samoa about vaccines and likely <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/07/how-rfk-jr-falsely-denied-his-connection-to-a-deadly-measles-outbreak-in-samoa/">contributed to a massive measles outbreak</a> in the region, <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/fact-checking-presidential-candidate-robert-f-kennedy-jr-on-vaccines-autism-and-covid-19/">FactCheck.org notes</a>. Kennedy has also spread conspiracies about Covid-19, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/15/us/politics/rfk-jr-remarks-covid.html">and falsely claimed that it was “ethnically targeted” </a>to avoid harming Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people. <a href="https://www.kennedy24.com/policies">On the campaign trail</a>, he’s channeled these stances into rhetoric about the importance of protecting people’s “health,” and the need to combat chronic illnesses and get toxins out of food. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kennedy has a small base of support that could play a role in the election</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The people who’ve supported Kennedy have been drawn to him for the same reasons that critics oppose him.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By and large his backers, who span the ideological spectrum, see him as speaking honestly about issues like vaccines in ways that they don’t see politicians in the two parties doing so. Similarly, they view him as someone who’s willing to call out the political establishment, and cite his past record of taking on big businesses as an environmental lawyer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“He’s not in that party structure. Those political parties are authoritarian and they don’t allow dissent. Anyone who speaks out against the Democratic orthodox is pushed out,” Kevin Nally, a Kennedy supporter and former Democratic voter, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rfk-jr-supporters-trump-deserters-ex-democrats-theyre-hungry-change-2024-05-19/">told Reuters</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also likely that some of his early support was due to the fact that he offered an alternative to Biden and Trump, both of whom came with their own baggage for many voters. Kennedy’s support appears to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">have declined</a> as Harris has entered the race, though it could still play a role in the election if he’s able to get on key swing state ballots — something his campaign is still working to do in <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2024/08/pennsylvania-robert-kennedy-jr-ballot-access-jill-stein-third-parties/">places like Pennsylvania</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, Kennedy’s campaign said that he had been approved to appear on the Michigan ballot, one of a handful of states that will be a crucial battleground. Previously, former President Donald Trump won Michigan in 2016 by just over 10,700 votes, or roughly 0.3 percentage points. And while Biden beat Trump by just over 3 percentage points in 2020, <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris">polls suggest</a> the state may look more like 2016 than 2020 this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Kennedy gets “1 percent in those battleground states that could be decided very narrowly, he could cause one candidate to lose the presidency, or another candidate to win,” University of Virginia political scientist Barbara Perry told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That dynamic&nbsp; has been evident in the past with third party candidates, including independent businessman Ross Perot in 1992, who was seen as siphoning off support from President George H.W. Bush, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein in 2016, who was seen as cutting into the backing of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. (Research suggests that neither <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23998347/ross-perot-rfj-jr-third-party-indepdendent-2024">Perot</a> nor <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/11/13576798/jill-stein-third-party-donald-trump-win">Stein</a> actually swung their elections, however.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polls suggest that Kennedy could actually have an impact on both parties, since his views run the gamut of more conservative ideas like anti-vaccine positions, and more climate-friendly proposals, like calling for companies to cover the costs of pollution. It’s possible, though, that he’s even more harmful to Trump — despite his Democratic roots — because of their shared stances on vaccine mandates and Covid-19 restrictions. And reports suggest that the former president’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/politics/trump-campaign-rfk-jr/index.html">campaign does have some concerns</a> about Kennedy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Global stocks plunged over the weekend amid fears that the US economy is faltering, and Monday, all three major US stock indexes were down significantly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-s-p-500-nasdaq-futures-dive-as-buffett-dumps-apple-yen-soars">more than 1,000 points</a>, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were both down more than 3 percent — marking the S&amp;P 550’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-08-05/asia-market-open">biggest one-day drop </a>since September 2022. The slides came after Japan’s Nikkei index had its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/asia-markets.html">worst day since its “Black Monday” crash of 1987</a>, dropping 12.4 percent, and as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/european-markets-stocks-data-and-earnings-as-volatility-continues.html">European markets</a> struggled as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The heavy losses signal that investors are rattled following <a href="https://apnews.com/article/economy-recession-jobs-unemployment-c7f1985b1ab3a7b781920c2693cd0438">reports last week</a> showing that the US had only added 114,000 jobs in July, below expectations of about 150,000, and that unemployment had risen to 4.3 percent — higher than any month since October 2021. These numbers are not in and of themselves a crisis: The unemployment rate is still relatively low, and the underperformance in hiring isn’t catastrophic, but both have been taken as signals that the US economy might be showing some cracks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even though many economists <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/economic-indicator-survey-recession-risks-april-2024/">projected that the US would avoid a recession</a> after the pandemic-induced economic slump, and despite the fact that it has done so, the reports reignited concerns that a US recession could still happen, wreaking disastrous potential impacts across the global economy. On Monday, Goldman Sachs raised its odds of a recession occurring in the next year from <a href="https://thehill.com/business/4811504-goldman-boosts-recession-odds-but-sees-limited-risk-of-downturn/">15 percent to 25 percent</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s impossible to say now how realistic those recession fears are. But it may be too early for panic. The US economy wasn’t just <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/354969/inflation-cpi-federal-reserve-biden-trump-election">supposed to be good</a> — it actually is in pretty good shape.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s certainly some slowing going on,” said Matt Colyar, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. “But the foundational things that made us relatively encouraged about the US economy — those things haven’t changed.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Is a recession coming?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rise in unemployment “spooked a lot of people,” Colyar said, because it triggered what is called the “Sahm Rule,” apparently indicating that a recession may be near.&nbsp; The rule is activated if the three-month average unemployment rate increases by at least half a percentage point from its low over the prior year. It has successfully predicted every US recession since 1970.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, the economist after which the rule is named, Claudia Sahm, isn’t convinced that the Sahm Rule will be a reliable predictor this time. The post-pandemic economy has so far defied other historical recession indicators: For example, most bond strategists polled by Reuters earlier this year said that the patterns they study have been so unusual that they <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/inverted-yield-curve-no-longer-reliable-recession-flag-strategists-say-2024-03-12/">no longer considered bond yield curves</a> to be predictive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If the Sahm Rule were to trigger, it would join the ever-growing group of indicators, rules of thumb, that weren’t up to the task,” <a href="https://apnews.com/article/economy-recession-jobs-unemployment-c7f1985b1ab3a7b781920c2693cd0438">Sahm told the AP</a> before the jobs report came out last week.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One reason the Sahm rule might not be as useful this time around is that the rise in unemployment isn’t being driven by layoffs but rather more people are entering the labor force. Strong growth in the labor supply isn’t necessarily a signal of a recession, Colyar said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[Unemployment] could keep growing,” he said. “But as of right now, the labor market isn&#8217;t flashing red as much as it&#8217;s just slowing down.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But a bad jobs report wasn’t the only thing driving the global market selloff; so-called <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/global-markets-rout-positioning-analysis-pix-2024-08-05/?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=One-Essential-Read&amp;utm_term=080524&amp;user_email=38572e447ae2b3a943d6423dd3d8ad89c2e154a588929a92468b7914f3f4e88f&amp;lctg=66464e6f30f1bc62c305003b">carry trades</a> may have also played a big role. These trades involve investors borrowing money in currencies that have low interest rates — such as the Japanese yen or Swiss franc — and using it to buy higher-yielding investments, such as US Treasury bonds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because the yen has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-05/intensifying-yen-rally-sinks-japan-stocks-rattles-global-market">increased in value by 11 percent against the US dollar</a> in a month, these trades are no longer as advantageous to investors. Though it’s difficult to say for certain in real-time, Colyar said that investors may be “unwinding those bets to minimize their losses” and instead putting that money in safe-haven securities such as US bonds, contributing to the Nikkei index’s crash. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Goldman Sachs has also cautioned about reading too much into recent market volatility. In its Monday analysis, the bank said that it sees recession risk as “limited,” that it does not “see major financial imbalances,” and that though it may have increased its projection on the risk of recession, there is plenty of room for the Federal Reserve to step in to protect the economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Fed is expected to cut interest rates as early as its September meeting — or unusually, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/rates-bonds/us-interest-rate-futures-price-inter-meeting-fed-cut-2024-08-05/">perhaps even before then</a> — and that would provide relief to borrowers and businesses. Now that inflation has come down to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/economy/us-cpi-consumer-inflation-june/index.html">near the Fed’s 2 percent target rate</a>, Moody’s Analytics is projecting two rate cuts before the end of the year in September and December, involving a gradual relaxing of high interest rates. That could go a long way in calming the stock market. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Households remain in good shape, and businesses have continued to hire solidly. And businesses and households have handled their debt relatively well,” Colyar said. “So we think that [the Fed] can unwind policy relatively slowly. … There&#8217;s some evidence that there is more resilience there than previously assumed.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris entered the presidential race a little over two weeks ago <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362277/kamala-harris-donald-trump-polling">as an underdog</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since then, Democrats’ vibes have been fantastic — and Harris’s polling has gotten better. But it hasn’t improved as much as you might think. At least not yet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Per polls, Trump is no longer the clear favorite to win. But Harris hasn’t taken a clear lead either. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html">Polling</a>, particularly in swing states, suggests an extremely close race that could go either way.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear: This is a major improvement for Democrats, as compared to where President Joe Biden’s numbers had been. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Late last year, Trump <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden">gained</a> a durable poll lead on Biden nationally and in nearly every swing state. For Democrats, erasing that lead is a very big deal, and it helps explain the Trump campaign’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f511c4ba-a7a6-4007-b91f-79a08f291d1d">flailing</a> of late. The Trump team <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-campain-election-2024-susie-wiles-chris-lacivita/678806/">thought</a> they were sure to beat Biden, and now they are no longer so sure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But a Harris win also looks very far from certain. That’s in part because, due to the magic of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/363256/kamala-harris-electoral-college-swing-state-polls">Electoral College</a>, national polls don’t determine the outcome, swing states do. And the state of play in swing states is murky.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-07-30/kamala-harris-erases-trump-s-swing-state-lead-in-2024-election-poll?sref=qYiz2hd0">Bloomberg/Morning Consult polls</a> were encouraging for Harris overall, showing her taking a big lead in Michigan and smaller leads in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Nevada. The catch is that they also showed Trump ahead in Pennsylvania and North Carolina, plus a tie in Georgia. If those polls were accurate, the election would come down entirely to Georgia’s outcome.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And other recent swing state polls — from <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4795508-harris-tied-trump-pennsylvania-michigan-wisconsin/">Fox</a>, <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4801296-trump-harris-polls-arizona-pennsylvania-georgia/">Public Policy Polling</a>, and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4790684-kamala-harris-polls-donald-trump-wisconsin/">Emerson</a> — have shown Trump continuing to hold small leads in most swing states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is possible that the sparse swing state polling has been slow to catch up to Harris’s improving national vibes — and that a set of new polls showing Harris gaining a clear advantage is right around the corner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in both 2016 and 2020, Trump performed significantly better in key Electoral College states than Democrats (and most pollsters) expected — enough to thwart Hillary Clinton’s popular vote win, and to very nearly thwart Biden’s. Harris’s main challenge will be to stop that from happening again.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris has been in a honeymoon phase. What will happen after the honeymoon ends?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The past two weeks have gone about as well as could have been expected for Democrats, and far better than many pundits predicted. With the messy process of pushing Biden aside completed, there has been a  joyful embrace of Harris as his replacement. Democrats believe they now have a real chance to win again. Despite being an incumbent vice president, Harris in some ways can be said to embody the new — a 59-year-old woman of color who has not been president before — in contrast to Trump, a 78-year-old former president. She has a claim to being the change candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has also benefited from quite positive media coverage. In part that’s simply because things have, objectively, gone well for her so far. But she’s also benefiting from what’s often called the “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301420722000800">honeymoon</a>” phenomenon, in which a newly elevated political leader gets positive press simply because of their newness. And the thing about honeymoons is that they eventually end.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance: When Harris was running in the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, her first debate — when she criticized Biden’s 1970s opposition to school desegregation busing in a moment that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/girl-senator-harris-vice-president-biden-spar-desegregation/story?id=64007842">went viral</a> — was tremendously successful, sending her <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/kamala-harris-polls.html">surging in the polls</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as the campaign went on, she struggled to sustain that momentum. Days later, she acknowledged that her views on modern busing policy weren’t any different from Biden’s. Later on, she <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/8/20/20813658/kamala-harris-bernie-sanders-medicare-for-all-2020">struggled to outline</a> a coherent health care policy. And her campaign “became a hotbed of drama and backbiting,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/03/politics/kamala-harris-2020-campaign/index.html">according to CNN</a>. She eventually dropped out of the race before voting began.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This time around, Harris has masterfully played the inside game in lining up party support for her campaign, she’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/04/us/politics/trump-harris-campaign-crowds.html">drawn enthusiastic crowds</a>, and she’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-fundraising-democrats-trump-fbc14aa926444b4f961f579c63811766">raised a gargantuan pile of cash</a>. But there are other things she hasn’t done yet. For instance: She hasn’t given an interview or press conference since Biden quit, which is something Republicans <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4806604-kamala-harris-hiding-press-republicans/">are grousing about</a>. Her choice of a running mate could also lead to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/us/politics/shapiro-aide-sexual-harassment.html">controversy</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats might hope the honeymoon can be stretched out for three more months. But inevitably, contentious issues will arise for Harris, as they do for all presidential candidates. Media coverage of her will turn at least somewhat less positive. Her campaign’s prospects will depend on how she weathers the storms that are sure to come.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When your phone makes that discordant shrill noise and a disaster alert pops up, do you know what to do? Do you have a <a href="https://www.globalsupport.harvard.edu/travel/advice/go-bag-checklist">go bag</a>? Do you have a place to crash for a few days? Do you have a way to get there? What about your kids or your pets? And if your home’s roof gets ripped off while you’re away, do you have enough cash to fix it? Have you thought about moving entirely? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For millions of Americans, these are not hypothetical concerns. It’s already been a dangerous, deadly year of <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24155885/tornado-season-twister-clustering">tornadoes</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358323/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intesification-caribbean-climate">hurricanes</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/29/us/park-fire-paradise-california-chico/index.html">wildfires</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/07/29/dollywood-flood-video/">floods</a> across the United States. At this point, such extraordinary disasters are hardly a surprise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Extreme weather events are becoming more common, dangerous, and destructive. <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-ii/">Rising average temperatures</a> are lifting sea levels, increasing the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous">volume of rainfall</a>, and making <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23805954/extreme-heat-waves-explained-climate-change-solutions">heat waves</a> more common. At the same time, more people are living in places vulnerable to hazards like <a href="https://apnews.com/article/flooding-population-development-climate-change-disaster-cfee396af85763e69c1527d4c95652f1">coastal floods</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/09/climate/growing-wildfire-risk-homes.html">wildfires</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The good news is that, in general, <a href="https://www.vox.com/23150467/natural-disaster-climate-change-early-warning-hurricane-wildfire">natural disasters are killing fewer people</a>. Humans are adapting with better infrastructure, better forecasting, better warnings, and better responses in the aftermath. These advances required people to take these risks seriously: to invest in upgrading structures, to spend years conducting research, and when a siren sounds or when an alert goes out, to seek shelter.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even in disaster-prone regions, though, complacency can set in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Memories of past calamities can fade quickly, while financial and policy incentives can push people to <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/360921/hurricane-beryl-houston-blackout-centerpoint-outage">rebuild in vulnerable areas or degrade natural protections against threats</a>. Even when a major storm is on the horizon, there are always some people who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/09/05/why-do-some-people-refuse-evacuate-during-hurricane-same-reasons-people-dont-listen-warnings-they-should-save/">decide to stay put</a>. Hurricane Ian in 2022 was one of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23389508/hurricane-ian-death-toll-storm-florida-landfall-climate">deadliest storms in US history</a>, and most of the casualties were people who <a href="https://www.abcactionnews.com/news/local-news/i-team-investigates/psychological-factors-affect-choice-to-evacuate-or-not-during-hurricanes">chose not to evacuate</a>. Residents cited a variety of reasons: it’s too expensive to leave, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/09/28/hurricane-ian-florida-evacuations/">logistics are too complicated</a>, or that past warnings didn’t materialize. </p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One surprising thing</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-left">In Germany, the term “<a href="https://www.zeit.de/politik/2024-06/hochwasserschutz-ueberschwemmung-bayern-nachrichtenpodcast">Hochwasserdemenz</a>,” or <a href="https://magazin.tu-braunschweig.de/en/m-post/against-flood-dementia/">flood dementia</a>, describes how quickly even people who were directly harmed by floods go back to behaving as though the floods never happened. </p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most people exist on the opposite end of the spectrum from doomsday preppers who do things like build bunkers and <a href="https://groundfridge.com/">underground food storage</a>. The majority of us haven’t reckoned with the reality of climate disasters impacting us at all. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And all too often, despite all evidence to the contrary, people adopt a mentality that bad things won’t happen to them. Some of the riskiest regions in the country are seeing the biggest <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23872640/coastal-climate-ocean-rising-miami-florida-building">population expansions and building booms</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, bad things can<em> </em>happen to you — to all of us — as climate change expands the range of places that can flood or burn. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means a growing number of people are facing risks they have never encountered before, and that means they’ll have to develop the foresight to prepare for them. The goal is not to catastrophize and live in fear but to take meaningful steps to reduce the harm from looming threats, before, during, and after they occur. Otherwise, the fragile progress in saving lives from disasters will come undone and many of us will end up in harm’s way. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why it’s hard to remember lessons from past disasters</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The history of natural disasters shows that people extrapolate to future events and take steps to reduce their harm, at least for a little while.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricane Andrew, at the time the <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/dcmi.pdf">costliest storm</a> to ever make landfall in the US, spurred a <a href="https://baynews9.com/fl/tampa/news/2022/08/24/30-years-later--hurricane-andrew-creates-universal-building-code-for-florida">new generation of building codes</a> and regulations to make Florida homes more resilient to wind and floods. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, now the costliest storm, insurance companies <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-apr-05-na-insure5-story.html">raised their rates</a>, yet there was a big uptick in people buying flood insurance for their homes in the region and further away. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People can recognize that risks are changing too. After a big <a href="https://www.weather.gov/pah/December-10th-11th-2021-Tornado">tornado outbreak in December 2021</a>, people in the affected areas began to voice that they saw that <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24155885/tornado-season-twister-clustering">tornado patterns have changed</a> over time and their region was now more vulnerable than in the past. “I was surprised that they had put that together,” said <a href="https://kim.oucreate.com/">Kim Klockow McClain</a>, a social scientist at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research supporting the National Weather Service. “They took this event that happened to them or happened near them and communities near them and they connected it to this broader environmental change.”  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the salience of a disaster can fade away quickly. A pattern has emerged showing that after an increase in flood insurance purchases after a hurricane, many people gradually let their policies lapse due to cost or a diminishing concern as years pass between major storms. One analysis found that the bump can <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069621000826">fade away in as little as three years</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to disaster dementia, there’s also the issue of our own luck. One of the stranger phenomena is what happens to people who barely avoid getting their home knocked down, flooded, or burned. Some people who avoid disaster will take precautionary measures similar to those who were directly in the path of destruction, but <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420923001097">numerous</a> studies <a href="https://hazards.colorado.edu/news/research-counts/close-encounters-how-near-misses-influence-disaster-decision-making">have found</a> that a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/risa.12209">near-miss</a> can also create a perception that someone is less vulnerable or an extreme event is less dangerous.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a number of variables influencing these beliefs. One study shows that the more financial flexibility someone has, the more they <a href="https://socialpolicyinstitute.wustl.edu/financial-impacts-near-miss-natural-disasters/">worry about a future disaster</a> after a near-miss. In addition, if a disaster forecast or warning doesn’t pan out, that can make people <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08920759809362356">less likely to act on future alerts</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These perceptions in turn influence how much money people are willing to pay to protect themselves and how much they’ll invest to protect their communities from future devastation. Additionally, a lower perception of risk makes it less likely that someone will seek shelter or evacuate when water, wind, or flames (or all three, as in the case of recent <a href="https://www.fox26houston.com/news/beryl-death-toll-houston-fallen-trees-flooding-fire">Hurricane Beryl</a>) are barreling down. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also hard for people to respond to disasters even when they do recognize that threats are mounting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Insurance payouts often only cover restoring a property to the way it was, not to upgrade it to withstand more devastating events in the future. Changes in flood and fire risk maps can make it much harder to sell a home or buy an insurance policy, so people with few resources can end up trapped in riskier homes, even though they do want to protect themselves better or leave permanently.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this adds up to an alarming number of people who can’t act, don’t think, or don’t realize that they could suffer a blow from a major disaster.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So how do you “scare” people without scaring them?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While many natural disasters move quickly, the process of getting people to take them more seriously takes years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disaster responders and public officials need to be proactive about educating the public about the evolving and growing threats. In a place like Florida, which always has a <a href="https://www.flchamber.com/breaking-down-migration-in-and-out-of-florida/">large number of new arrivals</a> who may not be familiar with what they should do during a tropical storm, this education effort needs to be constant, explained <a href="https://ccie.ucf.edu/person/abdul-akeem-sadiq/">Abdul-Akeem Sadiq</a>, a professor of public policy at the University of Central Florida who studies disaster responses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The goal, according to Sadiq, is to create a “culture of preparedness.” That’s where everyone from individual residents to neighborhood groups, to first responders, to city officials, to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) all have rehearsed coherent plans to deal with a looming disaster. Children learn in school to head into basements when tornado sirens sound, families map out evacuation routes, utilities put additional line crews on standby to fix power outages, and so on. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Creating this culture doesn’t just hinge on how people perceive their own risks; it also depends on how much confidence they have in the people in charge. “I think the trust in the government or the authority that issues that evacuation plan is very, very critical,” Sadiq said. “If I don&#8217;t trust FEMA and them telling me ‘you need to evacuate your local community,’ I’m probably not going to heed that advice.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How authorities convey risks and alerts is critical as well. Too many false alarms can inure people to warnings and render alarms less effective when a disaster does occur. Risk assessments that use jargon or overwhelm readers with data can make it hard for ordinary people to parse their exposure to hazards. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One way to improve disaster responses is to work through local officials and institutions that already have credibility and lines of communication open in their communities. The messaging around a looming or ongoing threat also has to account for the fact that some of the most vulnerable people have the hardest time getting information and preparing accordingly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, <a href="https://www.cfpublic.org/environment/2024-05-24/multilingual-central-florida-hurricane-flood-warnings-unheard">language barriers</a> can arise for residents in risky areas. Some might not have any place to go during an evacuation and others may not be able to physically leave without assistance. Making sure all of these people are safe during the next major hurricane or wildfire requires a granular and tailored disaster response plan. “If we leave people behind, it’s a failure,” Sadiq said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With rising sea levels and more frequent, intense weather extremes, all these plans will need to be redesigned on a regular basis to account for the mounting risks. It will take some creativity to introduce people to threats they’ve never personally experienced before. One idea is to develop visualization and real-world interactives like markers on buildings that show how high storm surge can reach or monuments showing the boundaries of potential future wildfire zones. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, some increase in warming and the related extreme weather is baked in, but the destructive potential and human tolls are not. That makes it all the more urgent to take steps now — <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/356119/climate-artifical-intelligence-forecasting-tornadoes">improve forecasts</a>, expand <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23886118/climate-change-disaster-warning-hurricane-maria-dominica-caribbean">early warning systems,</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358597/climate-extreme-heat-alaska-indigenous-solutions">adapt infrastructure</a> — to reduce the harm from disasters and save lives. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But doing all this requires believing that the worst-case scenario is indeed possible and that it can be prevented.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anthropic was supposed to be the good AI company. The ethical one. The safe one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was supposed to be different from OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT. In fact, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23794855/anthropic-ai-openai-claude-2">all of Anthropic’s founders</a> once worked at OpenAI but quit in part because of differences over <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158403/openai-resignations-ai-safety-ilya-sutskever-jan-leike-artificial-intelligence">safety culture there</a>, and moved to spin up their own company that would build AI more responsibly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet lately, Anthropic has been in the headlines for less noble reasons: It’s <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/wiener-defends-ai-bill-tech-industry-criticism-19596494.php">pushing back on a landmark California bill</a> to regulate AI. It’s <a href="https://qz.com/google-alphabet-anthropic-investment-investigation-1851608599">taking money from Google and Amazon</a> in a way that’s drawing antitrust scrutiny. And it’s being accused of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/07611b74-3d69-4579-9089-f2fc2af61baa">aggressively scraping data</a> from websites without permission, harming their performance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s going on?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The best clue might come from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.07785">a 2022 paper</a> written by the Anthropic team back when their startup was just a year old. They warned that the incentives in the AI industry — think profit and prestige — will push companies to “deploy large generative models despite high uncertainty about the full extent of what these models are capable of.” They argued that, if we want safe AI, the industry’s underlying incentive structure needs to change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, at three years old, Anthropic is now the age of a toddler, and it’s experiencing many of the same growing pains that afflicted its older sibling OpenAI. In some ways, they’re the same tensions that have plagued all Silicon Valley tech startups that start out with a <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/2/16/22280502/google-dont-be-evil-land-of-the-giants-podcast">“don’t be evil”</a> philosophy. Now, though, the tensions are turbocharged. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An AI company may want to build safe systems, but in such a hype-filled industry, it faces enormous pressure to be first out of the gate. The company needs to pull in investors to supply the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/technology/anthropic-funding-ai.html">gargantuan sums of money</a> needed to build top AI models, and to do that, it needs to satisfy them by showing a path to huge profits. Oh, and the stakes —&nbsp;should the tech go wrong —&nbsp;are much higher than with almost any previous technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So a company like Anthropic has to wrestle with deep internal contradictions, and ultimately faces an existential question: Is it even possible to run an AI company that advances the state of the art while also truly prioritizing ethics and safety?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t think it’s possible,” futurist Amy Webb, the CEO of the Future Today Institute, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/21/23971765/openai-sam-altman-microsoft">told me</a> a few months ago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If even high-minded Anthropic is becoming an object lesson in that impossibility, it’s time to consider another option: The government needs to step in and change the incentive structure of the whole industry. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The incentive to keep building and deploying AI models</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anthropic has always billed itself as a safety-first company. Its leaders say they take catastrophic or existential risks from AI very seriously. CEO Dario Amodei has <a href="https://time.com/6980000/anthropic/">testified before senators</a>, making the case that AI models powerful enough to “create large-scale destruction” and upset the international balance of power could come into being as early as 2025. (Disclosure: One of Anthropic’s early investors is James McClave, whose BEMC Foundation helps <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/1/7/21020439/support-future-perfect">fund Future Perfect</a>.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So you might expect that Anthropic would be cheering <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/361562/california-ai-bill-scott-wiener-sb-1047">a bill</a> introduced by California state Sen. Scott Wiener (D-San Francisco), the Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Model Act, <a href="https://digitaldemocracy.calmatters.org/bills/ca_202320240sb1047">also known as SB 1047</a>. That legislation would require companies training the most advanced and expensive AI models to conduct safety testing and maintain the ability to pull the plug on the models if a safety incident occurs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Anthropic is lobbying to water down the bill. It wants to scrap the idea that the government should enforce safety standards before a catastrophe occurs. “Instead of deciding what measures companies should take to prevent catastrophes (which are still hypothetical and where the ecosystem is still iterating to determine best practices)” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25003075-sia-sb-1047-anthropic">the company urges</a>, “focus the bill on holding companies responsible for causing actual catastrophes.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, take no action until something has already gone terribly wrong.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some ways, Anthropic seems to be acting like any for-profit company would to protect its interests. Anthropic has not only economic incentives — to maximize profit, to offer partners like Amazon a return on investment, and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/technology/anthropic-funding-ai.html">keep raising billions</a> to build more advanced models — but also a prestige incentive to keep releasing more advanced models so it can maintain a reputation as a cutting-edge AI company. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This comes as a major disappointment to safety-focused groups, which expected Anthropic to welcome —&nbsp;not fight —&nbsp;more oversight and accountability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Anthropic is trying to gut the proposed state regulator and prevent enforcement until after a catastrophe has occurred — that’s like banning the FDA from requiring clinical trials,” Max Tegmark, president of the Future of Life Institute, told me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US has enforceable safety standards in industries ranging from pharma to aviation. Yet tech lobbyists continue to resist such regulations for their own products. Just as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/26/ai-regulation-created-google-openai-microsoft/">social media companies</a> did years ago, they make voluntary commitments to safety to placate those concerned about risks, then fight tooth and nail to stop those commitments being turned into law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In what he called “a cynical procedural move,” Tegmark noted that Anthropic has also introduced amendments to the bill that touch on the remit of every committee in the legislature, thereby giving each committee another opportunity to kill it. “This is straight out of Big Tech’s playbook,” he said</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An Anthropic spokesperson told me that the current version of the bill “could blunt America’s competitive edge in AI development” and that the company wants to “refocus the bill on frontier AI safety and away from approaches that aren’t adaptable enough for a rapidly evolving technology.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The incentive to gobble up everyone’s data&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s another tension at the heart of AI development: Companies need to hoover up reams and reams of high-quality text from books and websites in order to train their systems. But that text is created by human beings, and human beings generally do not like having their work used without their consent. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All major AI companies scrape publicly available data to use in training, a practice they argue is legally protected under fair use. But scraping is controversial, and it’s being challenged in court. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/20/books/authors-openai-lawsuit-chatgpt-copyright.html">Famous authors</a> like Jonathan Franzen and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/28/technology/openai-copyright-suit-media.html">media companies</a> like the New York Times have sued OpenAI for copyright infringement, saying that the AI company lifted their writing without permission. This is the kind of legal battle that could end up remaking copyright law, with ramifications for all AI companies. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that has signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/352849/openai-chatgpt-google-meta-artificial-intelligence-vox-media-chatbots">remains editorially independent</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, data scraping violates some websites’ terms of service. YouTube <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199636/apple-anthropic-nvidia-salesforce-youtube-videos-training-data-copyright">says</a> that training an AI model using the platform’s videos or transcripts is a violation of the site’s terms. Yet that’s exactly what Anthropic has done, according to a <a href="https://www.proofnews.org/apple-nvidia-anthropic-used-thousands-of-swiped-youtube-videos-to-train-ai/">recent investigation</a> by Proof News.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Web publishers and content creators are angry. Matt Barrie, chief executive of Freelancer.com, a platform that connects freelancers with clients, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/07611b74-3d69-4579-9089-f2fc2af61baa">said</a> Anthropic is “the most aggressive scraper by far,” swarming the site even after being told to stop. “We had to block them because they don’t obey the rules of the internet. This is egregious scraping [that] makes the site slower for everyone operating on it and ultimately affects our revenue.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dave Farina, the host of the popular YouTube science show <em>Professor Dave Explains</em>, <a href="https://www.proofnews.org/apple-nvidia-anthropic-used-thousands-of-swiped-youtube-videos-to-train-ai/">told</a> Proof News that “the sheer principle of it” is what upsets him. Some 140 of his videos were lifted as part of the dataset that Anthropic used for training. “If you’re profiting off of work that I’ve done [to build a product] that will put me out of work, or people like me out of work, then there needs to be a conversation on the table about compensation or some kind of regulation,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why would Anthropic take the risk of using lifted data from, say, YouTube, when the platform has explicitly forbidden it and copyright infringement is such a hot topic right now?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because AI companies need ever-more high-quality data to continue boosting their models’ performance. Using synthetic data, which is created by algorithms, doesn’t look promising. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y">Research</a> shows that <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23674696/chatgpt-ai-creativity-originality-homogenization">letting ChatGPT eat its own tail</a> leads to bizarre, unusable output. (One writer coined <a href="https://x.com/jathansadowski/status/1625245803211272194">a term for it</a>: “Hapsburg AI,” after the European royal house that famously devolved over generations of inbreeding.) What’s needed is fresh data created by actual humans, but it’s becoming harder and harder to harvest that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Publishers are blocking web crawlers, putting up paywalls, or updating their terms of service to bar AI companies from using their data as training fodder. A <a href="https://www.dataprovenance.org/consent-in-crisis-paper">new study</a> from the MIT-affiliated Data Provenance Initiative looked at three of the major datasets — each containing millions of books, articles, videos, and other scraped web data — that are used for training AI. It turns out, 25 percent of the highest-quality data in these datasets is now restricted. The authors call it “an emerging crisis of consent.” Some, like OpenAI, have begun to respond to this in part by striking licensing deals with media outlets, <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/352849/openai-chatgpt-google-meta-artificial-intelligence-vox-media-chatbots">including Vox</a>. But that may only get them so far, given how much remains officially off-limits. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AI companies could theoretically accept the limits to advancement that come with restricting their training data to what can be ethically sourced, but then they wouldn’t stay competitive. So companies like Anthropic are incentivized to go to more extreme lengths to get the data they need, even if that means taking dubious action.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anthropic acknowledges that it trained its chatbot, Claude, using the Pile, a dataset that includes subtitles from 173,536 YouTube videos. When I asked how it justifies this use, an Anthropic spokesperson told me, “With regard to the dataset at issue in The Pile, we did not crawl YouTube to create that dataset nor did we create that dataset at all.” (That echoes what Anthropic has previously <a href="https://www.proofnews.org/apple-nvidia-anthropic-used-thousands-of-swiped-youtube-videos-to-train-ai/">told</a> Proof News: “[W]e’d have to refer you to The Pile authors.”) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The implication is that because Anthropic didn’t make the dataset, it’s fine for them to use it. But it seems unfair to shift all the responsibility onto the Pile authors — a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/ai/one-of-the-worlds-largest-ai-training-datasets-is-about-to-get-bigger-and-substantially-better/">nonprofit group</a> that aimed to create an open source dataset researchers could study — if Anthropic used YouTube’s data in a manner that violates the platform’s terms.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Companies should probably do their own due diligence. They’re using this for commercial purposes,” said Shayne Longpre, lead author on the Data Provenance Initiative study. He contrasted that with the Pile’s creators and the many academics who have used the dataset to conduct research. “Academic purposes are clearly distinct from commercial purposes and are likely to have different norms.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The incentive to rake in as much cash as possible&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To build a cutting-edge AI model these days, you need a ton of computing power — and that’s incredibly expensive. To gather the hundreds of millions of dollars needed, AI companies have to partner with tech giants.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why OpenAI, initially founded as a nonprofit, had to create a for-profit arm and partner with Microsoft. And it’s why Anthropic ended up taking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/technology/anthropic-funding-ai.html">multibillion-dollar investments</a> from Amazon and Google.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Deals like these always come with risks. The tech giants want to see a quick return on their investments and maximize profit. To keep them happy, the AI companies may feel pressure to deploy an advanced AI model even if they’re not sure it’s safe. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The partnerships also raise the specter of monopolies — the concentration of economic power. Anthropic’s investments from Google and Amazon led to a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/25/technology/ftc-ai-microsoft-amazon-google.html">probe by the Federal Trade Commission</a> and are now <a href="https://qz.com/google-alphabet-anthropic-investment-investigation-1851608599">drawing antitrust scrutiny</a> in the UK, where a consumer regulatory agency is investigating whether there’s been a “relevant merger situation” that could result in a “substantial lessening of competition.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An Anthropic spokesperson said the company intends to cooperate with the agency and give them a full picture of the investments. “We are an independent company and none of our strategic partnerships or investor relationships diminish the independence of our corporate governance or our freedom to partner with others,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recent experience, though, suggests that AI companies’ unique governance structures may not be enough to prevent the worst.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic has never given either Google or Amazon a seat on its board or any observation rights over it. But, very much like OpenAI, Anthropic is relying on an unusual corporate governance structure of its own design. OpenAI initially created a board whose idealistic mission was to safeguard humanity’s best interests, not please stockholders. Anthropic has created an experimental governance structure, the Long-Term Benefit Trust, a group of people without financial interest in the company who will ultimately have majority control over it, as they’ll be empowered to elect and remove three of its five corporate directors. (This authority will phase in as the company hits certain milestones.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are limits to the idealism of the Trust: It must “ensure that Anthropic responsibly balances the financial interests of stockholders with the interests of those affected by Anthropic’s conduct and our public benefit purpose.” Plus, <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/the-long-term-benefit-trust">Anthropic says</a>, “we have also designed a series of ‘failsafe’ provisions that allow changes to the Trust and its powers without the consent of the Trustees if sufficiently large supermajorities of the stockholders agree.”   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And if we learned anything from last year’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/21/23971765/openai-sam-altman-microsoft">OpenAI boardroom coup</a>, it’s that governance structures can and do change. When the OpenAI board tried to safeguard humanity by ousting CEO Sam Altman, it faced fierce pushback. In a matter of days, Altman clawed his way back into his old role, the board members who’d fired him were out, and the makeup of the board changed in Altman’s favor. What’s more, OpenAI gave Microsoft an observer seat on the board, which allowed it to access confidential information and perhaps apply pressure at board meetings. Only when that raised (you guessed it) antitrust scrutiny did Microsoft <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-ditches-openai-board-observer-seat-amid-regulatory-scrutiny-2024-07-10/">give up the seat</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think it showed that the board does not have the teeth one might have hoped it had,” Carroll Wainwright, who quit OpenAI this year, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353933/openai-open-letter-safety-whistleblowers-right-to-warn">told me</a>. “It made me question how well the board can hold the organization accountable.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why he and several others published a proposal demanding that AI companies grant them “a right to warn about advanced artificial intelligence.” <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353933/openai-open-letter-safety-whistleblowers-right-to-warn">Per the proposal</a>: “AI companies have strong financial incentives to avoid effective oversight, and we do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It sounds a lot like what another figure in AI <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23794855/anthropic-ai-openai-claude-2">told</a> Vox last year: “I am pretty skeptical of things that relate to corporate governance because I think the incentives of corporations are horrendously warped, including ours.” Those are the words of Jack Clark, the policy chief at Anthropic. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If AI companies won’t fix it, who will?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Anthropic team had it right originally, back when they published that paper in 2022: The pressures of the market are just too brutal. Private AI companies do not have the motivation to change that, so the government needs to change the underlying incentive structure within which all these companies operate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked Webb, the futurist, what a better AI business ecosystem could look like, she said it would include a mix of carrots and sticks: positive incentives, like tax breaks for companies that prove they’re upholding the highest safety standards; and negative incentives, like regulation that would fine companies if they deploy <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22916602/ai-bias-fairness-tradeoffs-artificial-intelligence">biased algorithms</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With AI regulation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/technology/california-ai-regulation.html">at a standstill at the federal level</a> —&nbsp;plus a looming election —&nbsp;it’s falling to states to pass new laws. The California bill, if it passes, would be one piece of that puzzle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Civil society also has a role to play. If publishers and content creators are not happy about having their work used as training fodder, they can fight back. If tech workers are worried about what they see at AI companies, they can blow the whistle. AI can generate a whole lot on our behalf, but resistance to its own problematic deployment is something we have to generate ourselves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Threat!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a flash, 50 people pull replica handguns and raise them above shoulder height, careful not to point the mock weapons at the heads of those sitting in front of them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a Saturday morning on the South Side of Chicago, and the heat is rising in the classroom as firearms instructor Mike Brown leads students through gun-handling drills. They hold the model guns aloft until he yells, “Chest!,” which is their cue to draw the weapons back to their bodies. He drills them over and over, so pointing the gun feels like pure instinct, a reflex each time they hear him shout, “Threat!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few hours earlier, just before 8 am, the students began lining up with coffee cups and water bottles outside of Brown’s storefront office, where they’ve committed to spending 16 hours of their weekend learning about gun safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a diverse group: Over half are women and the majority are Black, but there are white and Hispanic students, too. Some are as young as 18, and a handful are older, but most of them are 20- and 30-somethings. Several are new to firearms or are planning to get their first gun soon. Everyone is there for a common reason: to complete Illinois’s required training to get a concealed carry license, which will allow them to bring their guns in public.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/AMERICAN_GUN_OWNERSHIP-45.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=5.5453125,18.944576630413,94.4546875,65.983693074043" alt="A black man in a blue ball cap and tactical gear checks the ID of a Black woman in a pink ball cap and jeans jacket." title="A black man in a blue ball cap and tactical gear checks the ID of a Black woman in a pink ball cap and jeans jacket." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Mike Brown, left, welcomes his concealed carry class at the Eagle Sports Range in Oak Forest, just outside Chicago, in April. As first-time gun ownership exploded in Illinois during the pandemic — as it did across the country — Brown saw his classes fill each week with students new to firearms. " data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Brown teaches these classes most weekends. For the past few years, he says, they’ve been packed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s partly because Brown, a charismatic 43-year-old <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yesmikesaidit">with a large social media following</a>, offers something different from the dry legalese you might expect from a firearms safety course. His class is more like standup comedy meets group therapy meets self-defense seminar, taught by a drill sergeant.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s another reason why Brown’s classes are full, week after week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The beginning of the 2020s marked a significant shift in America’s relationship with guns and gun violence. The Covid-19 lockdowns, combined with nationwide protests and a police reckoning following the killing of George Floyd, worsened an ongoing&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/508169/historically-low-faith-institutions-continues.aspx">breakdown of trust</a> in institutions and society.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, violent crime increased across the United States, with the homicide rate rising faster than at any time <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/06/health/us-homicide-rate-increase-nchs-study/index.html">in more than 100 years</a>. Guns became the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23662072/children-guns-mass-shootings-kansas-city">leading cause of death for children and teens</a>, rising 50 percent over two years. In 2021, a year that began with more political unrest and a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22217576/trump-insurrection-capitol-america-political-violence">violent insurrection</a>, more <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/26/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/">Americans died of gun-related injuries than in any year on record</a>. The rise in gun deaths was a major factor in Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s decision this summer to declare gun violence a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/health/gun-violence-surgeon-general.html">public health crisis</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid the violence, millions of Americans made a potentially life-altering decision: They decided it was time to buy their first gun.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.norc.org/research/library/one-in-five-american-households-purchased-a-gun-during-the-pande.html">One in 20 American adults bought a gun for the first time</a> between March 2020 and March 2022, according to survey data from independent research organization NORC at the University of Chicago.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How I reported this story</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After reading the available research about the spike in Americans purchasing their first gun during the pandemic, I was fascinated. Having so many new gun owners — not to mention the millions of guns acquired by existing gun owners — would certainly have a major impact on society, one that would only compound with the Supreme Court ruling affirming a constitutional right to carry guns in public. I wanted to find out where the new gun owners were from and what was driving their choice.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Knowing that would help answer how guns became normalized in American homes in such a brief period. It might also reveal what all these new guns would mean for everyday life. I spent weeks emailing researchers about different ways I might find that answer, but I soon realized there wasn’t good data about their locations. I needed to reframe my question. I looked at the FBI’s background check system and noted a huge jump in background checks in Illinois from 2019–2021. Illinois is one of only a few states that requires a special license<strong> </strong>to own a gun. I reached out to the Illinois State Police to see how many people applied in 2020 and saw that they also experienced a surge of new applications. I began reaching out to people in Chicago, and a few weeks later, I was attending Mike Brown’s concealed carry class and meeting new gun owners to hear their experiences.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Previously, American gun sales were driven by a small number of people: overwhelmingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/4/9849524/gun-race-statistics">white men</a> adding to their existing gun collections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The people who bought their first guns during the pandemic were different.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">NORC’s study found that 69 percent were people of color. According to a separate <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M21-3423">study</a> by researchers at Northeastern and Harvard Universities, 20 percent of new gun buyers between 2019 and 2021 were Black and 20 percent were Hispanic. Half were women — a massive shift given that, between 1980–2014, only <a href="https://www.norc.org/content/dam/norc-org/pdfs/GSS_Trends%20in%20Gun%20Ownership_US_1972-2014.pdf">9 to 14 percent of women</a> owned guns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Listen to the students in Brown’s class and to others who became gun owners during this period and a clear picture emerges of what drove so many people to get their first gun. As crime soared and trust in the police faltered, a grim kind of logic took hold: If everyone else is going to have a gun, then I need to have one, too<em>.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Everybody’s got guns, so it’s only right to have one,” says Leslie Bullard Jr., 31. “I’ve got to make sure my family and my kids are safe.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like so many Americans, Brown’s students watched guns proliferate in their community and country in real time. Brown is clear-eyed about why they come to him for training.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They don’t want to die,” he says. “They’re scared of the violence.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That fear — and the decisions Americans made because of it — speaks to an important new reality around the nation’s relationship with guns: Prior to the pandemic, the US already had more privately owned firearms than civilians in <a href="https://www.smallarmssurvey.org/sites/default/files/resources/SAS-Press-release-global-firearms-holdings.pdf">the other top 25 gun-owning countries combined</a>. It was hard to imagine that the country’s internal arms race could escalate any further.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it has.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Millions more guns, both legal and not, flooded into the country during the pandemic.&nbsp;Recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/14/us/politics/supreme-court-trump-gun-bump-stocks.html">Supreme Court</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/23/23180205/supreme-court-new-york-rifle-pistol-clarence-thomas-second-amendment-guns">decisions</a> made meaningful regulation all but impossible.&nbsp;No one is completely immune from the risks of this new era of gun violence, not even <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361133/trump-assassination-attempt-rnc-men-guns" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/politics/361133/trump-assassination-attempt-rnc-men-guns">the former president</a> of the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And though homicide and violent crime have dropped from their pandemic spike, guns are not like iPhones. They don’t outlive their purpose after a few years, and <a href="https://story.californiasunday.com/escape-unwanted-firearms/">they’re extremely difficult to get rid of safely</a>. They can be deadly for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rise in the number of new gun-owning households “really changes all kinds of policy and political calculations,” says John Roman, author of the NORC survey. Beyond the safety risks of owning a gun are the deeper implications for society: for <a href="https://www.nyulawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/98-NYU-L-Rev-1831.pdf">policing</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/stolen-guns-cars-crime-fbi-data-66316ff1933dad8df984803fca377775">crime</a>, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/05/09/health/gun-violence-pandemic-strains-hospitals/index.html">medical services</a>, and <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/center-for-gun-violence-solutions/research-reports/the-public-health-approach-to-prevent-gun-violence">public health</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re definitely not in the same place we were in 2019,” says Roman.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are living through an inflection point in America’s long love affair with guns.<strong> </strong>“People were given the message that they were on their own. The government was not functional,” says Patrick Sharkey, a sociology professor at Princeton University who studies urban inequality, public policy, and violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That feeling when institutions break down, I think, played a role in contributing to the major surge of gun sales and the rise in violence. When you feel like no one is in charge, that&#8217;s a recipe for violence to emerge.”&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">By different measures, other cities might be thought of as the nation’s old gun heartland: Billings, Montana, a predominantly white city in the state with the <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/tools/TL300/TL354/RAND_TL354.pdf">highest average rate of household firearm ownership</a>; or Houston, Texas, a large southern city in the state with the <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/07/28/texas-gun-stats/">highest estimated number of gun sales</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as the greater Chicago area — home to more than half of Illinois’s population — faced increasing violence during the pandemic, it became emblematic<strong> </strong>of the changing realities around American gun ownership. Rising interest in guns took place in a racially diverse city, long known as a Democratic stronghold, in a state with some of the toughest gun laws in the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other Democratic cities saw similar increases in gun permits and concealed carry applications. In New York, applications to the NYPD to own a handgun doubled, from 2,892 in 2019 to 5,820 in 2020, according to reporting <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/more-new-yorkers-are-applying-for-gun-permits-the-nypd-wont-say-how-many-they-granted">by Gothamist</a>, a nonprofit news organization.&nbsp;Pennsylvania does not require a permit to purchase a gun, but applications to carry a firearm exploded in 2021: State police that year issued 384,522 permits to carry, a 24 percent increase over the year before, with the increase coming almost entirely from Philadelphia, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/guns-pennsylvania-owners-licenses-permits-20220529.html">according to an analysis by the Philadelphia Inquirer</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="Gun sales in the US surged during the pandemic" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/33YIs/5/" frameborder="0" height="558"></iframe>!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those trend lines in cities powered the nationwide surge in gun sales, but it’s difficult to determine where exactly the estimated 17 million people newly exposed to firearms in their homes live. Neither the NORC study nor the Northeastern study published data on their locations, and there’s no federal registry of gun owners that can offer insight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check system, though, suggests a sharp increase in gun purchases in Illinois during the pandemic: The number of background checks performed in the state spiked from 4.9 million in 2019 to 7.4 million in 2020 and 8.4 million in 2021. Illinois performed more background checks during those years than any other state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other signs also point to the Midwest’s largest city as a hotspot for new gun owners.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/AMERICAN_GUN_OWNERSHIP-08.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Two women pose in a large vacant lot backed by low-income housing." title="Two women pose in a large vacant lot backed by low-income housing." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Kendra Adams and Keyla Fields were students of firearms instructor Mike Brown’s this spring and part of a wave of Americans who became interested in guns in recent years.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Illinois is one of only <a href="https://giffords.org/lawcenter/gun-laws/policy-areas/owner-responsibilities/licensing/">three states</a> that requires a license to own a firearm. The number of new applications the state received for a license to legally own a firearm rose to historic highs in 2020, according to <a href="https://isp.illinois.gov/Foid/Statistics">data</a> provided by the Illinois State Police.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Applications for the state’s Firearm Owner’s Identification, also known as FOID cards, rose 56 percent between 2019 and 2020, resulting in <a href="https://www.nprillinois.org/statehouse/2020-12-09/republicans-pritzker-administration-point-fingers-as-foid-card-backlog-exacerbated-in-2020">a significant backlog in the approval process</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Brown bought a gun for protection in 2020, amid a nationwide spike in violence that has since declined." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The number of applications climbed as the city and the country experienced a precipitous rise in violent crime. Murders rose across the US in 2020, but in Chicago, the violence was especially acute: The number of killings in the city that year <a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/chicago-crime-spikes-in-2022-but-first-drop-in-murder-since-pandemic/#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20year%20of,in%20the%20past%20quarter%2Dcentury.">jumped 55 percent, compared to 30 percent nationally</a>. In 2021, the city saw more homicides than any other metropolis in the United States. And though other cities had higher murder rates, it was <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/2021-ends-as-chicagos-deadliest-year-in-a-quarter-century/2719307/">the deadliest year</a> for Chicagoans since 1996, with more than 3,500 shooting incidents.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The danger wasn’t spread equally across the city: The worst gun violence was<strong> </strong>concentrated in <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2022/1/3/22858995/chicago-violence-dangerous-murders-per-capita-2021-2020-surge-garfield-park-police-lori-lightfoot">economically segregated neighborhoods</a> that were predominantly Black or Latino and already struggled with high levels of crime, perpetuating what Sharkey calls the “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/crime-wave-gun-violence-chicago-causes/672216/">rigid geography of violence</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lingering effects of that violence can be felt in Brown's classroom.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Any Chicagoan is probably suffering from PTSD,” says Cynthia, one of the attendees in Brown’s class.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cynthia is a retired parole officer, there to renew her concealed carry license. (Vox has agreed to withhold her last name for safety reasons.) “You worry about going out,” she says. “If you have to put gas in the car — and it doesn't matter what time of day, it doesn't matter if it’s 7 o’clock in the morning or 5 o’clock in the morning — we have to keep our heads on a swivel. Why do we have to live like this?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Interest in getting a gun in her state spiked after periods of unrest: According to an investigation by the local CBS News station, on June 2, 2020, <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/2021/06/02/chicagos-2020-unrest-a-tribune-investigation-documents-the-scope-of-the-damage-and-its-lingering-impact-on-neighborhoods-businesses/">following days of rioting and looting</a> in Chicago, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/foid-card-application-backlog-illinois-violence-looting/">4,916 people applied for a license to own a gun on a single day</a> — more than had applied in the previous eight days combined. Today, Cook County, home to Chicago and its suburbs, has <a href="https://isp.illinois.gov/Foid/Statistics">more FOID card holders than any other county</a> in the state.</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homicides in the city and across the United States have since dropped, but some forms of violent crime, including robberies, <a href="https://crimelab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/04/UChicago-Crime-Lab-2023-End-of-Year-Crime-Trends.pdf">continued to rise in Chicago last year</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For those who spend a lot of time traveling throughout the city and suburbs, the risks feel especially pronounced.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Frank Brown, a student in the class (who bears no relation to Mike Brown), first purchased a gun in 2020 but decided to get a concealed carry license this year to protect himself while working as a ride-hail and delivery driver. “With the increasing amount of violence that’s been happening to those drivers nowadays, it caused me to have a bit more concern for my personal safety,” he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mike Brown’s class is calibrated to his students’ experiences of living in Chicago these last few years. Many of his students are there because they live in communities deeply affected by the violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Everybody is talking, but ain’t nobody hearing the kids. But guess what?” Brown asks them. “When they shoot your ass out there, you hear them now. And that’s why your ass is in here.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the number of guns grows, Brown is of two minds about what it all means. He believes in the rights of law-abiding gun owners to carry weapons, especially given the number of people carrying them illegally. And his students are trying to do things the right way. But owning a gun doesn’t mean much and can be really dangerous if the carriers aren’t trained in how to use them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even with state-mandated training, he thinks a lot of people aren’t fully prepared for the responsibilities of owning a firearm.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/AMERICAN_GUN_OWNERSHIP-48.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.071730295544,100,69.856539408912" alt="A man wearing a vest that reads &quot;Firearm instructor&quot; looks on while a student fires at a target in a gun range." title="A man wearing a vest that reads &quot;Firearm instructor&quot; looks on while a student fires at a target in a gun range." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Mike Brown talks with a student during the target practice component of his class. Even as he teaches gun safety, Brown is ambivalent about the rise in the number of guns nationally. He encourages his students to seek more training before carrying their guns in public." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“What I see here is a powder keg, a lot of frustration, a lot of anger, a lot of bad relationships,” Brown says. “And all those factors can motivate people to come into my class and get what they think is going to be the fixer of their problems.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Brown speaks about the forces that drive gun violence, he echoes what the experts say. “People pick up guns to solve a problem,” turning mundane conflicts into lethal ones, says Alex Piquero, a sociology and criminology professor at the University of Miami and former director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Brown wants his students to understand that carrying a gun is not going to solve their problems. It could just make those problems worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Pressing the trigger is easy,” he says. “The hard part is going to be the aftermath of all the other things you didn’t factor for: the police investigation, then whoever you shot, somebody loves that person, so now they’re coming for you, and you still got to live here.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He bookends his lessons with this message.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Everybody’s a gangbanger until it’s time to actually gangbang,” he tells his students&nbsp;as he stands in front of a framed target with the center shot out. “There’s people out there waiting for you to fuck around and find out.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/AMERICAN_GUN_OWNERSHIP-50.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A Black man with long braids stands by a flowering tree with low-income housing in the background." title="A Black man with long braids stands by a flowering tree with low-income housing in the background." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Leslie Bullard Jr. poses for a portrait during class at the Eagle Sports Range." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Should everyone have a gun?” he asks them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No!” they call out in response.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, the 50 people in the room — and thousands of others who’ve gone through Brown’s classes — have decided that they should.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like their teacher, Brown’s students are not card-carrying NRA members who treat gun ownership as an identitarian issue. They’re different, and it’s obvious after spending a minute in the class.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of them are women. They speak rarely about politics and hardly at all about their Second Amendment rights. Instead, they describe a sense of fear for their children in a society awash with guns. When they speak about gun ownership, they speak primarily about safety and responsibility. They are driven by a desire to exert some control in what feels like a chaotic and uncertain time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I have two boys at home, and I’m a single mom, so getting concealed carry was important to me because it’s just me,” says Zakiya Robinson, 32.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s Saturday afternoon, on the first day of the concealed carry class. After a lunch break, Brown’s students reconvene at Eagle Sports Range, at the southern end of Cook County. Brown, wearing a bulletproof safety vest with a patch that reads “Black Guns Matter,” is joined by another instructor to lead students through setting up their targets and preparing to shoot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inside the range, bullet casings bounce off the walls and floors; paper practice targets flutter as students draw them in on automated pulleys to see where their bullets hit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Robinson says she is worried about how to keep her family safe. She feels tremendous pressure figuring out how to raise her son in a dangerous world while balancing his need to be a child. “I can’t express that to my son enough, and it’s hard because they’re in kid mode. They don’t know that the world is crappy. They don’t know that they have to be aware of their surroundings. He just wants to go to the park and play. It’s a hard thing.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/Longoria_Crop_AMERICAN_GUN_OWNERSHIP-26_VanessaLongoria-copy.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.366492146597,100,39.267015706806" alt="A white woman crouches next to a toddler in a tutu who is drinking from the straw of a water bottle." title="A white woman crouches next to a toddler in a tutu who is drinking from the straw of a water bottle." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Vanessa Longoria became a concealed carry instructor in 2020, when her own gun teacher told her women were interested in learning from someone like themselves." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Her concerns are shared by other mothers in the city, including those at a gathering the night before organized by Vanessa Longoria, a concealed carry instructor, in Humboldt Park, a neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. Three weeks before, the <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/autopsy-reveals-dexter-reed-was-shot-13-times-in-deadly-gunfight-with-chicago-police/3420927/">police killed 26-year-old Dexter Reed</a> in the same neighborhood during a traffic stop, in a case that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/dexter-reed-shooting-protest/">sparked local protests</a> <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/24/us/dexter-reed-chicago-police-shooting/index.html">and captured national attention</a>. And just three days earlier, Longoria pointed out, <a href="https://www.fox32chicago.com/news/humboldt-park-shooting-4-year-old-boy">a 4-year-old child had been shot</a> while traveling in a car several blocks away. Hearing about those shootings has spurred their protective instincts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Longoria, 35, decided to become a firearms instructor in 2020, when her gun teacher told her there were plenty of women who wanted to learn to shoot but would prefer to be taught by someone like them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She finds that other women relate to her reason for weapons training. “I want to protect myself but also my family,” she says. The women she’s worked with want to feel that, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Generational shifts have almost certainly played a role in their relationships to guns. In 1990, according to the Urban Institute, women were the heads of household — or the main breadwinner — in about a third of US households. By 2019, women were the heads of household <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/more-women-have-become-homeowners-and-heads-household-could-pandemic-undo-progress">in half of American homes</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These women were used to doing it all, including taking on the traditionally male roles of providing and protection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I got divorced, so then it was just me and my daughter by ourselves. There’s no man in the house anymore,” says Lynda Gilly, 46, who got a gun in 2020. “So now I have to just keep it there in case of anything. Thank God nothing’s ever happened to where I’ve had to pull it out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Black homes, the share of families with women as heads of household is even higher, at <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/more-women-have-become-homeowners-and-heads-household-could-pandemic-undo-progress">60 percent</a>. The concerns about safety are compounded by the knowledge that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/data-download/alarming-rise-youth-gun-deaths-breaks-differently-race-rcna79916">the rate of gun deaths among Black children in the US is more than five times higher</a> than for other children, and the danger can come both from the community and <a href="https://eu.jacksonville.com/story/news/crime/2017/01/13/scathing-report-says-chicago-police-violated-civil-rights-for-years/10273674007/">also from the police</a>. Sixty-one percent of victims of gun homicide in 2020 were Black, with the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2818887?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;utm_term=052224">largest increases</a> in deaths among Black boys and men ages 10–44.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For that reason, LaSinda Thompson, 32, and her husband have decided they would rather their children learn about guns from them. “When they both turn 8, we will be teaching them about gun safety and taking them to the range,” she says.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/AMERICAN_GUN_OWNERSHIP-28LasindaThompson_287536.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.071730295544,100,69.856539408912" alt="A black woman in glasses sits on a radiator in a community meeting space." title="A black woman in glasses sits on a radiator in a community meeting space." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="LaSinda Thompson pictured at a gathering organized by Longoria. Thompson and her husband have decided to teach their children about gun safety when they turn 8." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“With me having a child, it’s like, I can’t imagine letting him just be out by himself,” says Sade Adejumo, 33, who grew up with Longoria. “It just makes you feel fearful because my one job in this world is to protect this child and make sure nothing happens to this child.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem, experts say, is that having a gun in the home can be extremely dangerous, substantially increasing relative risk. While most people safely and responsibly own firearms, those who have guns in their homes are more than twice as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/07/guns-handguns-safety-homicide-killing-study">likely</a> to be shot and killed than people who don’t.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s conclusive that buying a gun doesn’t make you safer,” says Roman, an expert on firearms data. “If you’re a <a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2022/04/handguns-homicide-risk.html">woman in a household with a gun</a>, your chance of being the victim of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10209983/">a firearm homicide goes way up</a>. If you’re a teenage or 20-something boy or man, your chance of <a href="https://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/27/3/264">committing suicide goes up</a> fourfold. We underestimate the cost of gun ownership, in terms of risk of somebody in our household being seriously injured or killed by that gun.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Matthew Miller, an epidemiologist who studies the links between gun access and violent injury and death, and who authored the Northeastern study, puts it more starkly. “The people who are now exposed to guns in their home for the first time, they are several-fold more likely to die a violent death” by suicide or other gun-related injuries, he says. Guns increase risk because easy access to a firearm makes violent impulses especially lethal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gilly, whose daughter is now in college, says she’s aware of the risk of her gun being used against her or her family. “It’s not like my gun’s out in the open,” she says. But, she says, “If I’m pulling it out — oh my God, I better be able to defend myself.”&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">For policymakers already concerned about the dangers guns pose, their proliferation is a troubling development.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We haven’t helped people feel safe enough. We need to step up and do more to help people feel like they don't need a gun,” says Rep. Robin Kelly, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side and suburbs. “I can’t tell people how to feel, especially when they see things on the news.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m disappointed that people have more guns, and that it’s spreading to different populations,” she says. “But I’m not surprised.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A number of factors make it difficult for those who, <a href="https://robinkelly.house.gov/issues/gun-violence">like Kelly, are working</a> to reduce gun violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Illinois is <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/04/12/us/kentucky-gun-laws/index.html">surrounded by states</a>, including Kentucky, Indiana, and Missouri, with <a href="https://www.everytown.org/state/missouri/">some of the nation’s least restrictive</a> <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/rankings/state/indiana/">gun laws</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm">worst firearms mortality rates</a>, making regulation more difficult to enforce.&nbsp;<br>Following a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/highland-park-parade-mass-shooting-suspect-indicted-117-charges-illino-rcna40332">mass shooting in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park</a> in 2022 that killed seven people and injured 48 others, the state passed the first <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/us/illinois-gun-ban-second-amendment.html">assault weapons ban</a> in the Midwest.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex"><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/AMERICAN_GUN_OWNERSHIP-13.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Emmanuel Katsabis poses for a portrait during Mike Brown’s class at  Eagle Sports Range.&lt;br&gt; " data-portal-copyright="" />

" data-portal-copyright="" /></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A 2022 US Supreme Court decision,<em> New York State Rifle &amp; Pistol Association v. Bruen,</em> upheld the right of Americans to carry guns in public and placed the burden on the government to prove that their regulations were consistent with historical gun laws. As a result, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/6/23/23180205/supreme-court-new-york-rifle-pistol-clarence-thomas-second-amendment-guns">almost all restrictions on guns became vulnerable to legal challenges</a>. Illinois’s law banning assault weapons was immediately contested by gun rights groups. In July, the Court <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-illinois-assault-weapons-ban-right-to-bear-arms-rcna153971">declined to take up the challenge</a>, leaving the Illinois law in place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s recent decisions didn’t happen in a vacuum. Before Bruen, several states had passed laws <a href="https://www.thetrace.org/2023/04/permitless-concealed-carry-gun-law-map/">making it easier for people to carry guns in public</a>. At the same time, gun manufacturers <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-gun-production-nearly-tripled-ghost-guns-boom-federal-data-2022-5">increased production of weapons</a>, and methods for <a href="https://fas.org/publication/the-ghost-guns-haunting-national-crime-statistics/">illegally obtaining a gun</a> became easier. Those factors, experts say, almost certainly contributed to an increase in demand from people looking to get weapons for protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The explosion in new guns has created other concerns about public safety, Roman says. The fact that more people have guns and that they’re increasingly carrying them in their cars and on their persons, as well as at home, creates more opportunities for guns to be stolen.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That means that the homeowner’s gun has a higher chance of becoming a crime gun,” Roman says. “We see that in the data: The time from purchase to a gun showing up at a crime scene has fallen. Newer guns are ending up as street guns <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/crime-courts/first-sweeping-federal-gun-crime-report-20-years-shows-firearms-bought-rcna68771">quicker than they did in 2019</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A recent investigation of FBI crime data from Everytown, an organization that supports stronger gun safety regulations, also found that the <a href="https://everytownresearch.org/report/gun-thefts-from-cars-the-largest-source-of-stolen-guns-2/">rate of guns stolen</a> from vehicles has tripled in the last decade, with an average of one gun stolen from a car every nine minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Complicating matters further, the millions of guns the government estimates were sold legally almost certainly undercount the total number of weapons that flooded the US during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The number of ghost guns — homemade guns that aren’t traceable because they don’t use serial numbers the way gun manufacturers do — that were recovered from crime scenes increased <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/02/10/1153977949/major-takeaways-from-the-atf-gun-violence-report">1,083 percent between 2017 and 2021</a>, according to <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/docs/report/nfcta-volume-ii-part-iii-crime-guns-recovered-and-traced-us/download">an analysis</a> by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What we’re seeing in the official records about purchases is one thing. To me, that number is the floor. There are more above that,” Piquero says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How many more? We don't know.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While many of the new gun owners are obtaining their guns legally, experts worry that the spread of even more firearms will make the nation more deeply entrenched in the problems that come with a highly fractious society with too many guns. These factors, Roman says, make efforts to reduce <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/29/1184731316/gun-violence-epidemic-suicide-mass-shooting-public-health-emergency-chicago">America’s gun violence epidemic</a> exceedingly difficult.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the American arms race continues.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“With this many guns in civilian hands, it’s unlikely that we are going to be able to do much better than we are today” on gun violence, Roman says. “Firearms make fist fights into gun fights, and there’s always going to be some fist fights.”&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">This last part is what concerns Brown.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the second day of his class, he leads the students through different hypothetical&nbsp;encounters, each involving the threat of violence. After giving a short description of the situation, he asks the students a question:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In this instance, do you <em>have </em>to shoot, or do you <em>want </em>to shoot?”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The students debate different possibilities, many of them ripped from local headlines and social media: One is based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5q04xyi42g">a recent case in New York City</a>, where a neighborly dispute over apartment noise escalated into a double homicide caught on camera. Another is about the murder of 24-year-old <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/chicago-police-officer-areanah-preston-remembered-year-later/">Aréanah Preston</a>, a Chicago police officer, during an armed robbery attempt outside her home. Each scenario sparks intense discussion and disagreement about the best course of action.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a reason Brown walks students through these scenarios. “I don’t consider myself to be a die-hard Second Amendment community member,” who believes that guns are a solution to every problem, he says. Instead, he considers himself a “part of the intellectual branch of the conflict-avoidant group, who happens to carry guns.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I can use violence. I’m not afraid of it,” he says. “But do we have to?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a question that grows more urgent as more Americans take up guns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So Brown is trying to drill his message home, again and again. In several of his scenarios, he tells students&nbsp;the best thing to do is to back down, disengage, even let yourself be a victim. It might save your life.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Just because you have a gun,” he says, “doesn’t mean you’ve got to use it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s driving the increase in global conflict?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is it a lack of global leadership? Political polarization? Resource stress and climate change?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">David Miliband sees a combination of all these factors and more. For the past 10 years, the former British foreign secretary has led the <a href="https://www.rescue.org/">International Rescue Committee</a> (IRC), a global NGO working on the frontlines of conflicts around the world to provide aid to refugees and other displaced people. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/361768/2024-election-biden-foreign-policy-trump-china-ukraine-russia">Aspen Security Forum</a>, Miliband sat down with Vox to discuss Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan, and other conflicts, as well as the new British government, which is led by his former political party, Labour, and includes his brother Edward Miliband as secretary of energy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Joshua Keating</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We now have several years of data showing the number of armed conflicts around the world <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/25/24049551/war-increasing-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ethiopia">increasing</a> in terms of both sheer numbers and casualties. Is it fair to say that the so-called “<a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/03/pinker-explains-the-long-peace/">long peace</a>” is coming to an end?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David Miliband</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t want to declare the end of the long peace for a particular reason, which is that the “peace” wasn&#8217;t very peaceful. It suggests a bit of a golden age that we’ve left, and we shouldn&#8217;t fall into that trap. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we do know is that today there are up to a dozen major conflicts — with major defined as more than 1,000 battlefield deaths [in one year] — and there are 50-plus civil conflicts of different kinds going on. The two conflicts that get the most attention, Ukraine and Gaza, are obviously in a different category than the civil wars that are dominant, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/354112/sudan-darfur-el-fasher-genocide-humanitarian-aid-neglect">Sudan being a prime example</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Secondly, what we also know is that in many countries there are many conflicts. There’s not one single conflict going on in Cameroon or in Nigeria or in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/18/24041696/cyberscams-myanmar-china-pig-butchering">Myanmar</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thirdly, to your point, we know that civilians are increasingly bearing the brunt of conflict and that there’s much more internationalization of civil conflict. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I think we’re in a period that we could describe as a flammable world. There’s a lot of tinder and a lot of it’s on fire. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Joshua Keating</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Okay, so let’s talk about the kindling for that fire. What are some of the underlying structural factors that you think might be driving this increase in the number of conflicts and their severity?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David Miliband</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, resource stress is a big conflict multiplier and that’s where you see this <a href="https://climate-conflict.org/">conflict/climate interface</a>. We also know that political systems that fail to manage compromise are a source of conflict. That’s been the story in Syria, and you could say that’s the story in Sudan as well. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We also know that the divisive elements of social media <a href="https://www.sipri.org/commentary/topical-backgrounder/2021/social-media-tool-peace-or-conflict">have driven toxicity</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also this point about the internationalization of conflict — you’ve got more and more actors thinking regionally and making their power plays. And I suppose that the other thing is that the biggest determinant of where civil conflicts break out is <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/02/18/how-civil-wars-start/">where there was one before</a>. So the failure to resolve conflict is a feeder of more conflict. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Joshua Keating</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recently, President Biden caused some controversy when he said that he’s done more for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/17/biden-israel-gaza-palestine#:~:text=While%20defending%20his%20administration's%20response,opened%20up%20all%20the%20assets.">Palestinian community than</a> anyone, by pressuring Israel to allow more aid into Gaza. Given what you’re seeing from Gaza and the work that IRC is doing there, how would you assess the international community’s use of pressure to bring more aid in?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David Miliband</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a very complicated — perhaps uniquely complicated — situation. But the sum total of the efforts is not yet delivering for either Palestinians in Gaza or for the hostages being held in Gaza. And so there’s an immense amount of frustration around the terrible situation facing civilians. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we’ve said is that the number of trucks going into an area isn’t a sufficient measure of humanitarian aid. You can get a truck across the border, but what happens to the aid once you get it across?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Joshua Keating</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Turning to Sudan, we’re about two decades removed from the era of the “Save Darfur” movement and the George W. Bush administration’s very close involvement with that country. Does it feel like it’s fallen somewhat off the global agenda considering the staggering scale of the crisis there?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David Miliband</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no doubt that there’s less global interest in Sudan today than 20 years ago. Twenty years ago, there was terrible loss of life, but also extraordinary international mobilization. A lot has changed in the wider world since then. There’s a lot of humility born of error and failure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a lot of fatigue. There’s also a new insistence on African solutions to African problems. So it’s the African Union that is in front of diplomacy there, not the UN Security Council, which is a change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But for sure, the situation is getting worse, not better. It’s the prototype of the modern civil war: very convoluted, involving internationally sponsored actors and spillover from the region. It’s very dark. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Joshua Keating</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then when it comes to Ukraine: That’s very different from these other conflicts. It’s interstate, versus a civil war. It’s very much on the international agenda. How is the humanitarian response different in a conflict like that?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David Miliband</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first way it’s very different is that it’s a middle-income country. Secondly, it borders Europe. It’s actually very unusual to have refugees flowing into rich countries. Seventy-five percent of the world’s refugees <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/insights/explainers/refugee-hosting-metrics.html">go to poorer parts of the world</a>. They go from Myanmar to Bangladesh or they go from the [Democratic Republic of Congo] to Tanzania. And those who’ve been going to Europe have been much better treated [than refugees from other conflicts].</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But where we work on the eastern front, on the frontlines, the parallels with other conflict zones are very real. Daily survival is an issue, basic services for people with health needs that were previously met. And there’s just an extraordinary level of combat going on.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Joshua Keating</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As someone who’s been in both government and the NGO sector, how do you make the case to voters in countries like the UK or the US that these international priorities should matter given how many serious issues are on the domestic agenda?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David Miliband</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think it’s very important to say that you’re not asking to solve international problems instead of solving domestic problems. We shouldn’t try to convince people that the quality of their schools or their streets are not the top priority. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Having said that, we’ve seen from Covid that problems can come from abroad if they’re not tackled there. There’s a real need to recognize that this is an age in which countries are more interdependent. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Joshua Keating</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What do you hope to see from Britain’s new government in terms of Britain’s international role?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David Miliband</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I think what we’re seeing is that geography still matters. The new government has made clear that they see [Britain’s] values and interests aligned with its European neighbors. They don’t want to refight the Brexit wars, but there’s no value in Britain and Europe pretending that they’re somehow in a different place. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They’re going to want British diplomacy to work in a multilateral system. They’re going to be watching the American election very closely. And they’re going to make clear that they see climate as a security issue, not just as an environmental issue. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Joshua Keating</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is there a particular conflict or pressing issue that you think people should be paying more attention to, that doesn’t get the same kind of headlines as the ones we’ve discussed?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David Miliband</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I mean, first of all, don’t forget about Syria. It’s been ongoing for more than a decade. There are 7 million civilians outside the country, and a similar number inside the country <a href="https://www.unrefugees.org/emergencies/syria/">who are displaced</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Don’t forget about the Rohingya in Bangladesh, but also don&#8217;t forget there are 3 million Burmese Myanmar citizens <a href="https://myanmar.un.org/en/273228-myanmar-emergency-update-1-june-2024">displaced internally</a>. Don’t forget about Afghanistan where there are still grave economic needs. The West promised when it left militarily that it wouldn’t leave politically or developmentally. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there are some places that are much more foreign for Western audiences: West Africa, Francophone Africa in particular. There’s a lot of dynamism in this region, but also a lot of challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You know, we [the IRC] are growing. I’m not really sure if that’s a good thing or a bad thing.&nbsp;</p>

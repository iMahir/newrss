<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last decade, it seemed possible for animal welfare advocates to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/03/business/plant-based-protein-revolution/index.html">dream</a> that the US might be on the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meat-substitutes-impossible-foods-beyond-meat-sales-skyrocket-2019-5">cusp</a> of a <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2019/9/18/the-beef-with-beef-fake-meat-market-growing-rapidly">meat-free</a> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-01-08/beyond-meat-founder-ethan-brown">revolution</a>. The plant-based meat maker Beyond Meat’s valuation <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/02/beyond-meat-ipo.html">soared</a> after it debuted on the stock market in 2019, a bet on future growth. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/oatly-pioneered-oat-milk-now-its-struggling-to-keep-up/358babff-d335-4fb8-876f-9e65df8ac108">Oatly</a> couldn’t produce enough of its dairy-free milk to keep up with demand, and plant-based Impossible Burgers were being served at both <a href="https://observer.com/2017/02/we-tried-a-michelin-star-version-of-silicon-valleys-plant-burger-that-bleeds-like-beef/">high-end restaurants</a> and fast food chains like White Castle and Burger King.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Impossible Foods founder Pat Brown even <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-present/plant-based-meat/">declared</a> that the world could replace the use of animals altogether for food by 2035.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But much of that optimism has since curdled into pessimism. <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2023-State-of-the-industry-report_Plant-based.pdf">Sales</a> in the alternative meat sector have slowed and a <a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/slumping-demand-forces-california-plant-based-startups-close/694295/">number</a> of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-22/fake-meat-companies-are-failing-as-money-dries-up-and-demand-slows">startups</a> have perished, leading multiple news outlets to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chloesorvino/2022/06/18/lifeless-market-for-meatless-meat/">eulogize</a> the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-01-19/beyond-meat-bynd-impossible-foods-burgers-are-just-another-food-fad">nascent industry</a>. The industry’s problems can largely be chalked up to the cold hard fact that so far, it’s failed in its fundamental proposition: Consumers don’t think their products <a href="https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/what-happened-to-plant-based-meat">taste good enough</a> to forgo conventional meat. Premature <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meat-substitutes-impossible-foods-beyond-meat-sales-skyrocket-2019-5">media hype</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90931204/beyond-impossible-disinformation-mystery-berman">meat industry-funded attack ads</a>, <a href="https://gfi.org/resource/analyzing-plant-based-meat-and-seafood-sales/">high price tags</a>, and a flurry of imitators flooding the market with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23065941/vegan-vegetarian-plant-based-food-tech-bad-products">mediocre or downright bad products</a> don’t help, either.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story is part of <strong>How Factory Farming Ends</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Read more from this special package analyzing the long fight against factory farming <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics">here</a>.</strong> This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The essential problem that plant-based meat was supposed to solve remains unchanged. Per capita, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-consumption-by-type-kilograms-per-year?country=~USA">US meat consumption</a> is only <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDA-Agricultural-Projections-to-2033.pdf">projected to increase</a> over the next decade, even as climate scientists <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">say</a> meat and dairy consumption in rich countries must decline rapidly to meet global climate targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The initial enthusiasm for plant-based meat was rooted in the idea that it was a more promising path to end the factory farming of animals than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/technology/bruce-friedrich-animal-activist.html">traditional activism</a>. Instead of changing people’s minds about what to eat, plant-based entrepreneurs and advocates sought to change meat itself. Based on the numbers, the payback on that bet is mixed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Grocery store plant-based meat sales in dollars soared from <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/4/17/23682232/impossible-beyond-plant-based-meat-sales">2017 to 2021</a>, but have since slightly declined. Even more troubling is the steep decline in the number of plant-based meat units sold at grocery stores, which fell <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2023-State-of-the-industry-report_Plant-based.pdf">26 percent</a> over the last two years (conventional meat sales dipped by just <a href="https://agfundernews.com/plant-based-by-numbers-usa-continued-declines-for-alt-meat-more-positive-news-for-alt-dairy-gfi#:~:text=For%20context%2C%20US%20retail%20sales,plant%2Dbased%20meat%20and%20seafood.">6 percent</a> over the same period). Plant-based meat <a href="https://gfi.org/resource/analyzing-plant-based-meat-and-seafood-sales/#foodservice-and-global-sales">sales</a> in restaurants and cafeterias — along with grocery stores outside the US — have remained flat or grown only slowly over the past few years.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/PQ4NZ-us-plant-based-meat-grocery-sales-spiked-then-flatlined-and-are-now-on-the-decline-nbsp-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,14.71659458229,100,70.56681083542" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But progress doesn’t always move in a straight line, and this could be a mere lull — a market correction after years of unstable growth and investor hype. In an attempt to jumpstart the plant-based industry again, a number of nonprofits and companies have set their sights on state legislatures and Capitol Hill, intensifying their lobbying to advance their cause (and bottom lines).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some are focused on directing more R&amp;D funding to “alternative protein,” an umbrella term that encompasses plant-based products, like those from Oatly and Beyond Meat, along with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/24/green-technology-precision-fermentation-farming">high-tech fermentation</a> and lab-grown or <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23768224/eat-just-good-meat-upside-cell-cultivated-chicken-lab-grown">“cell-cultivated” meat</a> — real meat made by directly growing animal cells, without the slaughter of a cow, chicken, pig or fish. Just as the federal government’s early R&amp;D funding for <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/20/18104206/solar-panels-cost-cheap-mit-clean-energy-policy">solar</a> and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/wind/history-of-wind-power.php">wind power</a> helped deliver cheap, abundant renewable energy, alternative protein advocates say R&amp;D funding could enable the sector to lower the prices and improve the taste and texture of its products.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some plant-based advocates are pushing in a more low-tech direction, working with schools and other federally-funded institutions to serve more beans, lentils, whole grains, and vegetables.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://gfi.org/team/jessica-almy-j-d/">Jessica Almy</a>, head of government relations for the Good Food Institute, an organization that advocates for alternative protein, said her organization seeks to create a “level playing field” between the conventional meat industry and the animal-free upstarts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The big idea here is that alternative proteins would compete in the free market,” she said, “and that consumers ultimately would decide the winners and the losers.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Currently, the meat market is not so free. The meat and dairy industries, which are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22379909/big-meat-companies-spend-millions-lobbying-climate">powerful forces</a> in Washington, have long benefited from a sprawling web of subsidies, R&amp;D programs, and government grants, receiving about <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/pdf/S2590-3322(23)00347-0.pdf">800 times</a> more public funding than the alternative protein sector from 2014 to 2020 despite the far greater costs they exert on <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22905381/meat-dairy-eggs-climate-change-emissions-rewilding">the environment</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Our national policies continue to favor and fund high-emissions industries who promote unsustainable food systems and diets,” as Pearson Croney-Clark, public affairs manager for Oatly, put it in an email to Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consumers’ choices are determined by a number of factors beyond taste and price, like our <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.ade6561">upbringing</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZIjv-7fbiwRoU9O5jmJ0xAUK2KqLqZSA6UzNteECbqY/edit#:~:text=Social%20norms%20may%20affect%20food,sensory%2Fhedonic%20evaluation%20of%20foods.">social norms</a>. The very idea of meat’s necessity at every meal is stubbornly engrained in America’s DNA, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">US factory farming has <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">scaled</a> to fulfill that belief, though the treatment of animals represents nothing short of a moral atrocity future generations will look back on in horror. We’ve long had a bounty of plant-based foods ready to replace much of it — think beans, lentils, whole grains, vegetables, and tofu — that might find more purchase among the American public if served up in more creative ways. Better tasting and more affordable plant-based meat products would help, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To give the plant-based food movement a fighting chance to bring our food system in line with planetary boundaries, we have to shift a policy landscape that for too long has benefitted the foods that do the most harm to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22905381/meat-dairy-eggs-climate-change-emissions-rewilding">the environment</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/9/12/23339898/global-meat-production-forecast-factory-farming-animal-welfare-human-progress">animals</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">public health</a>. The movement’s fledgling influence campaign has already shown that progress is possible, and its broader agenda — a number of incremental but promising reforms — holds potential to actually move the needle on American meat consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting the next generation of meat alternatives from lab to table</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The cost of various clean energy technologies, such as <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/11/20/18104206/solar-panels-cost-cheap-mit-clean-energy-policy">solar panels</a> and <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/wind/history-of-wind-power.php">wind turbines</a>, have plummeted in recent decades. We can thank the federal government, which funded early stage R&amp;D, for much of that progress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s just as true for America’s highly industrialized meat and dairy industry, which has benefited from <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/oc/timeline/comp/">over a century</a> of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/357195/land-grant-universities-greenwashing-climate-methane-factory-farming">government support</a> to build factory farming.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alternative protein advocates say investing more of America’s agricultural R&amp;D budget in their sector could be crucial to improving products, and thereby increase their commercial viability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Early stage R&amp;D is more of a focus for this sector in particular because the products are so early in their development, and we think they can be so much better than they are,” Almy said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates like Almy are starting to get what they want. In 20212, Congress approved around <a href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/117th-congress/house-report/82/1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22protein%22%2C%22%5C%22Appropriations%5C%22%22%2C%22protein%22%5D%7D&amp;s=7&amp;r=1">$5 million annually</a> for the USDA to conduct in-house alternative protein research, and it’s already been dispersed to agency labs around the country. Projects include investigating how different strains of lentils and chickpeas affect flavor, the<a href="https://www.ifst.org/lovefoodlovescience/resources/functional-properties-food"> functional properties</a> of soybeans, and food safety measures.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s still a paltry 0.1 percent of the USDA’s <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2022/june/investment-in-u-s-public-agricultural-research-and-development-has-fallen-by-a-third-over-past-two-decades-lags-major-trade-competitors/#:~:text=In%202019%20(the%20last%20year,(in%20constant%202019%20dollars).">$5 billion annual R&amp;D budget</a>. But it was a start.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The USDA also recently funded university research into breeding a higher protein strain of <a href="https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&amp;id=anon&amp;pass=&amp;search=R=100615&amp;format=WEBFMT6NT">fava beans</a> and developing <a href="https://cris.nifa.usda.gov/cgi-bin/starfinder/0?path=fastlink1.txt&amp;id=anon&amp;pass=&amp;search=R=98884&amp;format=WEBLINK">plant-based seafood</a>, and the US Department of Defense has <a href="https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/news/cornucopia-project">taken</a> some <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/61d9c20c46d51b49b50f6229/t/665dfd4a27584a0fe2509d7d/1717435724676/SLAM+Project+Call.pdf">interest</a> in the sector, too. There’s also been movement at the state level: In 2022, <a href="https://gfi.org/blog/gfi-commends-californias-landmark-5-million-investment-in-the-future-of-protein/">California</a> invested $5 million into alternative protein research at public universities, while <a href="https://gov.illinois.gov/news/press-release.30189.html">Illinois</a> has helped launch a biotechnology hub that will in part work on alternative protein projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">R&amp;D is even more crucial to cell-cultivated meat, which promises to provide precisely the same animal-based product consumers eat today — provided the cost can come down from the rafters. While the US government has approved two cell-cultivated meat companies to sell their products, they aren’t yet for sale. Startups still need to overcome a range of technical and economic challenges to scale up and compete with conventionally grown meat on cost, and <a href="https://thecounter.org/lab-grown-cultivated-meat-cost-at-scale/">some scientists</a> believe they never will. Those challenges <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23378912/meat-animals-beef-cultivated-in-vitro-food-plant-based-animal-welfare-impossible-burger">include</a> making animal cells grow faster, preventing bacterial contamination, and building an affordable supply chain of feed for the cells. A <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/bay-area-lab-meat-company-shuts-down-19511362.php#">couple</a> cell-cultivated <a href="https://agfundernews.com/cultivated-meat-startup-new-age-eats-makes-painful-decision-to-shut-down">startups</a> have gone under and several have laid off employees.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Venture capitalists have poured around <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2022-Cultivated-Meat-State-of-the-Industry-Report-2-1.pdf">$3 billion</a> across more than 150 startups globally, which sounds like a lot, but it’s a pittance compared to how much has been invested into <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/investment-in-clean-energy-this-year-is-set-to-be-twice-the-amount-going-to-fossil-fuels">other sustainable technologies</a>. Considering the enormous difficulty in shifting consumers’ diets to be more climate friendly, cell-cultivated meat proponents say it’s more than worthy of government R&amp;D funding. That has finally begun to trickle in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few years ago, scientists at <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/food/news/uc-davis-establishes-research-training-cultivated-meat">the University of California-Davis</a> and <a href="https://now.tufts.edu/2021/10/15/tufts-receives-10-million-grant-help-develop-cultivated-meat">Tufts University</a> received millions of dollars from government agencies to study cell-cultivated meat. <a href="https://upsidefoods.com/bio/sean-edgett">Sean Edgett</a>, chief legal officer of Upside Foods — a large cell-cultivated meat startup — described these programs as doing important “table stakes” work, basic research that can help new companies get off the ground more easily and build a talent pipeline for companies like Upside.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The alternative protein industry is working to expand the pot of federal and state research dollars through the <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Farm-Bill_AFRI_fact-sheet.pdf">next Farm Bill</a> and other pieces of legislation. Rep. Julia Brownley (D-CA) introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5097?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22julia+brownley%22%7D&amp;s=5&amp;r=3">PROTEIN Act</a> last year, which would establish alternative protein research centers in at least three universities and a dedicated research program under the USDA. Meanwhile, Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) has introduced the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5023/text">PLANT Act</a> to provide support for farmers who grow common ingredients in plant-based products and set up a program to help companies better market their products, similar to an existing USDA <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/dbi">program</a> for conventional dairy businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Making school food climate-friendly</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=107561#:~:text=The%20USDA's%20National%20School%20Lunch,can%20get%20an%20NSLP%20lunch.">5 billion meals</a> served at school cafeterias each year through the National School Lunch Program, the lunch line has long been considered an opportunity to build a more healthy and sustainable food system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even in crunchy California, for example, meat and dairy dominates school food, with only <a href="https://civileats.com/2023/09/19/california-leads-the-way-in-low-carbon-school-meals/">8 percent</a> of entrees entirely plant-based. Evening out that ratio could help improve student health, as a more “flexitarian” diet — one lower in animal-based foods and higher in plant-based foods — can improve <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5216044/">metabolic health</a> and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31788-4/abstract">reduce risk</a> of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US federal dietary guidelines <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf">report</a> that children and teenagers tend to under-consume plant-based foods. Changing that, at least in the school cafeteria, would also increase kids’ intake of fiber, a critical nutrient that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/20/18214505/fiber-diet-weight-loss">95 percent</a> of Americans don’t get enough of and is found only in plant foods.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To that end, a <a href="https://www.forkidsandtheplanet.com/">coalition</a> of environmental, public health, and animal welfare organizations recently secured a substantive win in the USDA’s <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/cn/school-nutrition-standards-updates">recent updates</a> to school nutrition standards. Those updates include giving schools more flexibility to serve beans, lentils, and tofu, allowing nuts and seeds to be served as a meat alternative, and allowing the option to serve hummus and other bean dips as a snack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That increased flexibility is a real opportunity,” said <a href="https://www.balanced.org/about">Audrey Lawson-Sanchez</a>, executive director of Balanced, a plant-based nutrition group in the coalition. “Now it really is going to be about making sure that [school] food service teams… actually have the skills and the resources” to act on the flexibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The demand is there, Lawson-Sanchez said, pointing to an <a href="https://www.ilga.gov/legislation/102/HB/PDF/10200HB4089lv.pdf">Illinois law</a> that went into effect last August which requires schools to serve plant-based meals to kids who request them. So far, she said, students at around 15 percent of the state’s 852 school districts have asked for them. Lawson-Sanchez’s group set up a pilot program at eight schools to help them meet those requests, and one was so successful that it now has one fully plant-based day per week and one 50 percent plant-based day per week.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But schools need money to implement new programs, and plant-based advocates have drawn inspiration from the USDA’s <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/f2s/farm-school-grant-program">Farm to School grant program</a>, which helps schools set up gardens and bring local food into K-12 cafeterias by working with farmers. A specifically plant-based version could be used to train school chefs, develop new recipes, and market new dishes to students; last year, Rep. Nydia M. Velázquez (D-NY) and Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) <a href="https://velazquez.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/velazquez-bowman-introduce-legislation-provide-plant-based-entrees">introduced</a> a bill to fund such a program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates and policymakers also see breaking <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">Big Dairy’s iron grip</a> on school food and making it easier to get dairy-free milk as a ripe opportunity for change. Currently, schools <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">must at least offer cow’s milk</a> at every meal and few carry plant-based options. <a href="https://www.usda.gov/foodlossandwaste/schools#:~:text=Offer%2Dversus%2Dserve%20(OVS,schools%20used%20OVS%20at%20lunch).">One out of five</a> elementary and middle schools participating in the National School Lunch Program go so far as to require all students to take cow’s milk, even though kids throw away <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/tag/food-loss-and-waste">nearly half</a> of it, and many students — especially those of color — are <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/lactose-intolerance#:~:text=Lactose%20intolerance%20is%20most%20common,be%20managed%20through%20diet%20changes.">lactose intolerant</a>. If a kid wants a dairy-free option, like soy milk, they have to provide a note from a doctor or parent, depending on their reason.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rep. Robert Scott (D-VA), ranking chair of the US House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which oversees school nutrition policy, wants to change that. A Democratic aide on that committee told Vox that Rep. Scott’s <a href="https://www.congress.gov/member/robert-scott/S000185">child nutrition reauthorization bill</a> would loosen restrictions preventing students from getting plant milk alternatives, and set up a $2 million fund for schools to cover some of the cost of plant-based milk purchases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates in the school food coalition also want to see the USDA encourage more plant-based options, allow high-protein grains like quinoa to count as a meat alternative, adopt minimum fiber standards, and make cow’s milk optional at all schools.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond school lunches, the federal government directly buys billions of dollars of food each year for food banks, federal building cafeterias, and more. By one <a href="https://www.fedgoodfoodpurchasing.org/resources/impact-analysis-full-report">estimate</a>, nearly 90 percent of the protein-rich foods it purchases are animal products. In recent years, there’s been an internal push at the Department of Defense — which makes up about half of federal food purchases — to shift some of its food to plant-based. Some military bases are <a href="https://www.stripes.com/theaters/us/fort-sill-s-dining-facility-is-the-first-to-offer-troops-a-100-percent-plant-based-entre-e-at-every-meal-1.568203">serving more plant-based meals</a>, and recent DoD nutrition standards now <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/133810m.pdf">require legumes</a> to be served every day at military base cafeterias.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In April, for the first time in a decade, the USDA <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/wic/food-packages/qas">updated</a> its standards for the Women, Infant, and Children’s program — another major government food purchaser. The updates include a reduction in the amount of cow’s milk participants can purchase and more flexibility to buy plant-based dairy products and fruits and vegetables. Oatly saw it as a win, while a major dairy industry group said it was “<a href="https://www.nmpf.org/nmpf-disturbed-at-usda-final-wic-rule-that-decreases-dairy-access/">disturbed</a>” by the new rule.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond federal agencies, other institutions can enact policies to put plant-based foods at the center of our plates. For example, <a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/pressrelease/nyc-health-hospitals-celebrates-1-2-million-plant-based-meals-served/">New York City’s</a> hospital system reduced its food carbon footprint by more than a third by making plant-based meals the default option, <a href="https://defaultveg.medium.com/hundreds-of-universities-are-moving-toward-a-plant-based-norm-7506609d0ab2#:~:text=In%20universities%2C%20they're%20more,and%20universities%20in%20North%20America!">universities</a> are increasing their meat-free offerings, and in some countries, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22883795/food-industry-plant-based-vegan-meat-dairy-climate-pledges">major food companies</a> have committed to making a larger share of their protein-rich products plant-based.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A level playing field for meat alternatives</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following a playbook deployed by the <a href="https://senate.ucsd.edu/media/206150/lobby_spend_report__april.pdf">fossil fuel industry</a> against the renewable energy sector, the conventional <a href="https://www.ncba.org/ncba-news/news-releases/news/details/36527/ncba-backs-fair-labels-act-to-end-deceptive-fake-meat-labeling-practices">meat</a> and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2023/08/deep-pocketed-dairy-industry-continues-war-on-plant-based-milk-as-fda-hears-comments-on-new-draft-guidance/">dairy</a> industry and its legislative allies are now striving to hamstring its competition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over a dozen states have passed laws to restrict how plant-based meat, dairy, and egg companies can label their products, with some banning usage of words like “sausage” or “cheese,” even if accompanied by clarifying phrases like “vegetarian,” “plant-based,” or “animal-free.” Some of those laws have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/14/24069722/political-ban-cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-plant-based-labeling-laws">overturned or weakened</a>, but state lawmakers — and <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/549">members of Congress</a>, too — continue to introduce new bills.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Legislative attacks against the cell-cultivated startups are more existential. Earlier this year, Florida and Alabama’s state legislatures <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/14/24069722/political-ban-cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-plant-based-labeling-laws">banned</a> the sale and production of cell-cultivated meat, and several other states have introduced bans. (In late June, days before the Florida ban took effect, Upside Foods gave out free cell-cultivated meat in Miami.) </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/UPSIDE-Foods-2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A man speaking to a crowd using a microphone." title="A man speaking to a crowd using a microphone." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Shortly before Florida’s cell-cultivated meat ban took effect, Upside Foods gave out its cell-cultivated chicken at an event in Miami. The company’s CEO, Uma Valeti, addresses the crowd. | Upside Foods" data-portal-copyright="Upside Foods" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, the bans are purely symbolic, as cell-cultivated meat is nowhere near commercial viability.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alternative protein producers want to stop these discriminatory regulations, but they also want to benefit from some of the government assistance that the conventional meat industry enjoys. One of those is low-interest federal loans, an unglamorous but potentially powerful tool for launching novel, capital-intensive technologies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take Tesla, for example. In 2010, the company got a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/03/16/this-government-loan-program-helped-tesla-at-a-critical-time-trump-wants-to-cut-it/">$465 million loan</a> from the US Department of Energy that it used to build a manufacturing plant that eventually brought the Model S to American roads. Cell-cultivated meat companies will likely need this level of government support to scale, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US Department of Energy <a href="https://gfi.org/event/accessing-financing-through-the-department-of-energy/">recently opened</a> its loan application program to alternative protein companies, which could be a lifeline as venture capital funding has <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90984752/venture-capital-vc-funding-2023-bloodbath-by-the-numbers">dried up</a> across the economy. (Upside and its competitor GOOD Meat have paused plans to build out large manufacturing facilities.) Edgett said other <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/business-programs/business-industry-loan-guarantees">federal loan programs</a> should be expanded and made accessible to alternative protein companies, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He also wants to see a smoother regulatory process with the USDA and the US Food and Drug Administration, which share oversight of the cell-cultivated meat industry and must both sign off on new products. Upside Foods’ cell-cultivated chicken has already been approved for sale but many other companies still have applications waiting for action.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Edgett said the two agencies “could just do more to make expectations clear” by publishing guidance for startups and establishing a uniform process for how these products will be labeled. Currently, he said, label approval is a one-off process for each company. The sector could receive some clarity later this year, as the USDA is <a href="https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2024/06/12/usda-pushes-forward-label-updates-for-cultured-meat-uncured-claims-nutrition-facts">expected</a> to publish a proposed rule on the matter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m really thinking about a lot of these cultivated meat companies that have such short runways, and they’re running out of capital,” Edgett said. “And I think they’ve hit a wall on the regulatory side, just because it’s slower than they expected, or it’s fairly opaque.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For any chance of success, alternative protein companies will need every obstacle moved out of their way, including what some consider to be a needlessly slow regulatory process. This may be especially important for startups whose products could be market-ready if only they had federal approval. For example, companies including <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/02/plant-based-meat-lab-grown-animal-fat-flavor/673190/">Mission Barns</a>, <a href="https://agfundernews.com/crunch-time-for-cultivated-meat-probably-70-90-of-players-will-fail-in-the-next-year">Meatable, and Mosa Meat</a> aren’t seeking to produce 100 percent cell-cultivated meat or anything close to it, but rather, are making <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23378912/meat-animals-beef-cultivated-in-vitro-food-plant-based-animal-welfare-impossible-burger">“hybrid” alternative meat</a> — plant-based meat blended with a small percent of cell-based fat or protein to achieve a meatier flavor. These products in theory will be easier to scale and more affordable than their more purist competitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The movement for a food system with fewer animal products has had a tumultuous decade, and ultimately, lower prices and tastier products won’t guarantee it experiences another major upswing. But meat’s outsized carbon and pollution footprint has, thus far, been a gaping hole in America’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/8/8/23296951/inflation-reduction-act-biden-democrats-climate-change#">ambitious</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/5/7/22423139/biden-30-by-30-conservation-initiative-historic">environmental plans</a>. To make progress on those goals, policymakers will need to show a willingness to move in a more plant-based direction. If done correctly, that could ease the increasing <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/11/18/23458234/jim-pillen-governor-nebraska-pigs-pork-plant-based-meat-water-pollution-nitrates">politicization of meat</a>. It could also determine whether the development of better plant-based meat becomes a viable path to changing the food system — or remains a niche category.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many people think of animal rights and veganism, at least in the West, as a relatively contemporary phenomenon — and a niche one at that. Despite all the buzz surrounding plant-based diets, the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/510038/identify-vegetarian-vegan.aspx">share</a> of Americans who call themselves vegan or vegetarian is in the single digits and may have even decreased in recent decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there was once a time when the animal rights movement had gained such cultural significance that, as Irish playwright, Nobel laureate, and vegetarian George Bernard Shaw <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k-LdQ0cMa4AfC09lSxMkpJToDRQVdgYW/view?usp=drivesdk">remarked</a> in a 1906 address to the London Vegetarian Association, “I am beginning to be astonished at the difficulty I now have in finding anybody who eats meat.”&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One surprising thing</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">You might associate vegetarianism with the hippies and environmentalists of the 1960s and ’70s. It’s true that the vegetarian movement had a renaissance in the last 50 years, as factory farming took over our food system, but its roots in Western countries go back a lot further. Throughout the 19th century, vegetarianism was all the rage and had adherents in other progressive movements, like the fight for women’s suffrage.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><br><strong>This piece is part of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics">How Factory Farming Ends</a>, a collection of stories on the past and future of the long fight against factory farming.</strong> This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, long before we had high-tech meat alternatives, the Western world saw a surge of interest in meatless diets and animal welfare. This early wave of vegetarianism — a movement I’ll call animal rights 1.0 — was connected to a range of other social justice issues of the day, including women’s rights and the abolition of slavery. Suffragist Maud Joachim, a member of the Women’s Social and Political Union who was jailed multiple times for her activism, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZlI-ASxBqWxvnBLhk5ytUTaPHGeyLA5/view?usp=sharing">wrote in 1908,</a> “It is a strange fact that the ranks of the militant suffragettes are mostly recruited from the mild vegetarians … and the authorities [in prison] have allowed us a special vegetarian diet.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The vegetarian cause also attracted the attention of prominent abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who regularly met with newspaper editor, politician, and vegetarian reformer Horace Greeley at <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yrgY35WKgF0FnjGTFrySuxIRh9hD7Bj5/view?usp=sharing">Grahamite boarding houses</a>. Named after anti-meat advocate and graham cracker creator Sylvester Graham, these houses were hot spots for abolitionists, temperance advocates, anti-tobacco activists, and vegetarians. The <a href="https://education.rspca.org.uk/documents/1494931/0/FS+The+story+of+the+RSPCA+(A).pdf/935a7bb3-7863-bc9d-827a-69b0341dfad6?t=1555163255316">founding</a> of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) in London in 1824 and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) in 1866 were part of the same broader humanitarian and reformist wave.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While today’s animal rights activists struggle to attain mainstream attention and credibility, these problems did not seem insurmountable to the 19th-century vegetarians. The British socialist, women’s rights activist, and advocate for self-rule in India Annie Besant declared in an 1897 <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k-LdQ0cMa4AfC09lSxMkpJToDRQVdgYW/view?usp=drivesdk">speech</a> that “the food reform movement has outlived the period of ridicule; it is entering on a period … of recognition amongst all thoughtful and intelligent people.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Besant and other vegetarian adherents believed it was simply wrong to exploit those who lack power, whoever they were, and connected violence against animals with violence against humans. A vegetarian diet “strikes at the root of all evil,” English poet Percy Bysshe Shelley declared. Advocacy against vivisection, or animal experimentation — on the basis not just of its cruelty to animals but also because it inures those who practice it to cruelty to humans — also enjoyed more legitimacy than it does today.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The imposing gothic-style cathedral of the 19th-century <a href="https://x.com/carlylheath/status/1605736405983891456?s=46&amp;t=MV1RDDxsWUD0EGcfg8aZEA">Vegetarian Society</a> headquarters in London symbolized just how well-positioned the movement appeared to combat the <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-victorians-caused-the-meat-eating-crisis-the-world-faces-today-but-they-might-help-us-solve-it-109310">emerging threat</a> of large-scale industrialized animal slaughter more than 150 years ago. Yet despite the successes of concurrent social reform movements like the abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage, and children’s rights, animal rights 1.0 now feels like a distant golden age.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-1442789427.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.9188356421754,100,80.162328715649" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A large dinner held in London’s Freemason’s Hall for the Vegetarian Society, in the middle of the 19th century." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Far from fulfilling animal rights advocates’ utopian dreams, the 20th century instead saw the rise of modern intensive animal agriculture, along with a vast public-private bureaucracy designed to ensure its profitability and protect it from public scrutiny. Over the last century, America’s per capita meat consumption has <a href="https://www.agweb.com/opinion/drivers-us-capita-meat-consumption-over-last-century">nearly doubled.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The industry worked to push its products onto consumers through a system of generous public subsidies, regulatory capture, and an agricultural policy focused on flooding the market with cheap meat and dairy — all while keeping up the sacred American illusion of a free market. It has thoroughly captured and absorbed the US Department of Agriculture, along with my profession, veterinarians — who have perhaps more influence than any other over the treatment of animals — into its slaughter-industrial complex.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After a period of dormancy, the animal rights movement <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13t0QgKufDjwAd9dGtIyBxhXg1n1KGjhx/view?usp=sharing">re-emerged</a> in recent decades with a consumer choice-focused message: “Go vegan!” But against animal agriculture’s economic and political power, urging individuals to restructure their lives around a meatless diet was no longer a strategic ask. The livestock industry recognized what animal rights activists had not: Demand for its products could not be left up to the whims of consumer choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, factory farming poses ever-greater threats to society, including the rise of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24128700/bird-fludairy-meat-industry-h5n1-cows-milk-eggs-safety">viruses of pandemic potential</a>,<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline"> climate change</a>, and the moral abomination of large-scale animal slaughter. The time is ripe to take on the meat industry. The activists of animal rights 1.0 showed us that radical change is possible, but to realize their vision, today’s strategies will need to be fundamentally different. Animal advocates are increasingly recognizing a need to focus less on telling consumers to avoid meat and more on changing the systems that force all of us to prop up corporate animal exploitation, whether we buy its products or not.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The vegetarian movement couldn’t compete with </strong>the rise of factory farming</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KdOvnNoT4UdZ2I4_ZKBMZFzAkBCSjQ8H/view">extensive writing</a> of Russian author Leo Tolstoy on vegetarianism and animal slaughter is often summed up in the apocryphal <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/42064-as-long-as-there-are-slaughter-houses-there-will-always">quote</a>: “As long as there are slaughterhouses, there will always be battlefields.” The reverse may also be true. The world wars of the 20th century shattered the utopian aspirations that had once flourished.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As European farmers became soldiers, American farmers were called to pick up the slack and <a href="https://www.worldwar1centennial.org/index.php/food-will-win-the-war-articles/1450-food-will-win-the-war-article-3.html">feed</a> the Allied forces by producing grain and meat that could be easily shipped abroad. In 1917, a meat industry trade journal <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x1kp5-OMPoLhD5L9CRAa6ZFf1H3Vg49X/view?usp=drivesdk">foreshadowed</a> the coming intensification of US agriculture, writing that “the stern necessity of war has created an undreamed of efficiency that will last long after the war. We, as a nation, must compete with that efficiency if we are going to hold any share of trade in the world.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">War also annihilated the foundations of the vegetarian movement in parts of the world. At the dawn of World War I, the Russian Empire was home to a vibrant vegetarian community; a Kyiv Vegetarian Society canteen, one of about a dozen vegetarian canteens in the city, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oPDwx8604LuamyKvJjHbIHsGe8Cn1LPs/view?usp=sharing">served</a> more than 200,000 visitors in 1911. Jews made up the single largest group of diners at the canteens, according to a 1912 survey. By the end of World War II, the Holocaust had decimated Eastern Europe’s Jewish population.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the interwar and postwar periods in the <a href="https://www.thelugarcenter.org/printpilot-news-409.pdf?1715651599">US</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24146466/europe-farmer-protests-eu-climate-environmental-policy-subsidies-livestock">Europe</a>, governments poured money into agriculture to boost productivity and food security. Agricultural yields <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/42826/11496_eb10_1_.pdf?v=3571">improved</a> dramatically, allowing farms to produce more food with fewer inputs. Biomedical innovations like the advent of antibiotics, combined with novel methods of extreme confinement and selective breeding, fueled the rise of modern intensive animal agriculture, along with meat giants like <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/11/25/cargill-deforestation-agriculture-history-pollution/">Cargill</a> and Tyson, that could mass produce unfathomable numbers of animals for slaughter.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The livestock industry recognized what animal rights activists had not: Demand for its products could not be left up to the whims of consumer choice</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animal rights movement couldn’t compete. By 2022, the US slaughtered <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">more than 10 billion</a> land animals for food. Almost paradoxically, the imperative to squeeze as much profit from as few inputs as possible enabled the expansion of animal agriculture, the least-efficient, most resource-intensive form of food production. Producing billions of animals for slaughter <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/land-use-diets">requires growing</a> many times more crops to feed them than simply farming plant-based foods — so much that <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034015/pdf">two-thirds</a> of crop calories grown in the US are fed not to humans, but to farmed animals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Big Ag’s ascent after World War II, this inefficiency became a feature, not a bug. As historian Ariel Ron <a href="https://www.phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-iron-farm-bill/">put it</a>, “the astonishing profusion of commodity crop production required finding new ways to upsell calories for an affluent consumer society. Meat was the economic solution to the historically unprecedented problem of large structural caloric surpluses.” In short, the agriculture industry could make more money feeding animals for human consumption than it could directly feeding crops to humans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The levels of meat and dairy consumption that Americans take for granted today are a product not of innate consumer demand but of a kind of welfare state for agribusiness that works to create a guaranteed market for the livestock industry’s products. The federal government has come to serve as animal agriculture’s benefactor, customer, and advertiser. American taxpayers pay animal agriculture tens of billions of dollars through a labyrinthine system of subsidy programs managed by the US Department of Agriculture that shield it from risk and competition. One of the <a href="https://farm.ewg.org/region.php?fips=00000&amp;progcode=total&amp;yr=2023">biggest beneficiaries</a> is the dairy industry, which derives about 73 percent of its revenue from some form of subsidy, according to one <a href="http://www.greyclark.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/US-Subsidies-Post-2014-Farm-Bill-FEB-2018.pdf">2015 estimate</a>.&nbsp;To name one example, milk is given to schoolchildren through the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp">National School Lunch Program</a>, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">requires schools to serve milk</a> to millions of students every day at public expense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To help stabilize prices and ensure farmers&#8217; economic stability, the government buys up <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/government-cheese">vast quantities</a> of surplus products. This has led to massive <a href="https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/pg15bd892/rf560z098/6m313c90v/cost0624.pdf">stockpiles</a>, including the federal government’s well-known “cheese caves.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ensuring a stable food supply in this way does not have to be bad policy — and the federal government does stockpile fruits and vegetables, too. But by propping up our ruinous system of animal agriculture, policymakers allow corporations to extract more than their fair share from taxpayers, while threatening <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9629715/">public health</a> and the climate and <a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news/the-sinister-hog-industry-of-eastern-north-carolina/">contaminating</a> our <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652620337896#:~:text=Costco%20sources%20beef%20from%20the,burdens%20along%20the%20supply%20chain.">air</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/06/animal-agriculture-nitrate-water">water</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The livestock industry is shielded from the costs of these externalities. Federal law even requires the USDA to oversee marketing programs for the meat and dairy industries and other agricultural products, known as <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/rules-regulations/research-promotion">checkoff programs</a>, which are funded by fees collected from producers on a portion of their sales.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More insidious than the subsidies and the government-funded advertising campaigns, though, are the livestock industry’s efforts to more directly engineer Americans’ consumption habits, making purchases of their products a reflex rather than a conscious decision. “If you build a habit, something they will do day in and day out, you’ve got a great business. Google is a toothbrush. Facebook is a toothbrush,” Mohan Sawhney, a marketing professor at Northwestern University, was <a href="https://www.porkbusiness.com/opinion/why-pork-industry-needs-build-toothbrush">reported</a> saying at a growth and innovation webinar for the National Pork Board. “We’ve got to make pork into a toothbrush — not something that’s exotic, that you do occasionally.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The dairy industry’s USDA-sponsored marketing boards have poured resources into getting more of its products into fast food restaurants, where <a href="https://www.driveresearch.com/market-research-company-blog/fast-food-consumption-statistics/">two-thirds of Americans</a> eat at least once a week. Dairy Management Inc., an arm of the Dairy Checkoff program, in 2009 placed <a href="https://hoards.com/print-article-19407-permanent.html">scientists</a> in positions at McDonald’s to stuff more dairy into its menu items — adding butter to Egg McMuffins, featuring milk in Happy Meals, and introducing the now-discontinued <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mcdonalds-menu-changes-over-years-history-2019-4#orange-hi-c-16">Mozzarella Sticks</a> and Buttermilk Crispy Chicken — which helped them sell an additional 500 million pounds of dairy products annually, a dairy industry publication reported in 2016. Similar <a href="https://grist.org/food/butter-board-viral-dairy-lobby/">strategies</a> at other fast food chains have reportedly increased the amount of cheese on menu items as much as <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/government-cheese">eightfold</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Where the modern movement against factory farming went wrong</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animal rights movement reconstituted roughly 50 years ago with the publication of philosopher Peter Singer’s <em>Animal Liberation</em> in 1975. The now-classic book <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23737349/peter-singer-philosophy-animal-welfare-factory-farming-euthanasia-disabled-ethics#">brought</a> veganism and animal advocacy to a new generation of activists at a time when animal slaughter had been systematized and mechanized in ways the Victorian-era vegetarians could have never imagined. New groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), founded in 1980, and a crop of farm animal rights organizations in the ensuing decades aimed to expose conditions inside animal production facilities and slaughterhouses to persuade the public to stop eating animals.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>For a population that had gotten hooked on cheap meat and dairy, the animal movement’s message was polarizing, judgmental, and restrictive. To be vegan was to be morally superior.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The activists of animal rights 2.0 successfully drew public attention to the contemporary plight of slaughter-bound animals. Their call to action, though, was one that could only be adopted by those with the personality and mindset to resist social pressure and the meat industry’s glut of publicly subsidized products. It was fundamentally a movement built on individuals’ consumption choices, which made for committed activists but also an insular, fractious community that has struggled to convince a critical mass of the public to change its diet. For a population that had gotten hooked on cheap meat and dairy, the animal movement’s message was <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18055532/vegans-vegetarian-research-uk">polarizing</a>, judgmental, and restrictive. To be vegan was to be morally superior.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By framing animal exploitation as a consumer issue, animal advocates unwittingly reified&nbsp;animal agriculture’s narrative: that eating their products was a matter of personal choice&nbsp; — a choice that vegan extremists sought to <a href="https://www.drovers.com/news/education/scorecards-and-incremental-changes-how-extremists-are-targeting-consumer-choice">take away</a>. In reality, the meat industry has fought to ensure that we’re all forced to pay them, whether we buy their products or not. Consumers have no ability to opt out of, for example, paying for the cruel <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">taxpayer-funded exterminations</a> of tens of millions of animals taking place now at poultry giants like Tyson and Jennie-O because of the poultry industry’s failure to adequately prepare for bird flu. Vegan or not, few people want to see these mega-corporations <a href="https://www.ourhonor.org/blognew/bailouts">bailed out</a> on the public’s dime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, the animal movement has diversified&nbsp;its work beyond vegan advocacy to tactics from <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">welfare reforms</a> on animal confinements to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23647682/factory-farming-dxe-criminal-trial-rescue">taking direct action</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23980010/cellular-agriculture-consortiums-collaboration-alternative-meat-lab-grown">investing</a> in the next generation of meat alternatives. But it still lacks a coherent strategy to change the foundational agricultural policies that give livestock production the upper hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One promising route to doing that may be through the veterinary profession, a key gatekeeper standing between animal agriculture and the public purse. The public expects vets to advocate for animals’ interests, but right now, organized veterinary medicine is captive to the livestock industry, often serving to “legitimize practices that cause extreme, prolonged pain and suffering on a massive scale” for animals raised for food, as veterinarian Gwendolen Reyes-Illg <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23516639/veterinarians-avma-factory-farming-ventilation-shutdown">told</a> Vox last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animal agriculture and pharmaceutical industries (the latter profits from selling vaccines, antibiotics, and other medications to slaughter-bound animals) have become <a href="https://www.avma.org/events/avma-convention/sponsors">heavily entangled</a> with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), the country’s leading veterinary organization, which helps shape federal and state policy on how animals are treated. Livestock companies give veterinary students <a href="https://aabp.org/about/Cargill_winners.asp">scholarships</a>, <a href="https://vetmed.tamu.edu/news/press-releases/alliance-with-cargillnutrena-inc/">forge partnerships</a> with <a href="https://olathe.k-state.edu/about/news/2020/august/haley-larson-joins-olathe-campus-as-animal-health-professor.html">veterinary schools</a> and production-optimizing <a href="https://www.cargill.com/2023/cargill-provides-support-to-university-of-idahos-center">animal science programs</a>, and even build their own veterinary schools <a href="https://www.eco-business.com/press-releases/cargill-builds-70th-school-in-vietnam/">abroad</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, the AVMA <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=7765">endorsed</a> federal legislation designed to invalidate one of the most important farm animal welfare laws ever passed in the US: California’s Proposition 12, which bans the pork industry’s confinement of pigs in gestation crates, cages barely larger than their bodies. In the bird flu outbreak of the last few years, the AVMA has played a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36611748/">central role</a> in enabling factory farms’ dependence on ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+), a method being used to mass cull chickens and turkeys on farms hit with bird flu by heating them to death in sealed sheds. It’s one of the most shockingly cruel meat industry developments in recent memory, and it’s being carried out at taxpayers’ expense.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Livestock producers are only supposed to be <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14tZi0VArhDfrbZi3LVXFV1eApoYxq7xL/view?usp=sharing">reimbursed</a> for culling animals when they use methods that are <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f13ca3e0d7b7a5d4bf7abc8/t/6521f519b3c33a33cd5375e2/1696724249445/04.28.2020+AVMA+Depopulation+Statement+Comment.pdf">AVMA-approved</a>.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">A vision for animal rights 3.0</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the meat industry, this alliance with the veterinary profession has paid off abundantly. The next wave of animal activism, animal rights 3.0, will need to take a page from their playbook and work to turn animal professionals — including veterinarians and state and federal agriculture officials — against the systems that have enlisted them into profit-driven animal cruelty.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many veterinarians go into the profession because they love animals. Yet in veterinary school, we’re often taught that animal rights is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A5aJctU_7wCw7OH3dtyEYIdYbDhpV77A/view?usp=sharing">threat</a> to our profession, that <a href="https://news.wsu.edu/news/2002/10/04/veterinarians-strongly-disagree-with-animal-rights-activists/">limiting animal experimentation</a> would harm medical progress, and that factory farming is necessary to feed the world. Like the winged monkeys in <em>The Wizard of Oz </em>doing the bidding of the Wicked Witch of the West, veterinarians <a href="https://cdqap.org/animal-rights-activists-increasingly-aggressive-dangerous/">obediently recite</a> anti-animal rights narratives, serving the interests of multibillion-dollar conglomerates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.avma.org/resources-tools/reports-statistics/market-research-statistics-avma-membership">vast majority</a> of US veterinarians working today treat companion animals — like cats and dogs — not animals raised for food, and I’ve often observed that rather than rock the boat, they tend to <a href="https://www.avma.org/javma-news/2021-09-15/hod-recommends-depopulation-policy-sent-expert-panel-further-consideration">defer</a> to their livestock industry colleagues’ expertise about the appropriate treatment of farm animals. The small percentage of veterinarians who do work in animal agriculture and industry are <a href="https://www.avma.org/about/state-and-allied-groups">overrepresented</a> in the AVMA’s decision-making bodies, through greater access and opportunities for positions on the AVMA’s various committees and advisory panels, while veterinarians who vocally oppose industry practices, as I have, are <a href="https://theintercept.com/2020/10/10/new-documents-reveal-how-the-animal-agriculture-industry-surveils-and-punishes-critics/">silenced</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal rights 2.0, with its focus on boycott and abstinence from systems that it finds reprehensible, has missed an opportunity to develop activists within the professional community that’s perhaps best positioned to challenge corporate animal abuse. Even veterinarians who already support animal rights and oppose factory farming, when I voice my concerns with the AVMA, have told me countless times, “That’s why I am no longer a member.” That’s exactly how the industry likes it: pro-animal voices lacking the ability to comment on policies and guidelines, join committees, and hold positions of influence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal rights 3.0 will have to shed the fixation on personal purity that has prevented the movement from shaping policy and regulation. Animal advocates should have a seat at the table in rooms where decisions are made about how animals live and die. Veterinarians are deeply embedded in the USDA — the agency “hires the highest number of veterinarians of any other national organization in the world,” Pat Basu, former USDA chief public health veterinarian, told me in an email, making it a prime opportunity for vets who want to help farm animals.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Animal rights 3.0 will have to shed the fixation on personal purity that has prevented the movement from shaping policy and regulation</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those whose long-term career ambitions do not depend on the livestock industry have the unique opportunity to obtain positions of influence within the USDA, state agriculture departments, or the AVMA, work to rigorously enforce animal welfare laws that often go ignored, and publicly speak out if they’re prevented from doing their jobs. They can use their roles to question the ongoing denial of rights to animals and advocate for redirecting public funds away from animal agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We already have the building blocks for this: A nascent movement of veterinarians is fighting to change the profession’s priorities to align with the interests of animals instead of their corporate oppressors. More veterinarians, including myself, <a href="https://www.humaneslaughter.org/">are</a> <a href="https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/229/3/javma.229.3.350.xml">working</a> with animal rights activists to draw public attention to animal agriculture’s atrocities. We need more organizational capacity in animal rights to develop partnerships with professionals who work with animals, including not just the already converted, but also those who work in industries that exploit animals and are questioning the ethics of their roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latter phenomenon, sometimes known as “moral injury,” is <a href="https://www.nomv.org/2023/08/19/moral-injury-and-how-it-affects-veterinary-professionals/">well-known</a> in veterinary medicine, yet too often, veterinarians are trained to quiet the inner voice that tells them they’re participating in an unjust system. We can empower these people to follow their conscience and protect the most vulnerable among us. Eventually, we can build <a href="https://www.institutionalcourage.org/the-call-to-courage">institutional courage</a> in organizations like the AVMA — a concept coined by psychologist Jennifer Freyd for when institutions that have committed grievous harm apologize for wrongdoing, correct the damage caused, and put systems in place to protect victims and whistleblowers in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There will be backlash, as we’re already seeing today, with meat industry-led <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/14/24069722/political-ban-cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-plant-based-labeling-laws">state bans</a> on cell-cultivated meat and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">legislation</a> challenging animal welfare laws. We have to prepare ourselves for a brutal fight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can draw inspiration from the animal activists of the 19th century, who achieved so much with far less wealth and resources than we have today, and understood the connection between all forms of social injustice. But they were unprepared for the arrival of a new economic order that would transform the American food environment and trade away the environment, public health, and animal welfare for abundant cheap meat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A century later, animal rights 2.0 awakened the public to the horrors of factory farming, but it emerged at a time when it was not yet clear how unlevel the playing field was between vegan advocates and their meat industry opponents. The next wave of animal activism will need to integrate these lessons from the past, building a movement that bridges the divide between activists, veterinarians, and other professionals, and empowers them to confront the systems that lead humanity to inflict large-scale atrocities on the animals with whom we share this planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s one of those facts of the world that most people know but don’t really want to <em>know</em>: Billions of animals on factory farms live their lives in gruesome and torturous conditions so that our eggs and meat are a bit cheaper. Virtually <a href="https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/we-love-animals-why-do-we-torture">no one really approves of it</a>, but almost everyone participates in it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want to change that, what should you do about it?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I was in college, activists for animals had some passionate disagreements about which approach to take. A lot of them favored leafleting — handing out flyers with grotesque pictures of the horrifying conditions on factory farms, with the idea of shocking people into change. Others favored protests in restaurants and grocery stores, or daring rescues of dying animals from confinement. Some people hoped we could obviate meat altogether with plant-based or lab-grown alternatives, while others wanted to work towards gradual legislative change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consider lobbying to make a factory farm slightly more humane, even as it still subjects animals to awful conditions. Many animal rights activists feel like that amounts to complicity in the abuses that even supposedly more humane farms would go on to perpetuate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Effective altruists, by contrast, tended to jump at such opportunities — after all, 10 percent better conditions for animals, while hardly perfect, is still better. Many sanctuaries for rescued farm animals were <a href="https://www.upc-online.org/thinking/230801_are_farmed_animal_sanctuaries_at_risk.html">bitter about</a> effective animal advocates’ disinterest in funding them; effective animal advocates, in turn, would grimly observe that sanctuaries simply don’t have that many animals in them, compared to the number in factory farms. It was a matter of numbers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was also a difference in ethos. Faced with an atrocity, some people are <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/364284">drawn to splash themselves</a> with blood and march down the street, trying to make passersby realize the magnitude of the horrors they’re complicit in. Other people are inclined to whip out some spreadsheets. These two groups often end up suspicious of each other, each exasperated to have allies who refuse to do what it takes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One could write an entire book about the culture clashes as effective altruism-oriented giving entered the animal advocacy space. Effective altruists were also making a splash in other areas, like global health and development or biosecurity or AI, but those were all areas where a lot of money was already being spent from many sources. Farmed animal advocacy, by contrast, was not.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Effective animal advocates rapidly became a <a href="https://johnsoncenter.org/blog/one-health-and-animal-protection-philanthropy-a-growing-sub-sector/">huge source of spending in the space</a>, and their philosophy of how to do good became prominent. That understandably led to frustration from people with other theories of how to do good, theories they’d often spent decades working on with very little funding.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But ultimately almost everyone involved should agree the effective animal advocacy movement should be evaluated not by how they made humans feel, but by how their work impacted animals.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Stronger together</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A decade on, the philosophy of incremental and numbers-oriented welfare work has gotten a lot done.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/how-the-open-wing-alliance-has-helped-free-hundreds-of-millions-of-chickens-from-cages/">recent blog post</a> published by the Open Philanthropy Project, which has funded effective animal advocacy work, lays out how they did it. The <a href="https://openwingalliance.org/">Open Wing Alliance</a>, a coalition of animal advocacy organizations, zeroed in on corporations as a good target for pressure to improve conditions. Since these corporations tend to sell eggs to consumers, they care about their reputation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Open Wing Alliance would effectively offer them a deal: commit to going cage-free, <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/how-the-open-wing-alliance-has-helped-free-hundreds-of-millions-of-chickens-from-cages/">or else</a>: “Protesters will mobilize online and on the ground; they’ll show up in chicken costumes at corporate headquarters and franchise locations. Public ads and social media shame campaigns will further drive negative press. The OWA … will do its best to make [the target’s] brand synonymous with animal cruelty if they refuse to make necessary welfare improvements.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an important way, this represents a synthesis of the two threads of the animal advocacy movement that I encountered back when I was a college student: the suit-wearing lobbying types get the meetings with corporations, and make demands carefully chosen based on rigorous analysis of which asks do the most for animals. But the corporations’ reason to go along is that should they refuse, they will face protesters willing to put their bodies on the line for animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s proven to be a very powerful tactic. Hundreds of pledges have been made, and broadly, they’ve been kept. Hundreds of millions of chickens live lives that are still pretty horrifying, but still significantly better than they’d otherwise have been — <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1he5hQ_2VmLKUdsBqEPU5yeneOTCbGoAs/view">one estimate concluded</a> that compared to a hen raised in a cage, each hen raised cage-free will spend 275 fewer hours in “disabling pain,” and thousands of hours less time in lower levels of pain. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No one is declaring victory, but it seems like the negotiation-and-threat-of-protests strategy is a highly cost-effective way to improve conditions for animals.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The road ahead</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, it’s impossible to imagine fully addressing the horrors of factory farming with this approach — or with any single approach. Corporations will change their policies if it’s relatively inexpensive to do so, but it’s hard to imagine them adopting the much more expensive changes that would be necessary to give animals intensively raised on factory farms good lives. And plenty of animal advocates wouldn’t be happy even if you did pull that off; they’d like us to stop raising billions of animals in captivity to kill and eat, not just to be nicer about doing so. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the most unpleasant feature of factory farming is that, unlike nearly all of the world’s problems, so far it has gotten worse as the world has gotten richer. As more and more people enter the global middle class and can afford cheap meat, it creates incentives for more companies to horrendously mistreat animals. For all the progress I’ve discussed, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">more animals in the US</a> are factory farmed now than when I was in college.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a problem as big as this one, you can accomplish a ton and still have an unfathomable distance to go.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when I look at the state of animal advocacy in 2024, I’m optimistic. Since a decade ago, there’s been a serious maturation of the field. It has integrated the many varying perspectives on what advocates are trying to achieve, and somewhat grown past the frictions of very different people trying to work together toward a common goal. And people have accomplished real and worthy things, and learned a lot about what works.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stakes remain enormous and the situation remains stomach-churningly terrible, but many of the arguments I remember having in college are ones that the movement has now substantially moved past. Disruptive protests or polished advocacy? Why not one as a strategy to produce the other, like how labor unions do it? Is it worth advocating for incremental change? Looks like, yes, it definitely is. Do people from different subcultures and with different perspectives really care about animals, despite all the mutual distrust? Looks like, yes, they do!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, I’ve seen many other advocacy groups run aground on such differences. It’s worth occasionally taking a step back to be impressed with the achievements of animal advocates — and, if you work on any other high-stakes depressingly entrenched ill in our world, to learn from them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a bid to undercut Vice President Kamala Harris’s newly announced running mate, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/365416/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-vice-president-democrats-left" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/politics/365416/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vp-vice-president-democrats-left">Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz,</a> Republicans are mounting attacks on his military record. The charges, which a closer look suggests are misleading or exaggerated, are a notable escalation against the Democratic ticket by the Trump campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The attacks began in earnest on August 7, when Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, President Donald Trump’s running mate, sought to tout his own military experience compared to Walz’s. Prior to running for Congress, Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard, while Vance served for four years in the Marine Corps. Neither has seen combat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America, asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I’m very proud of that service,” Vance said. “When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Vance’s sweeping statement contains some key omissions. For instance, Walz <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-walz-military-record/#">retired in 2005</a>, two months before his unit received formal notice it would be sent to Iraq. Another <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/08/harris-walz-military-credentials-00173236#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWalz%20attained%20the%20rank%20of,to%20the%20Minneapolis%20Star%20Tribune.">Republican attack on Walz’s service</a> — that he <a href="https://x.com/GOP/status/1821595739757125876">misrepresented himself</a> as a retired command sergeant major — is also more complicated: While he held that rank at one point, his rank was changed after retirement because he <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/10/03/tim-walz-national-guard-career-minnesota-governor-race">did not complete the required coursework</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/republicans-vance-start-tearing-walz-going-military-record-rcna165564">another claim by Republicans</a> is that Walz misrepresented his service by implying in a past statement that he once served in a combat zone. In that case, the language he used appears to have been imprecise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is precedent for these types of attacks: Republicans appear to be resorting to the same “swift-boating” tactics that they once levied against former Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. A reference to the small speedboats used in the Vietnam War where Kerry served, the campaign sought to impugn his character by casting doubt on his account of military service in Vietnam.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, the architect of that campaign against Kerry was <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/swift-boat-walz/">Chris LaCivita — now a prominent staffer</a> on former President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz has faced questions about his military service before, including when he ran for Minnesota governor in 2018. And in that instance — and this one — he’s had several veterans defend him as well. Joseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the National Guard, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/walzs-24-years-in-national-guard-get-renewed-scrutiny-from-gop-opponent-who-didnt-serve/600216280">told the Minnesota Star Tribune in 2022</a>, “He was a great soldier. When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Harris campaign for its part has responded by stressing Walz’s tenure and policy record. “After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform,” the Harris campaign told Vox in a statement. The campaign also pointed to Walz’s time as a ranking member on the House Veteran Affairs Committee and his support for funding and mental health resources for the military.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The claims, and the information we know, briefly explained&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The claims that Republicans have made about Walz focus on three issues: his decision to retire from the Army National Guard in 2005, his rank upon retirement, and a comment he made about carrying weapons “in war.” Here’s what we know about each of them. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Claim 1: </strong>Walz retired from the Army National Guard to avoid serving in Iraq.</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know: </strong>Notably, Walz retired in <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-walz-military-record/#">May 2005</a>, two months prior to his unit receiving an official deployment order to Iraq. He stated in 2009 that <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/afc2001001.69125/#item-service_history">his reasons for retiring</a> were to pursue a run for the House of Representatives, which he won the following year, and to avoid conflicts under the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in certain political activities. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz filed for his run for office before the National Guard had notified his unit of the possibility of a deployment to Iraq. It’s unclear if, at the time, he already knew that a deployment could be a possibility.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is a more detailed timeline of how this all unfolded.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>February 10, 2005</strong>: <a href="https://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/112/25038731112/25038731112.pdf">Walz files paperwork</a> with the Federal Election Commission declaring his candidacy for the House seat in Minnesota’s First Congressional District.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>March 17, 2005:</strong> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050420005951/http://www.timwalz.org/print.php?pr=1">The National Guard informs members</a> of the possibility of deployment to Iraq within the next two years. The public affairs office notes that <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-walz-military-record/#">2,000 members</a> could be sent from the Minnesota National Guard, which could include part of, or the entirety of, Walz’s battalion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>March 20, 2005</strong>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050420004957/http://www.timwalz.org/pr.php?pr=1">Walz issues a statement</a> responding to the National Guard notice, saying he intends to continue to serve, and to continue his run for Congress.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,” he said. “As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>May 16, 2005</strong>: Walz retires from the National Guard, according to a comment the Minnesota Army National Guard <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-walz-military-record/">provided CBS News.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>July 14, 2005</strong>: Walz’s battalion receives an alert order for mobilization to Iraq.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>March 2006: </strong>Walz’s unit is <a href="https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/573070/guard-unit-recognized-for-record-deployment/">deployed to Iraq</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Claim 2: </strong>The<strong> </strong>Harris-Walz campaign misrepresented his title by stating that he’s a “retired Command Sergeant Major.”</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-walz-military-record/">On the Harris campaign website</a> and a Minnesota government website, Walz had been listed as a “retired Command Sergeant Major,” according to CBS News.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans have argued that this is an inaccurate description of his title. That phrase has now been <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/08/harris-walz-military-credentials-00173236">changed on the Harris campaign website</a> to note that this title was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240808091058/https://kamalaharris.com/meet-governor-tim-walz/">the highest rank he earned</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know: </strong>Walz did, in fact, attain the position of Command Sergeant Major. However, after he retired, his title was changed to Master Sergeant, because <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tim-walz-military-record/">he did not finish the coursework required</a> to retire under the promoted title.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, it’s accurate to say that he was once a Command Sergeant Major, but not that he was a “retired Command Sergeant Major.”&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Claim 3: </strong>Walz misrepresented his involvement in combat in a speech about gun control.&nbsp;</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,” Walz said in remarks <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/02/20/in-about-face-walz-backs-assault-weapons-ban-for-minnesota">about an assault weapons ban in 2018.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gov. <a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_Walz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Tim_Walz</a>: I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt. I’ve been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence.

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vance argues that Walz’s statements imply that he was in combat when he wasn’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know: </strong>Walz was deployed as part of the National Guard to Vicenza, Italy, in August 2003 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom <a href="https://apnews.com/article/walz-national-guard-military-ae43d684bf1319e535f9f620552155d7#:~:text=Walz%20didn't%20serve%20in%20a%20combat%20zone&amp;text=According%20to%20the%20Nebraska%20Army,before%20graduating%20from%20high%20school.">but was not in a combat zone</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The phrasing of the statement in his gun control remarks, suggesting that he carried the weapons “in war,” was imprecise. While technically correct given the operation he was part of, it appears to suggest an experience he didn’t have. <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2018/10/03/tim-walz-national-guard-career-minnesota-governor-race">Walz has openly acknowledged in other interviews</a> that he hadn’t seen combat while deployed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Harris campaign has stressed Walz’s training with firearms in response. “In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,” the Harris campaign told Vox in a statement. “Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American&#8217;s service to this country — in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It&#8217;s the American way.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During every Olympic Games, lesser-known professional athletes are catapulted into household names overnight. Typically, they have to win medals. Other times, their personalities are enough to build their own fandoms. Heading into this summer’s Olympics in Paris, Noah Lyles expects to be recognized for both.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you don’t follow track and field, you may not be familiar with Lyles — although his name could soon become inescapable. Already, the new Netflix docuseries <em>Sprint</em>, set around the <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/olympics/news/track-and-field-world-championships-results-2023">2023 World Athletics Championships</a> in Budapest, has shone a bigger spotlight on him. The six-part series follows track and field’s brightest stars in the 100- and 200-meter sprints, including the fastest woman on Earth, Sha’Carri Richardson; Jamaican gold medalist Shericka Jackson; and British record-holder in the 100 and 200 meters, Zharnel Hughes. Despite this star power, the series’s main attraction has been Lyles, whose ambitions to outrun retired legend Usain Bolt have ruffled <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/us-sports-news-olympics-news-track-and-field-news-not-likable-at-all-noah-lyles-receives-heavy-criticism-from-twitters-track-field-community-for-netflixs-sprint-documentary/">some feathers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of Lyles’s soundbites in <em>Sprint</em> have been <a href="https://x.com/BadgyalTerryG/status/1811176867061260790">perceived</a> by <a href="https://x.com/willthefred/status/1811185176766038069">viewers</a> as <a href="https://x.com/pernillatweets1/status/1809892070334570956">arrogant</a>. In one scene, he says that to be a successful athlete, “you have to have the mindset of a God.” “I’m a true believer in that the moment isn’t bigger than me, the moment was made for me,” he says in another. Compare this attitude to Shericka Jackson’s. When asked by someone off-camera about claims that she’s the best in the sport, she refused to comment. Meanwhile, others seem confused about Lyles’s claim to “the fastest man in the world” title while Bolt is still living. Lyles maintained this stance at an Olympics news conference on July 26 after a Team USA video of the sprinter introducing himself as such went viral and drew more backlash. Lyles joked, “It’s always going to me” before stating that the title goes to “the Olympic champion and the world champion, which I am one of. And soon to be another one of.”<strong> </strong>Much like <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/shacarri-richardson-august-2024-digital-cover-interview" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vogue.com/article/shacarri-richardson-august-2024-digital-cover-interview">Richardson</a>, his bravado, personal style, and penchant for trash-talking has given Americans someone to place their bets on at the upcoming Olympics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Currently, Lyles holds the title of the fastest man in the world after winning the 100 and 200 meters — also known as the sprint double — at last year’s World Championships. (He ran the 100 meter in 9.83 seconds and the 200 meter in 19.52.) Altogether, he holds six world titles. He also earned the bronze medal in the 200 meter at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, a disappointing result that he says inspired his lofty goals at this year’s games. Not only does he want to beat Bolt’s record times, he plans to take home four gold medals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, Lyles has already <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/40726446/noah-lyles-wins-gold-us-100m-hair-breadth">nabbed a gold medal</a> during the 100 meter sprint on August 4, where he won first place by 0.005 seconds. Most recently, though, he felt short of his goal, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/olympics/story/2024-08-08/noah-lyles-does-not-win-paris-200-meters">taking home the bronze</a> during the 200 meter on August 8. He was also expected to compete in the finals for the men’s 4&#215;100 meter relay and possibly the 4&#215;400 relay, giving him a shot at two more golds. However, following the 200 meter, Lyles was wheeled off the sidelines. Then USA Track &amp; Field, the governing body for the sport, announced that he had <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/noah-lyles-olympics-200m-final-medals-b2593546.html">tested positive for Covid-19</a> prior to competing in the race, which could incite another wave of backlash for the athlete. However, Scientific American <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/olympic-athletes-allowed-to-compete-while-covid-positive/">reported</a> this week that several Olympians have tested positive but are still being allowed to compete. While Lyles’s Olympic quest has come to an end this year, he at least left the Games having achieved another career goal — having everyone talk about him.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Lyles may have his critics, but it’s all part of his mythmaking&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When we think of celebrity athletes whose fame extends beyond their sport, sprinters aren’t exactly the first people to come to mind. While Bolt has practically become synonymous with running, it’s fair to say the sport doesn’t offer its athletes the same level of visibility that the NBA, for example, offers even its most unassuming players. For instance, it took a <a href="https://www.vox.com/22565419/shacarri-richardson-olympics-marijuana-ban-war-on-drugs">drug-test scandal</a> — coming up positive for marijuana, not performance-enhancing drugs — and her subsequent suspension from the Tokyo Olympics for Richardson to become a national talking point and a currently beloved underdog.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lyles wants this to change. “You have all these other athletes as stars, rockstars, popular wherever they go,” he says in the first episode of <em>Sprint</em>. “Track and field needs to be the same.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 26-year-old has certainly been doing his part to bring attention to the sport, or maybe just to himself. While he doesn’t represent the most head-turning style in track and field right now — that may belong to Richardson with her occasionally flame-colored hair, numerous tattoos, and Flo Jo-esque acrylics — he frequently shows up to meets in snazzy, designer looks, like F1 champion Lewis Hamilton or one of a handful of NBA stars. Also in the spirit of ’80s icon Florence Griffith Joyner, he even enjoys a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nbcolympics/video/7344869517991922990">flashy manicure</a>. His accomplishments, thus far, have also gotten him a few magazine covers, most recently <a href="https://time.com/6991825/noah-lyles-olympics-2024-interview/">Time</a>, and an extremely lucrative contract for a track star with Adidas.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On social media, he delivers the same high-quality, fashion-forward content of a major influencer. (In <em>Sprint</em>, he refers to himself as an “artistic director.”) On his Instagram (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/nojo18/?hl=en">@nojo18</a>), where he’s approaching a million followers, you’re just as likely to see high-res photos of his pre-meet fits, posts with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8k6QGHI7qq/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">Snoop Dogg</a>, and wardrobe selections inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8yKXDnRYer/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">his favorite anime</a> as you are content related to track. He also posts playful videos with his girlfriend, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9LDOhMvteN/?hl=en">fellow runner Junelle Bromfield</a>, the pair seeming to be a power couple in the making.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On his way to becoming America’s most beloved track star, though, Lyles has already rubbed some sports fans the wrong way. In an interview following his World Championship wins last year, he questioned why NBA Finals winners are referred to as “world champions.” “World champions of what?” he asked at a post-meet conference.“The United States?” Soon came a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/29/sport/noah-lyles-nba-backlash-spt-intl/index.html">pile of responses</a> from NBA players, including Kevin Durant, Aaron Gordon, and Devin Booker denouncing his comments. Drake, a supporter of the Toronto Raptors, even chimed in, poking fun at Lyles. Others, like Ghanaian sports journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/garyalsmith/status/1696087026154541245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1696087026154541245%7Ctwgr%5E95a150cf499700a49eda9372113c58a1dfff9e17%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2023%2F08%2F28%2F1196396026%2Fnoah-lyles-nba-world-champions-basketball-drake-kevin-durant">Gary Al-Smith</a>, said Lyles was simply observing a larger problem of American exceptionalism in basketball.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ironically, Lyles has been accused of displaying the same superior, <a href="https://x.com/wiiissssss/status/1810777524630397169">culturally American</a> attitude in his own sport. On the fourth episode of <em>Sprint</em>, Lyles discussed the backlash he received after he posted his predicted times in the 100 meter and 200 meter at last year’s World Championships on Instagram, which he ultimately fell short of, despite taking home the gold. “What the heck does me saying my goal have to do with you?” he asks in a talking-head interview. It’s a good question, considering that it’s every athlete’s goal to perform at their best and destroy their opponents, whether or not they vocalize it as much as Lyles does. Fans’ negative responses to this sort of behavior have also confused Richardson, who says in the docuseries that there should be “more trash-talking” in the sport.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This poor reception online can at least be partially explained by a heated rivalry between American and Jamaican sprinters that intensified at the<a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1269260-olympic-track-2012-breaking-down-team-usas-rivalry-with-jamaican-sprinters"> 2008 Beijing Olympics</a> where Bolt won the gold in the 100 meter and 200 meter, while achieving record times in both sprints. Jamaican track stars Shelly Ann-Frazer and Veronica Campbell-Brown also won the 100 meter and 200 meter, respectively. More than any athlete, though, Bolt has become a national symbol and icon in Jamaica, where track and field is the dominant sport. Announcing your plans to overthrow him, as Lyles has done, expectedly has some repercussions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>All eyes are on Lyles at the Paris Olympics&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the US claims both the fastest man and woman in the world right now, one can assume an even larger number of American viewers will be tuned in to track this year, and there’s a lot at stake for Lyles’s reputation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, the Olympics have been fraught territory for the runner. In 2020, fans&nbsp;witnessed the emotional toll that training for and competing at the Olympics has had on Lyles, and how he handles disappointment when he’s fallen short of his goals.&nbsp;After landing in third place in the 200 meter in Tokyo, Lyles broke down during a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/08/04/noah-lyles-bronze-olympics-depression/">post-meet interview</a> with the Washington Post. Tears started to fall when talking about his brother, Josephus Lyles, another professional sprinter, who failed to qualify for the Olympics that year. He spoke&nbsp;about his mental health and his journey with antidepressants leading up to the Olympics, as well as his experience marching alongside his brother in 2020’s Black Lives Matter protests, and the pressure he feels as a Black American athlete and a Black American man.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I knew there were a lot of people out there like me who were too scared to say something or start that journey,” he said. “I wanted them to know if you guys see me in a big light, I want you to know that it’s okay not to feel good and you can go out and talk to somebody … This is a serious issue.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2158934967_fdcc65.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Noah Lyles, pictured from below, wears a red track suit and a gold medal around his neck, stands beside a replica of the Eiffel tower." title="Noah Lyles, pictured from below, wears a red track suit and a gold medal around his neck, stands beside a replica of the Eiffel tower." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Noah Lyles celebrates with the gold medal after winning the men’s 100-meter final on day three of the 2024 US Olympic Team trials Track &amp; Field at Hayward Field on June 23, 2024, in Eugene, Oregon. | Patrick Smith/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Patrick Smith/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, following a double-sprint win at the World Championships, Lyles is displaying more confidence than ever. During a recent appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZRVEX2OG10"><em>The Tonight Show</em></a>, Lyles took the opportunity to tell the country what he planned to achieve in Paris. For one thing, he wants to beat Bolt, who holds the top two times in the 100-meter dash at 9.63 and 9.69 seconds. But he also wants to take home four gold medals. “It’s not just good enough to be faster than that,” Lyles told Fallon. “You also have to have the medals to go with it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to taking home the gold in the 100 and 200 meter, Lyles wants to win in the 4&#215;100&nbsp;and 4&#215;400 meter relays. It wouldn’t be the first time an American sprinter nabbed four gold medals at one Olympics. For instance, Jesse Owens, Alvin Kraenzlein, and Carl Lewis have each won four. Their wins included the long jump, however; Lyles would be making history for those four sprints. Beyond any potential medals, the energy surrounding him and Richardson feels like a new era for American track stars, one defined by attitude and swagger. If Lyles can impress the world with his personality, he’ll at least have achieved half of his goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, August 8, 4:25 pm ET: </strong>This story was originally published on July 23 and has been updated to include Lyles’s results and positive Covid test at the Paris Olympics.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2024 was supposed to be the year MDMA, perhaps better known as “ecstasy” or “molly,” got its big break.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until this summer, it was on track to rise out of the underground and into mainstream mental health care. Amid a lack of novel treatments for PTSD and staggering rates of veteran suicide, results from late-stage clinical trials seemed promising and advocates were hopeful the FDA would approve the drug for medical use.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, an FDA advisory panel raised red flags about trial methodology, bias, and potential data suppression, which could imperil the future of medicinal MDMA. Now, the psychedelic drug is at a make-or-break point, with the FDA scheduled to make an announcement this month on whether it is ready to move forward as a PTSD treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a three-part series, <em><a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast">Today, Explained</a></em>’s Haleema Shah reports on the promise and precarity of MDMA. Starting with the rogue chemist and therapists in the 1980s who believed it could change psychotherapy, the series traces the decades-long effort to make a dance-floor drug medicinal, journeying through the war on drugs, the rave era, and the psychedelic renaissance to explain how a once-maligned drug became an emblem of healing — and how, no matter what the FDA decides, therapy will never be the same.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At last, the B-boys of summer — and B-girls — are here, and they’re bringing their unique blend of dancing, gymnastics, and hip-hop culture to Paris. On August 9, breaking — don’t call it breakdancing — makes its hotly anticipated Olympics debut in the sport’s highest-profile moment to date.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The entrance of breaking into the Olympics is a huge milestone for a sport and a dance style that has fought long and hard for social acceptance. After all, you don’t get to be an Olympic athlete without approaching a mindblowing level of physical stamina and ability. And when you match that with the level of agility required of great dancers, plus the heady competitiveness of a sport that was honed through street battles, you have the recipe for a truly unique, groundbreaking Olympic sport — and the mainstreaming of this American-born street dance on a whole new global level.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is breaking?</strong></h2>
<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://volume.vox-cdn.com/embed/7acd1fab6?player_type=youtube&#038;loop=1&#038;placement=article&#038;tracking=article:rss" allowfullscreen frameborder="0" allow=""></iframe></div>
<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand breaking, you have to understand the roots of hip-hop culture. On the sidewalks and back yards of the Bronx, where hip-hop was born in the late ’60s and ’70s, there were <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2017/6/20/15836346/how-bronx-created-breaking-breakdancing">four main streams</a>, or elements, of hip-hop artistry: DJ-ing, emceeing, graffiti art, and breaking. All of them evolved into cornerstones of contemporary mainstream culture. DJing is everywhere, from your average wedding to the megastars who play clubs and arenas, and has evolved further into producers who develop beats and sounds. Emceeing became more commonly known as rapping, which has evolved further into a varied and rich poetic language. Graffiti influenced modern art and pop aesthetics for decades and influenced “guerilla” art and other subversive underground art movements. It’s now a regular installation in museums and galleries and a crucial element of public art in urban areas. And breaking, growing alongside other related but individual street dance styles, became one of the most famous and popular dance forms around. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the decades, breaking and other street dance styles have benefited from popular dance media like the <em>Step Up</em> franchise, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/2/16/16915672/what-is-kpop-history-explained">K-pop</a> and other popular Asian dance groups, and shows like <a href="https://www.vox.com/22630249/one-good-thing-street-dance-of-china-wang-yibo"><em>Street Dance of China</em></a>. Simultaneously, the rise of high-profile international street dance circuit competitions like Juste Debout and Red Bull’s annual <a href="https://www.redbull.com/us-en/event-series/bc-one">BC One challenge</a> have sent breaking and its associated culture on an ascendant trajectory that shows no signs of stopping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Breaking is a unique blend of athleticism and artistry</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a B-boy or B-girl wants to be taken seriously as a breaker, they have to show not only that they can do big athletic movements, but that they can also execute precise “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rSr93kCt2U">toprock</a>,” the basic steps for opening and transitioning a dance into the more athletic movements — because the beat is still essential to the performance. In a toprock battle, like the one shown below, bigger movements don’t always win out over controlled musicality.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="NANOX vs ALLEF - toprock | stance x PINK CITY WORLD BATTLE 2022" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8g8Pj9bUNo?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outside of a special toprock competition like this one, the purpose of toprock is to help the dancer get smoothly to the floor, where the bigger, more gymnastic moves usually happen. But that wasn’t always the case; in a <a href="https://preciousgemsofknowledge79.blogspot.com/2020/01/interview-with-dj-ez-mike-grandmaster.html">2020 interview</a>, OG hip-hop pioneer DJ EZ Mike explained that breaking evolved over time into the big movements it’s known for today:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">The dance changed as the years went on. We didn’t do windmills on the floor because we didn’t dirty our clothes. We dressed very nice. So it had a lot to do with hand movements, facial gestures and footwork. I guess they call it Up-Rocking today.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As dancers got more comfortable getting down and dirty, the form of breaking expanded. In this classic breaking footage from 1984, the street dance crew Sidewalk Breakers demonstrate a variety of moves that show how complex footwork flows to complex floor work:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="SIDEWALK BREAKERS PART 1 1984" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lTge51Sa4Ck?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s where the most well-known breaking moves come from — like the “Thomas Flair,” a famous gymnast move that evolved into an even more famous old-school breaking move where a dancer whirls around while balancing on one or two hands…</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/breaking-flare.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">…or the “Windmill,” which is essentially the same thing upside down, with the dancer balancing on their elbows and shoulders and occasionally just their head.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/breaking-windmill.gif?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.821989528796,100,52.356020942408" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Obviously some of these big “power moves” are extremely dangerous, which is one reason why breaking has fought for decades to overcome what was initially a negative reputation. Part of this was due to the overall stigmatization of hip-hop culture by the mainstream, and the racist stereotype that it was inherently tied to gang participation. In fact, the four “elements” of hip-hop were <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1468-2427.12087">first brought together</a> as a way for gangs in the Bronx to unify and interact peacefully in block parties and other collective forms of community-building. They gave rise to dance crews, which are still a staple of street dance culture. Street dance is inherently both collective and competitive, so you’re always strongest when you’re part of a strong team of dancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another reason for breaking’s negative public perception was due to the media-coined moniker “breakdancing” itself (which arose thanks to a flub from <a href="https://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/the_origins_of_breaking_with_its_biggest_namecrazylegs/">the manager</a> of the legendary Rock Steady crew during an interview), and the danger and risk of injury it implied. Within the culture, the name “breaking” actually came from participants responding to breaks in the music — that is, filling the parts we now think of as “dance breaks” with, what else? Dancing. Originally, breaking was purely for fun, improvised during block parties. This led to the “<a href="https://www.redbull.com/us-en/the-importance-of-the-cypher">cypher</a>,” or dance groups in which the participants form a circle — an informal stage — and take turns dancing for one another. Eventually, the cypher spawned a more structured form of competition — the “battle” — that still dominates street dance culture.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As we can see from the first video above, the battle format is usually pretty simple. Two competitors improvise, or “freestyle,” dance moves to songs chosen on the spot by the DJ and administered by an emcee. They usually compete in two rounds, after which the judges declare the winner. The judges are nearly always on stage or next to the stage with the competitors, and in most settings they vote in the most informal way possible — by deciding then and there, pointing at whoever won.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a case where the judges can’t decide, they’ll form an “X” with their hands, indicating that the dancers need to perform one more round. In some cases, “one more round” can turn into multiple rounds and become a test of stamina. This is a big deal for breakers, who are known less for their stamina over long battles than for their huge bursts of physical activity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are, of course, variants of one-on-one battles, like two-on-two battles, or team battles. The most famous team battle is probably the “7 to Smoke,” a ruthless battle format in which contestants who win one round keep battling other competitors in succession until they lose and the new winner takes over battling. This continues either until 25 minutes have elapsed overall, with the winner being the person who’s won the most rounds, or until one person has managed to win seven rounds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These are the basics of breaking. But of course, for the Olympics, things are a little more complicated.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What you can expect at the Olympics</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the 2010s, an Olympics dance lobby known as the World DanceSport Federation <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/02/09/break-dancing-olympic-sport-paris-2024/">worked hard</a> to raise awareness of breaking as a dance style and advocate for its entrance into the Olympics. (They adopted breaking as their main cause after failing to get ballroom dancing accepted into the games — a big pivot, but one that paid off.)&nbsp; In 2016, they scored big when breaking made its debut in the 2018 Youth Olympic Games. It was widely seen as a precursor to the Olympics stage, and the official Olympics website <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/breakings-debut-at-the-buenos-aires-2018-yog">hailed</a> the games as showcasing breaking as “a truly global sport.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might expect the Olympics to completely change the way that breaking battles are conducted, but surprisingly, they’ve only <a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/everything-you-need-know-about-breakings-olympic-debut">slightly tweaked</a> the basic battle concept. At Paris, we’ll see 16 men and 17 women go through essentially two major rounds of competition. (Because the women’s competition has an odd number of participants, the two lowest-seeded women contestants will first have their own one-off round to choose which will join the rest of the competition.)</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP9484447002" width="100%"></iframe>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first round for both men and women will be an all-encompassing round robin battle with contestants randomly divided into four groups of four.&nbsp;Each competitor will then battle against the other three in a two-round battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After they’ve all battled against one another, each group’s two highest-scoring contestants will advance to the next three rounds of competition, where they’ll be weeded out in one-on-one battles of three rounds each. The last breaker standing — or windmilling — gets the gold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The format is only slightly different from standard battles, and the most important element&nbsp;— improvisation — remains. No pre-rehearsed routines here; the breakers will still be showing off their ability to adapt to songs they haven’t prepared for in advance. The judging will necessarily be more formal. Judges will vote after each round based on six criteria. As with ice skating, some factors carry more weight than others, but surprisingly, it’s not a “technical/artistic” split: technique, performativity, and creativity comprise 60 percent of the score; personality, variety, and musicality comprise 40 percent. (“Performativity” in this context refers to how cleanly moves are executed.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Contestants to keep your eye on include Afghani IOC Refugee team member <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bgirl_talash/">Manizha Talash</a>, who won hearts with her <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/8/4/afghanistans-first-female-olympic-breakdancer-i-want-my-big">inspiring story</a> of discovering and then rediscovering breaking across two continents. At 42, veteran Japanese dancer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ayumi.bodycarnival/">Fukushima Ayumi</a> faces a much younger crop of dancers, many of whom are still in their teens and just started dancing a few years ago. She could also face her own teammate, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gfc_ami/">Yuasa Ami</a>, with whom she’s had a fierce back-and-forth rivalry. She defeated Ami in the 2021 world championships; Ami then won the 2022 world prize, only for Ayumi to return with a vengeance in the 2024 Olympic Qualifier.</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the men’s side, Vancouver-based frontrunner Philip Kim, aka <a href="https://www.instagram.com/philkwizard/?hl=en">Phil Wizard</a>, has a knack for pulling off miracles — he <a href="https://www.redbull.com/us-en/theredbulletin/b-boy-phil-wizard-interview">decided</a> to enter a cypher competition in Los Angeles, vowing to quit college and pursue breaking full-time if he won. He did. His main competition? Probably Japan’s Nakarai Shigeyuki, aka <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bboyshigekix/">Shigekix</a>, known for big, crowd-thrilling dance moves. For a preview of how that showdown might play out, here they both are, facing off last year:&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As exciting and fresh as all of this is, these games and these contestants still have a lot to prove to skeptics and Olympic officials alike. “Dance is not a sport. It’s an art, no matter what the International Olympic Committee or <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em> judges try to tell you,” <a href="https://dbknews.com/2020/12/10/breakdancing-2024-olympics-breaking-dance/">opined</a> one columnist in 2022. “Including dance seems like a desperate reach for more viewership.”&nbsp;As Fortune recently <a href="https://fortune.com/europe/2024/08/04/breaking-breakdancing-new-york-streets-paris-2024-olympics-debut-future/">noted</a>, breaking has yet to be approved for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles — despite the city being a hotbed of street dance culture and a regular stop on battle competition circuits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If there’s anything we know about breakers, however, it’s that they know how to put on big, dramatic shows. The Olympics may indeed be experimenting to bring in more viewers, but this year’s breakers will make the gamble worth it — and hopefully leave them with plenty to look forward to in four more years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story was originally published by </em><a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/08082024/debby-drenched-southeast-climate-change-wetter-storms/"><em>Inside Climate News</em></a><em> and is reproduced here as part of the <a href="https://www.climatedesk.org/">Climate Desk</a> collaboration. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tropical Storm Debby, a plodding, waterlogged system that has already saturated four southeastern states, bears many characteristics of a warming planet, climate scientists say. It’s reminiscent of other catastrophic tropical cyclones that have battered the United States over the past eight years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Wednesday afternoon, the storm was drifting at 5 mph near the South Carolina coast, about the pace of a monarch butterfly. It is expected to pick up speed today as it heads through North Carolina, where a foot or more of rain could fall in the southeastern part of the state and 6 to 8 inches are anticipated in the central Piedmont.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency this week, warning residents on Wednesday to “be prepared for a deluge.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A warmer atmosphere holds more water; likewise, warmer temperatures accelerate evaporation. “There’s a lot of water in this system that’s just ready to come out,” North Carolina’s state climatologist, Kathie Dello, said. “We’re pulling more of that moisture into the air and essentially supercharging the atmosphere. Or, as I like to say, get a cup of coffee and pour in a few shots of espresso.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tropical Storm Debby has arrived in what is on track to be one of the top 10 warmest years on record in North Carolina. As recently as late June, 99 of the state’s 100 counties were experiencing drought conditions ranging from abnormally dry to severe, according to the State Climate Office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That pattern reversed in July, when several cities reported their wettest July on record.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Swings between wet and dry are something that we’re expecting with climate change,” Dello said. “The extremes become more extreme.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tropical Storm Debby is reminiscent of two historic hurricanes that hit North Carolina — Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018. Although both were Category 1 storms by the time they landed in the US, they caused disproportionate damage because they stalled over land and dumped historic amounts of rain — as much as 3 feet — in eastern North Carolina. Thousands of people were left homeless and damages totaled in the billions of dollars.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tropical storms and hurricanes are producing heavier rain over the US, an indicator of climate change, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xbxm8pZKEHo3IHe5PsIf5mB1Yblrk63vhKnTQSJVQmI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a study</a> published last month in the <em>Journal of Climate</em>, a publication of the American Meteorological Society.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">John Uehling co-authored the paper with Carl Schreck III, both of whom are scientists at the North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Uehling told Inside Climate News that Tropical Storm Debby is “a classic case of what we’ve seen a lot in recent years,” including with Hurricanes Harvey and Florence, “where we have a stalling storm near the coastline that basically dumps rain over the same areas for an extended and prolonged period of time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Using historical rainfall gauge data, Uehling and Schreck found that instances of heavy rain associated with tropical cyclones are becoming more frequent and extreme. Major hurricanes — those in categories 3 through 5 — show the largest increases in extreme rainfall.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The real impact that we’re seeing is where the worst events are getting significantly worse,” Uehling said, whereas, in general, “your more run-of-the-mill events are not increasing at nearly the same rate.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study’s findings could help local governments, planners, and residents prepare for these weather disasters to occur more frequently, Uehling said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That includes inland areas in particular, where the study found the highest increases in rainfall: Alabama and Mississippi through southern Appalachia, including the mountains of North Carolina. Flooding in higher elevations presents different threats — including mudslides and more challenging evacuations — than coastal areas. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Places that have not been used to dealing with these kinds of threats are going to have to start dealing with them more often,” Uehling said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s important that people keep in mind that our climate is changing, that these sort of events are occurring with more and more frequency, and that the impacts seem to be getting greater,” he said. “We have a duty as a society not only to mitigate against these changes, but to do what we can to prevent them from getting worse.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Debby <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2024/al04/al042024.update.08051056.shtml?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made landfall</a> Monday morning near Steinhatchee, Florida, in the state’s sparsely populated Big Bend region, so named for the way the peninsula meets the panhandle. The Category 1 storm forged a path similar to that of last year’s Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane that was the <a href="https://tropical.colostate.edu/Forecast/2023-11-pressrelease.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strongest</a> to strike this part of the state since 1896.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2165383492.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.740836125969,100,78.518327748063" alt="A person walks through a flooded street caused by the rain and storm surge from Tropical Storm Debby on Monday in Cedar Key, Florida." title="A person walks through a flooded street caused by the rain and storm surge from Tropical Storm Debby on Monday in Cedar Key, Florida." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A person walks through a flooded street caused by the rain and storm surge from Tropical Storm Debby on August 5, 2024, in Cedar Key, Florida. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images via Inside Climate News" data-portal-copyright="Joe Raedle/Getty Images via Inside Climate News" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Hundreds of thousands of Floridians lost power and Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 61 of the state’s 67 counties. More than 9,400 feet of what his administration characterized as flood protection devices were deployed at critical infrastructure sites such as schools, health care facilities, and roads and bridges. For the first time flood control barriers also were positioned around utility substations, to try to prevent more power outages, his <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/08/06/governor-desantis-issues-updates-on-debby-response-announces-activation-of-small-business-emergency-bridge-loan-to-support-local-impacted-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">administration said</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Florida officials feared more flooding later in the week, as water continued to flow south from the rain-soaked states of Georgia and the Carolinas. By Wednesday, the Florida Division of Emergency Management had pumped more than 104 million gallons of floodwater from communities across the state, the DeSantis administration said.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Places that have not been used to dealing with these kinds of threats are going to have to start dealing with them more often.” </p></blockquote></figure>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This could take anywhere from three to seven days,” said Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, of the duration of the flooding in the state. “This is going to be about a weeklong event that we’re going to be monitoring.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the worst flooding occurred about 200 miles from the Big Bend region in Sarasota, a beachy community south of Tampa. As much as 12 to 18 inches of rain pummeled the community as Debby’s outer bands swirled some 80 miles offshore. The totals constituted some of the highest rainfall amounts in the state, said Tony Hurt, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Ruskin, south of Tampa. Florida typically receives roughly 50 inches of rain annually.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least 500 Sarasota residents were rescued from flooded houses, according to the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sarasotapolicedept/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">police department</a>. To the north, in neighboring Manatee County, 186 residents were rescued, the <a href="https://www.mymanatee.org/news___events/what_s_new" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">local government</a> said. Officials characterized the rainfall as record-breaking.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Any kind of event like this you just try to be as prepared and stay as flexible as you can,” said Terry Chapman, minister at the South Trail Church of Christ in Sarasota. “We are thankful that it was not worse.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the church’s parishioners had friends and family members who were affected by the flooding, and the congregation was considering the best ways to offer help. One area that was especially hard-hit was east of Interstate 75, well away from the Gulf Coast.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Those are newer houses,” Chapman said. “Those are houses that were built within the last 20 years.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico powered a rapid intensification of Debby, a phenomenon that is becoming more common because of climate change. The warming climate also is leading to more water evaporation, producing more water vapor that can feed heavy downpours like those experienced with Debby, said James Marshall Shepherd, director of the Atmospheric Sciences Program at the University of Georgia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“For Floridians, the intensity of the rainfall falling from the afternoon storms and hurricanes has likely increased,” he said. “The pump is primed, if you will. I like to say these hurricanes probably are a little juicier because of the additional water vapor capacity.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2165384565.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.740836125969,100,78.518327748063" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="People look out onto a flooded street caused by the rain and storm surge from Stropical Storm Debby on August 5, 2024, in Cedar Key, Florida. | Joe Raedle/Getty Images via Inside Climate News" data-portal-copyright="Joe Raedle/Getty Images via Inside Climate News" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The atmosphere today holds about 10 percent more moisture, said Brian Soden, professor of atmospheric sciences at the Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science at the University of Miami.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It just compounds the problems you get from hurricanes,” he said. “You have not just the wind but more intense rain events. You have storm surge and higher sea levels, and gradually the sea levels rise higher. That means it takes longer for the rainfall to run off into the ocean in coastal regions, and that further compounds the flooding problems you experience.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Debby was the second hurricane to menace the US this year, after Beryl offered an explosive start to the season as the earliest Category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, according to the <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/category-5-hurricane-beryl-makes-explosive-start-2024-atlantic-season#:~:text=On%20July%202%2C%202024%2C%20Beryl,to%20the%20National%20Hurricane%20Center." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a> (NOAA). Beryl lost strength before making landfall on July 8 as a Category 1 storm near Matagorda, Texas, between Corpus Christi and Galveston. The hurricane season begins June 1 and peaks in August and September before ending November 30.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">NOAA had predicted an extraordinarily active season with 17 to 25 named storms, the greatest number the federal agency had projected since the forecasts began in 1998. The agency expected eight to 13 hurricanes and four to seven major hurricanes of category 3, 4, or 5 strength, packing winds of 111 miles an hour or more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">NOAA based its <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unprecedented forecast</a> on a confluence of factors, most notably unusually warm sea surface temperatures, which the agency said could power more storms. The forecasters also cited an anticipated quick transition to La Niña conditions, leading to a decrease in wind shear or atmospheric choppiness that can weaken or break apart storms. The average season features 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fellas, is it illegal for brands to refuse to advertise on my social media site? If you’re Elon Musk, the answer is yes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, Musk’s social media company X (formerly Twitter) filed an <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25033219/x-vs-advertisers.pdf">eyebrow-raising lawsuit</a> against an advertising industry group and several major brands, including Unilever (maker of Dove soap), Mars Inc. (maker of lots of candy), and CVS. It argues that the companies coordinated an advertising boycott against X that not only led to “massive economic harm,” but even violated antitrust law because they colluded to specifically target X, making it less competitive in selling digital ads.</p>

Advertisers fled, because businesses don’t want to risk their ads showing up next to objectionable or outright <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/musk-twitter-elon-child-abuse-material-rcna63621">illegal content</a>, like <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/twitter-ads-child-pornography-sexual-abuse-promote-b2177842.html">child sexual abuse material</a>. This is very bad for X, since, like other social media companies, it would go belly up without ad money. X contends this cessation of business is a “naked restraint of trade” because advertisers collectively forced the site to adhere to their content standards. It even had to lower its ad prices, the filing alleges.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lawsuit places the bulk of the blame on the <a href="https://wfanet.org/leadership/garm/about-garm">Global Alliance for Responsible Media</a> (GARM), an initiative launched in 2019 to establish a standard for brand safety across ad platforms. GARM’s membership, which was listed on the site <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240806201617/https://wfanet.org/leadership/garm/members-governance">as of August 6</a>, includes consumer brands, ad agencies, and media companies where ads are served (such as Spotify and, up until recently, X), asking them to commit to a shared understanding of what counts as <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2022/06/17/GARM-Brand-Safety-Floor--Suitability-Framework-3">harmful or risky content</a> that shouldn’t be monetized by ads. Membership is voluntary, and GARM says that individual advertisers ultimately decide how and where they advertise. It did not reply to a request for comment. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this has stopped X from portraying its <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/12/12/elon-musks-x-is-seeing-ad-revenue-plunge-by-half-from-prior-years-and-is-expected-to-bring-in-just-2-5b-this-year/">plummeting ad revenue</a> as a matter of criminal injustice. X says in the lawsuit that at least 18 GARM members pulled all ads from X in late 2022, while many more reduced their spending significantly. In a <a href="https://x.com/lindayaX/status/1820838625245880634">video</a> posted on X, CEO Linda Yaccarino made a grave appeal to X users, arguing that advertisers, not X’s chaotic management, have threatened the financial future of an important platform. “That puts your global town square — the one place that you can express yourself freely and openly — at long-term risk,” she said, echoing the refrain that X is a champion of uncensored free expression despite the fact that it moderates content, even if some say its <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/02/06/inside-elon-musk-x-twitter-austin-content-moderation/">policies are unclear</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">X’s lawsuit comes a month after a Republican-led <a href="https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/07/2024-07-10-GARMs-Harm-How-the-Worlds-Biggest-Brands-Seek-to-Control-Online-Speech.pdf">House Judiciary Committee report</a> and <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/collusion-global-alliance-responsible-media">hearing</a> on GARM made similar antitrust accusations, saying the group financially starved platforms hosting content it doesn’t approve of. It’s a continuation of a longer debate around free speech and its consequences. You have the right to speak, but do you have the right to get rich from monetizing your speech? If X goes bankrupt because it turns off too many advertisers, is anyone but X to blame?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Loyola University antitrust law professor Spencer Weber Waller, who <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/republicans-judiciary.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Waller%20Testimony.pdf">testified</a> at the GARM hearing, tells Vox that he’s skeptical of the lawsuit’s merits. “Just because you’re mad about something doesn’t mean it’s illegal,” he says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Elon’s beef with advertisers, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk has had a volatile relationship with X advertisers for years. Here’s a quick recap: Musk took over in October 2022 and started laying off thousands of employees. Some of the heaviest cuts were made to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/04/technology/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs.html">safety team</a>, including <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-twitter-layoffs-outsourced-content-moderators/">content moderators</a>, which signaled to advertisers that brand safety wouldn’t be a priority under Musk’s reign. Twitter’s old identity verification system, which gave a blue check mark to verified public figures and official brand accounts, was removed — which predictably led to a wave of trolls <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/verified-twitter-accounts-impersonating-lebron-james-george-w-bush-aroldis-chapman/">impersonating famous people</a> and companies. (Notably, pharma giant Eli Lilly’s stock tumbled when an impersonator tweeted that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/14/twitter-fake-eli-lilly/">insulin would now be free</a>.) All of this scared advertisers, and many big brands announced they were pausing their X ads in late 2022. A <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/elon-musk/less-month-elon-musk-has-driven-away-half-twitters-top-100-advertisers">Media Matters for America report</a> found that half of Twitter’s 100 biggest advertisers had paused spending in the first month of Musk’s takeover (only some of which are GARM members). Other <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/16/tech/x-ads-pro-nazi-account-brand-safety/index.html">controversies since then</a>, including ads being placed next to pro-Nazi content, have led to more advertisers shutting their pocketbooks. Data from the media intelligence firm Guideline shows there was a 65 percent decline in national ad spending on X between spring 2023 and 2024, according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/x-sues-ad-industry-group-some-top-advertisers?rc=eh9iin">The Information</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk seems to have taken this exodus as a personal affront. Last fall, at the annual business conference DealBook, he was outright hostile to the clients that make up the lifeblood of all social media companies. “If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/29/23981928/elon-musk-ad-boycott-go-fuck-yourself-destroy-x">go fuck yourself</a>,” he said during an interview with host Andrew Ross Sorkin. He later hedged the declaration at the Cannes Lions advertising awards, saying he <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-pitches-advertisers-on-a-return-to-x-months-after-telling-some-to-f-themselves-532d2745">didn’t mean all of them</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not uncommon for brands to pause ads when they fear reputational harm. Meta was the target of a brief but much-publicized anti-hate speech campaign called #StopHateForProfit in 2020, when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/business/media/facebook-boycott.html">over 1,000 companies</a> temporarily pulled ads on Facebook. When the heat dies down and brands are reassured that they won’t be promoted next to a post that, say, praises Hitler, they often return. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/13/technology/x-elon-musk-linda-yaccarino.html">New York Times reported</a> in June that X was claiming over half of its errant advertisers had come back in 2024. In <a href="https://x.com/Safety/status/1807793931003768991">early July</a>, X announced it had “reinstated” its GARM membership. Now, the relationship appears to have soured again.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">When is a boycott illegal?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a consumer, if you want to <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/4/12/23680135/bud-light-boycott-dylan-mulvaney-travis-tritt-trans">swear off Bud Lights</a> for the rest of your life — go wild. If it’s so successful (most consumer boycotts aren’t) that it leads to a company’s financial ruin, then too bad for them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It gets trickier when a bunch of companies boycott another company, which could be an illegal <a href="https://www.theantitrustattorney.com/antitrust-group-boycotts-competitors-conspiring/">group boycott</a>. Let’s say that you just opened a new lemon stall in town, but the neighborhood lemonade stand association tells you they made a pact not to buy your lemons unless you agree not to sell to one specific lemonade stand they hope will go out of business — you might want to complain to the Federal Trade Commission. For X to be the victim of an illegal boycott, first it has to establish there was an agreement between advertisers. X is arguing that GARM’s public statements amount to a coordinated boycott effort, mostly because of <a href="https://wfanet.org/knowledge/item/2022/10/31/GARM-calls-on-Twitter-to-uphold-existing-commitments-on-brand-safety-and-deepen-future-collaboration">an October 2022 letter</a> from GARM calling on the social media site to “uphold its previous commitments” to the alliance. It warned that it would watch the site’s content moderation efforts and that members would use GARM’s insights “as part of their own independent assessments.” X’s lawsuit claims the letter communicated “written plans for a conspiracy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But GARM members deny that there was any agreement or conspiracy. During the House Judiciary Committee’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmUfdnECOpA">hearing</a> this summer, the president of Unilever USA testified that GARM had never required it to avoid advertising on any platform. A big hurdle of the lawsuit is that X has to prove not just that companies adopted GARM’s standards and definitions of harmful content to justify pulling ads, but that there was a binding agreement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Antitrust law is concerned with actions that have major anticompetitive effects, often involving cartels. GARM doesn’t appear to be a cartel, a term that usually applies to competitors in a common industry making a commercially beneficial agreement with one another, like if egg producers banded together to limit the supply of eggs. The defendants will likely argue that they’re not competitors, nor is X a competitor — GARM is a vast coalition including ad groups, tech companies, car makers, consumer packaged goods brands, and more. At this point there’s no evidence that advertisers who left X were looking for a financial benefit by boycotting. Then there’s the First Amendment to consider: generally, political and social boycotts are protected even if the companies made an agreement that had an anticompetitive impact, says Waller. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Antitrust laws “generally don’t micromanage the decisions of corporations as they decide what’s best for them in the market,” Waller said during the hearing. Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) called the hearing a part of a “sham investigation,” saying that it served to “intimidate the exercise of free speech.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unclear how far X’s lawsuit will get. Musk is certainly no stranger to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musk-revives-lawsuit-against-sam-altman-openai-nyt-reports-2024-08-05">both suing</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/elon-musk-s-pile-of-lawsuits-span-autopilot-toxic-speech-ai?embedded-checkout=true">being sued</a>. Sometimes the fight has <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23585251/elon-musk-tesla-trial-verdict">unexpectedly gone his way</a>, while other times it hasn’t. Recently, a California court dismissed a lawsuit X filed last year against a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/25/elon-musk-x-hate-speech-lawsuit">hate speech watchdog</a> that had documented the rise of hateful rhetoric on the site. With this latest legal volley, X is making the Hotel California argument: Advertisers can check out any time they like, but they can never leave.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This weekend, one of the most popular books of the decade is making its way to the big screen. Colleen Hoover’s <em>It Ends With Us</em>, a romantic tearjerker about breaking the cycle of abuse that became a social media sensation after it was published in 2016, is now a movie starring Blake Lively. The moment means the mainstream coronation of Hoover herself, the former social worker from Texas turned queen of the New York Times bestseller list.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoover sells books the way Danielle Steel used to sell books. She sells the way Stephen King still does. She sells the way new authors usually don’t. In 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/09/books/colleen-hoover.html">she held six of the top 10 spots on the Times’s paperback bestseller list at once</a> and sold more books than the Bible. According to industry tracker Circana BookScan, Hoover has sold 28.9 million books in print, plus 7 million ebooks. <em>It Ends With Us</em>, probably her most popular novel, has sold 6.9 million print and ebooks combined. It has been on the New York Times bestseller list for 131 weeks, and it is currently at the top.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoover began as a self-published indie author, releasing her first novel, <em>Slammed</em>, in January 2012 when she was 42. She had already found what would become her sweet spot of melodrama combined with taboo romance: The book featured an 18-year-old grieving the death of her father and in love with her poetry teacher. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Slammed</em> unexpectedly became <a href="https://www.maryse.net/books/contemporary-romance/book-review-slammed-by-colleen-hoover.html">a word-of-mouth hit among book bloggers</a>. By August, the book and its sequel, published a month later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/09/books/colleen-hoover.html">were on the New York Times bestseller list</a>, and Hoover had a traditional publishing contract. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Colleen Hoover superfan” and “Colleen Hoover hater” are both legible identities in a way that they are for few other authors </p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since then, Hoover has published 24 books, counting her novellas, typically releasing at least one book a year, more frequently two and sometimes up to three or four. She has always sold well, but her career shifted into another gear in 2020, when the pandemic left readers in need of a good cry and BookTok emerged as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23644772/booktok-money-business-sponsored-videos">a hit-maker</a>. On BookTok, Hoover fans <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/06/how-crying-tiktoks-made-colleen-hoover-a-millionaire-author/">could film themselves weeping over her books</a>, tossing them across the room out of pure emotional overwhelm, sighing over her heroes. Her sales figures exploded in response.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Hoover hasn’t published a book since 2022. <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/why-did-colleen-hoover-stop-writing/">Asked why</a>, she says she’s become very aware of how vast her audience is.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoover has a point: Her audience numbers in the millions. It’s also polarized. In the emotional landscape of BookTok, “Colleen Hoover superfan” and “Colleen Hoover hater” are both legible identities in a way that they are for few other authors. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Hoover fans film themselves sobbing over her books, Hoover haters post about flipping her books around at bookstores so that the covers are backward. They create detailed video essays laying out all the things they think are wrong with Hoover’s books: her simple sentences, her melodramatic plots, her toxic love stories that they say romanticize abuse. Or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@elisereadz/video/7286134473861696801?lang=en">they just point to a line of text</a> she’s written and say, “What the fuck?” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s something about these books that seems to inspire intense reactions in their readers, ranging from sublime catharsis to visceral disgust. Here are the reasons so many of Hoover’s readers have become such ardent, adoring fans — and so many others have become such ferocious haters.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hoover’s subject matter is heavy, but her writing style is bubbly and fun. The contrast is weird.</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoover’s romantic melodramas tend to deal with intense real-life issues that some of her readers have surely experienced. All her characters are traumatized; all their children are destined for untimely deaths; all their love stories are twisted and tragic. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Ugly Love</em> (2014) features a hero who, following the death of his newborn baby, has sworn he’ll never love again. <em>All Your Perfects</em> (2018) deals with a couple struggling with infertility. In <em>November 9</em> (2015), a woman badly scarred by a house fire falls in love with a man still grieving the death of his mother, who died by suicide.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of what sets Hoover apart from other writers of melodrama (think: Nicholas Sparks) is that despite the trauma her characters must face, she writes them with a breezy romantic comedy charm. They meet cute, they banter, and they trade inside jokes as their worlds collapse around them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The juxtaposition between Hoover’s bubbly prose style and the intensity of her subject matter creates a jarring contrast. Her books are almost magnetically readable: The sentences are easy and pleasant to read while the plots are shocking and intense. You can blaze through one in a day. You can, if you are so inclined, fall in love with her troubled alpha male heroes, her tormented and striving heroines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>They meet cute, they banter, and they trade inside jokes as their worlds collapse around them</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Hoover’s fans, this effect is something they love about her books. She makes reading feel straightforward and easy, even if you’re not naturally inclined to be bookish.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Hoover’s haters, however, the contrast is one of the signs that there’s something dishonest, even perhaps morally wrong, about the way she writes. How, they ask, can she expect her audience to take her subject matter seriously when she handles it so lightly? These readers feel there is something crassly manipulative about the way Hoover dredges up tragedy to make her readers cry, and then tosses it aside when she doesn’t want to deal with any of the parts that might be trickier to write or read about.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a paragraph in <em>Ugly Love</em> that has become <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AreTheStraightsOK/comments/17b6vrv/im_not_sure_colleen_hoover_is_okay/">something of a meme among Hoover haters</a> that exemplifies how oddly her banter can read. It’s a conversation between Miles, one of the novel’s narrators, and his girlfriend Rachel after they’ve just had a baby:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Thank you for this baby,” she says from the back seat. “He’s beautiful.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">I laugh. “You’re responsible for the beautiful part, Rachel. The only thing he got from me was his balls.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">She laughs. She laughs hard. “Oh my God, I know,” she says. “They’re so big.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">We both laugh at our son’s big balls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoover haters love to roast her for everything about this paragraph: the idea of parents mocking their kid’s genitalia, the simplistic sentence structure, the non sequitur of the joke. The context around these lines, however, make the situation and dialogue perhaps even more off-putting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the young parents in this novel are step-siblings who carried on their forbidden love affair in their parents’ house, a taboo plot twist that never pays off into any major revelations or insight into their characters. Second, the balls joke is followed immediately by tragedy: they get into a car crash, and the big-balled newborn baby dies. (I told you all the babies die.) For Hoover haters, the moment is an encapsulation of everything that makes her books bad: the cutesy romantic “joke” right up against the pointless and out-of-nowhere drama, all of it handled in the very worst of taste.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoover’s defenders, meanwhile, say that she writes books that are fun to read and that bring awareness to important issues. In particular, <em>It Ends With Us</em> has <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27362503-it-ends-with-us">staunch fans</a> who describe it, echoing the blurb on the cover, as the kind of book “every person with a heartbeat should read.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even most of Hoover’s haters <a href="https://youtu.be/U8zP5R3kh3o?si=9J61fLCgbutyTQmj">will concede</a> that <em>It Ends With Us</em> is one of her more ambitious books. Inspired by the marriage of Hoover’s parents, it puts readers in the head of our protagonist, Lily, as she first falls in love with and then grows gradually more afraid of manipulative, controlling, violent Ryle Kincaid. Lily thinks of herself as the kind of person who knows better than to stay with an abuser, but when Ryle gets violent with her — first hitting, then choking — she finds herself making excuses for him. It’s only when he eventually throws her down a flight of stairs and then sexually assaults her (and another potential love interest presents himself) that Lily finally decides to leave Ryle.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/img3.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" alt="A man and a woman gaze intensely at each other, cupping each other’s faces with their hands, in a moodily-lit bar." title="A man and a woman gaze intensely at each other, cupping each other’s faces with their hands, in a moodily-lit bar." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni as Lily and Ryle in &lt;em&gt;It Ends With Us&lt;/em&gt;. | Sony Pictures" data-portal-copyright="Sony Pictures" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The result is a didactic novel clearly written to explain why a person in an abusive relationship might find it difficult to leave her abuser, and then show how she might find the strength to do so anyway. This is why <em>It Ends With Us</em> is deeply important to many Hoover fans. It’s the kind of novel, they say, that makes you cry for the terrible dilemma of its heroine, that has the power to change the way you see abused women.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Hoover’s critics say <em>It Ends With Us</em> is just like the rest of the books in her oeuvre: crassly using big, complicated stories for cheap tears and easy money. Hoover’s male characters tend to be domineering, in a way that is often supposed to be part of their appeal. Ryle, they point out, isn’t the only Hoover hero to override his girlfriend’s “no” when he touches her —&nbsp;he’s just the only one labeled an abuser when he does so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Haters cite Hoover’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/1b2y5c7/colleen_hoover_releases_a_nail_polish_kit_thats/"><em>It Ends With Us</em> nail polish line</a> and a planned-but-never-published <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/colleen-hoover-coloring-book-cancellation-intl-scli/index.html"><em>It Ends With Us</em> coloring book</a> as evidence that domestic abuse, like the dead baby with large testicles, is just another thing that Hoover will take heavily when she wants to make you cry, and lightly when she wants to keep things easy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The genre question</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the reason readers have a hard time grappling with Hoover’s work is the question of what genre she’s writing in, and what expectations they should hold for her. It’s hard to know what you’re going to get when you open one of her books cold, which is part of why it’s hard to know in what spirit to take her writing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Hoover transitioned from indie author into traditional publishing in 2012, she was positioned as New Adult author, <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html">a buzzy new marketing category</a>. The millennial YA audience that had made books like <em>Twilight</em> and <em>The Hunger Games</em> such sensations would soon be aging out of their market, publishers feared. Surely they would need new books as they left high school and entered the real world: books that were just as fun and straightforward to read as the YA they’d left behind, but with the sexy darkness that had been trending up in YA made explicit. New Adult books would provide just such a thrill for readers 18 through 23. Hoover, with her grabby pacing, steamy sex scenes, melodramatic subject matter, and straightforwardly bouncy prose, was an ideal author for the new genre.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem was that New Adult never took off. Few bookstores ever installed New Adult shelves. The readers who wanted to keep reading YA-style books stuck to YA, which is now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/30/more-than-a-quarter-of-readers-of-ya-are-over-the-age-of-28-research-shows">primarily read by adults</a>. Those who wanted more adult books transitioned to other categories like romance or thrillers or literary fiction. The newly established New Adult writers were left at sea.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Hoover’s books are generally sold as romance novels. For readers, that’s a label that comes with expectations. It means that the characters should strive towards a healthy and aspirational relationship, that they should finish the book happy together forever. That is not the kind of story Hoover is interested in writing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some romance readers say they’d be happy with Hoover’s novels if she would simply call them dark romance, a subgenre that comes with the presumption that there will be a fair amount of sexy toxicity. (If romance novels in the ’70s were all about wickedly brooding men kidnapping and ravishing innocent virgins, dark romance is where that formula lives on.) Hoover, obligingly, has a couple of her more twisted novels labeled as dark romance on her website. Still, she prefers not to follow the genre’s latest guidance for <a href="https://bookriot.com/dark-romance-books-2/">a page of “trigger warnings”</a> at the front of her novels. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’ve received quite a number of negative reviews in relation to the lack of a trigger warning for the subject matter…and for writing about such unhappy things,” <a href="https://writerunboxed.com/2016/08/19/writing-in-a-trigger-happy-world/">Hoover wrote in a now-deleted blog post in 2016</a>. “As a fellow reader with my fair share of past experiences, I understand that there are issues some people do not want to read about. But as a writer, there are many things I don’t want revealed in the blurbs of my books.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoover’s fans defend her distaste for content warnings as a display of artistic integrity. Her tragedies rely on an element of surprise for their immediacy: The reader is shocked by sudden horror in the same way the characters are. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, that surprise is central to the intended effect of the book. <em>It Ends With Us</em> has a back cover blurb suggesting that Ryle’s fear of commitment will be the primary obstacle in the novel. The reveal that Ryle is not just opposed to marriage but is in fact violently abusive is part of how readers are brought to empathize with Lily when she finds herself making excuses for Ryle’s behavior, even though she thinks she knows better: We thought she was in a romance the same way she did. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Hoover detractors, though, Hoover’s distaste for content warnings is another tell that she thinks of the issues she’s writing about as plot devices, not as real problems that affect real people. Why, they ask, is she prioritizing the element of surprise over the possibility of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/13uw71y/why_tf_doesnt_it_ends_with_us_have_a_trigger/">triggering trauma flashbacks in an unsuspecting reader</a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Either way, Hoover once again finds herself at odds with the genre in which she’s been tentatively placed: too sad for traditional romance, too traditional for dark romance, too popular for New Adult. Readers coming to her never quite have a sense of what she’s going to give them, and the traditional signposts of publishing don’t seem to serve her well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoover doesn’t necessarily seem to mind that she’s hard to pigeonhole. In an interview with Vulture in 2022, Hoover mused that her most popular books seem to be the inspirational <em>It Ends With Us</em> and the psychosexual <em>Rebecca</em>-inspired <em>Verity</em>. (<em>Verity</em>’s one of those books that merits the dark romance label.) “I like that my readers’ tastes land on opposite ends of a reading spectrum, and I especially love it when their two favorites are books that are nothing alike,” <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/colleen-hoover-best-books-most-romantic-riskiest.html">Hoover said</a>. “It reinforces my decision not to stick to one genre.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s true that Hoover’s readership tends to land on opposite ends of a reading spectrum — both in the way they like her books and in the way they hate them. But regardless of how many and how vocal the Hoover haters are, her books keep selling. Her reign at the top of the New York Times bestseller list will last as long as she has books to sell — which, depending on how long her writer’s block lasts, may be a very long time or no time at all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is one thing Donald Trump’s critics and fans can agree on: He is not an intellectual. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His politics come from the gut, a combination of his own instincts and an animalistic talent for reading his supporters’ emotions and enthusiasms. The idea that Trump is attuned to the debates roiling conservative intellectuals — arguments about Hungarian family policy and concepts with names like “postliberalism” — doesn’t pass the laugh test.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet in Trump’s first term, his intellectual incuriosity opened up a curious avenue for ideas to matter. With the president in his own world, various senior staffers had the ability to build little fiefdoms, each working to turn their own beliefs into official US policy. In the past, that often meant old-school Republicans obstructing Trump or even slipping their own policies in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/4/2/17170040/trump-russia-policy-incoherent">under his nose</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A second term would likely be different. Since 2020, Trump has purged much of the Republican old guard. Trump-aligned institutions like the Heritage Foundation have put together <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/jul/01/kevin-roberts-trump-heritage-foundation-project-2025">vast lists of loyal staff</a> who can come in on day one. A second Trump term would likely be a self-consciously revolutionary project: one in which Trump-aligned ideologues work to turn vague outlines of Trumpism into a governing doctrine. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With Trump-aligned ideologues running the show in the White House, the ideological debates inside the Trump movement would be far more than a matter of intellectual curiosity. The ideas that have captured the MAGA world’s imagination could well be shaping the future of the United States —&nbsp;and quite possibly the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The six thinkers below have developed some of these influential ideas. Their worldviews are diverse and heterodox, advancing political visions that sound extreme or even outlandish. One is a Silicon Valley monarchist blogger, another a retired Harvard professor who writes on the virtues of “manliness.” A third is a deceased proponent of state-run economies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite their differences, it is impossible to understand the modern Trump-aligned right without appreciating their influence. Studying them closely will do more than clarify what the MAGA movement wants in the abstract; it will help us think through what its return to power might mean for all of us.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Patrick Deneen, the regime changer</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In May 2023, now-vice presidential nominee JD Vance appeared <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?528162-1/regime-change">at a book event in Washington for Patrick Deneen</a>, a conservative political theorist at the University of Notre Dame. The book, <em>Regime Change</em>, received an enthusiastic response from the panel; Vance told the audience that he viewed his political mission as “explicitly anti-regime.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what does that mean, exactly? To understand, it’s worth looking at Deneen’s ideas — and the broader “postliberal” movement he belongs to.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/AP23188630609311.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="An image of JD Vance and Patrick Deneen in a lecture hall" title="An image of JD Vance and Patrick Deneen in a lecture hall" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) greets University of Notre Dame professor of political science Patrick Deneen before a panel discussion on regime change and the future of liberalism at Catholic University in Washington, DC, on May 17, 2023. | Associated Press" data-portal-copyright="Associated Press" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Deneen’s first big book, <em>Why Liberalism Failed</em>, argued that the shared philosophy of the American center — a liberalism focused on rights and individual freedom — had produced a miserable world. While claiming to liberate people to pursue their own life plan, liberalism in fact cut them off from traditional sources of community and stability. Americans were depressed, lonely, and immiserated — and they had their governing consensus to blame.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the book’s success, Deneen would become a leader in the emerging “postliberal” movement: a heavily-Catholic group of conservative scholars developing a political vision of an America beyond liberalism. Their basic idea is abandoning liberalism’s core commitment to neutrality about the good life and instead proposing a politics in which the US government uses policy to foster Christian virtue among its citizens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Different postliberals have different ideas of what that looks like. Adrian Vermeule, a Harvard law professor, argues for integralism — an old Catholic idea that essentially merges elements of the Church into the state. Other postliberals, like Gladden Pappin and Rod Dreher, have become champions of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s vision of “illiberal democracy” —&nbsp;literally taking <a href="https://hiia.hu/en/gladden-j-pappin-phd/">posts</a> in <a href="https://danubeinstitute.hu/en/authors/dreher-rod">Budapest</a> at government-aligned institutions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Deneen’s own path to postliberalism, presented in <em>Regime Change</em>, is, well, regime change: “the peaceful but vigorous overthrow of a corrupt and corrupting liberal ruling class and the creation of a postliberal order in which existing political forms can remain in place, as long as a fundamentally different ethos informs those institutions and the personnel who populate key offices and positions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On its face, this is an exceptionally radical proposition. It would require, at minimum, hollowing out the US government by replacing most of its key leadership with dedicated postliberals. These people would then use their posts from within to promote a conservative Christian vision for governance without formally changing the foundations of the American system — in effect, a quiet, invisible overthrow of the government.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Vance declares himself to be a “<a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/takeaways-aps-report-jd-vance-and-catholic-postliberals-his-circle-influence">postliberal</a>” with “explicitly anti-regime” politics, this is the cause to which he’s dedicating himself. But what does that look like in more concrete terms?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>Regime Change</em>, Deneen himself doesn’t <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/15/23734340/patrick-deneen-regime-change-review">match his radical rhetoric with radical policy</a>. Most of the specific ideas presented in the book are either widely discussed among the American elite (like national service for teens) or already implemented (like tariffs aimed to improve domestic manufacturing). Those handful that are truly radical tend to be unconstitutional (a total ban on pornography) or narrowly focused on higher education.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, for the most part, Deneen’s work shouldn’t be seen as a policy guide for a second Trump term. However, it can be seen as an <em>inspiration</em> for how some of its top officials see their jobs. Talk of an evil “regime” in Washington is now widespread on the intellectual right; Vance and other like-minded Trump officials will see their task in the second term as moving against it. Their task of rooting out the “deep state” is not merely revenge against Trump’s enemies but a revolutionary Christian act of laying the groundwork for a postliberal America.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">James Burnham, prophet of “managerialism”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silicon Valley is typically seen as a place obsessed with the new. But in the tech conservative set likely to influence a second Trump term — people like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel — there’s recently been a renewed interest in <a href="https://www.vox.com/23505311/elon-musk-twitter-managerial-woke-james-burnham">a 1941 book by conservative intellectual James Burnham</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The book, titled <em>The Managerial Revolution</em>, prefigured the current right’s concerns about “wokeness” conquering the American business world. Despite a series of almost comically wrong predictions, it remains an important guide to how a second Trump term might conceive of its role in waging culture war.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/James_Burnham_TheManagerialRevolution.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.511558766628,100,34.976882466745" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Burnham’s book predicts a world defined by class war between the capitalist and “managerial” classes (the proletariat, in his view, are too weak and disorganized to seize power). He defines the managerial class as the people who supervise the key functions of a modern economy: “operating executives, superintendents, administrative engineers, supervisory technicians; or, in government &#8230; administrators, commissioners, bureau heads, and so on.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Burnham’s view, a complex modern economy inevitably directs power away from capitalists and toward managers. Because the managers actually understand and direct the technical tasks involved in modern corporate life, they truly control the means of production. Their nominal bosses, the capitalists, only owe their power to little pieces of paper calling them owners; the managers can, and almost certainly will, figure out some way to seize full control.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This, for Burnham, meant a future of state-controlled economies. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union would prove that state-controlled industry, where managers didn’t have to deal with capitalist overlords, would be so efficient that they’d consign democratic capitalism to history’s dustbin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, we know Burnham’s predictions were wrong in basically every particular. So why his enduring influence on the right, and especially those conservatives in tech — the sector that singlehandedly has proven that technical experts can become capitalist titans?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer is the culture war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silicon Valley’s conservative CEOs and venture capitalists often have to deal with an employee base with radically different politics. While these tech leaders may be all-in on Trump, your average engineer or programmer is much like other college-educated American urbanites: <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/workers-several-large-us-tech-companies-overwhelmingly-back-kamala-harris-data-2024-09-09/">very liberal</a>. Feeling besieged and hemmed in by their own employees, tech conservatives see Burnham as a prophet of their lived experience.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Most woke ‘labor’ scandals in tech are an entitled middle-management class at odds with founders.” <a href="https://twitter.com/antoniogm/status/1593606745955348481">writes Antonio García Martínez</a>, an influential tech conservative. “What Elon is doing [at X] is a revolt by entrepreneurial capital against the professional-managerial class regime that otherwise everywhere dominates (including and especially large tech companies).”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inasmuch as the tech conservative sector wields influence in a second Trump term, we should expect a good chunk of their efforts to be directed along Burnhamite lines. They will want the administration’s assistance not only in slashing taxes and regulations but in ensuring their own control over unruly “woke” employees.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Curtis Yarvin, the monarchist</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Curtis Yarvin, a blogger also known by the pen name “Mencius Moldbug,” fuses many of the traits of our first two entries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like Deneen, Yarvin believes that the liberal American “regime” must be overthrown. He has also been cited by JD Vance as an influence — specifically <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23373795/curtis-yarvin-neoreaction-redpill-moldbug">on the question of seizing control over executive branch staff</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And like Burnham, an <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/05/third-thoughts-on-james-burnham/">avowed influence on his thought</a>, Yarvin believes that society is defined by a struggle for power between competing elite groups. Yarvin is likewise widely influential among tech conservatives —&nbsp;he is, in fact, <a href="https://urbit.org/blog/a-founders-farewell">a Silicon Valley entrepreneur himself</a>.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Curtis_Yarvin.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,28.249011842525,100,43.50197631495" alt="A black and white portrait photo of a white middle-aged man with long hair and glasses." title="A black and white portrait photo of a white middle-aged man with long hair and glasses." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Curtis Yarvin. | David Merfield" data-portal-copyright="David Merfield" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But unlike either of them, Yarvin has advanced a clear vision for what 21st century America should look like. Democracy, he believes, should be toppled — replaced instead with a new kind of corporate monarchy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A well-managed enterprise hires the right people, spends the right amount of money on them, and makes sure they do the right things. How do we achieve effective management? We know one simple way: find the right person, and put him or her in charge,” <a href="https://www.unqualified-reservations.org/2008/05/ol6-lost-theory-of-government/">he writes</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Yarvin’s view, the United States has approximated this system under three presidents: George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Because the country was either young or in crisis, these leaders wielded extraordinary amounts of power — which Yarvin believes was mistakenly taken from our chief executives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These three Presidents, and to some extent a few more, were almost true CEOs of the executive branch. Their monarchical regimes then decayed into oligarchies, each of which was rebooted by the next monarchy. By the clock, we are about due for another,” <a href="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/the-butterfly-revolution" data-type="link" data-id="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/the-butterfly-revolution">he writes.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Naturally, Yarvin has implied that Trump might be the man to turn the clock forward. In an interview with Michael Anton, a former senior official in the Trump National Security Council, Yarvin mused about the <a href="https://theweek.com/politics/1003035/the-far-right-contemplates-an-american-caesar">mechanics of a Caesarist takeover by Trump</a>. This includes setting up an app, “the Trump app,” designed to get millions of supporters out into the streets to support a series of swiftly executed power grabs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At other times, however, Yarvin has expressed skepticism that Trump has the chops to execute this kind of audacious authoritarian coup. “He is who he is. His capacities are what they are,” Yarvin mused resignedly in <a href="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/the-butterfly-revolution">a 2022 essay</a>. In his mind, someone like Elon Musk would be a better choice for dictator/CEO.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yarvin’s not wrong about Trump’s unserviceability. Nothing that happened between 2017 and 2021 suggests that Trump would be able to competently execute the sort of swift and total fascist coup Yarvin envisions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Yarvin’s work is still important for understanding how far a second Trump term might go.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is a person who is openly musing about destroying democracy and who has built up a fan base among people like Vance and Anton in Trump’s immediate orbit <em>because</em> of this work. You can hear echoes of his generalized contempt for democracy in <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/185487/trump-maga-legal-war-slow-burn-authoritarianism">the litany of actual antidemocratic policies being contemplated in a second Trump term</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harvey Mansfield, student of manliness</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No discussion of intellectual influences on Trump’s second term is complete without a discussion of gender. It’s a topic that, as Vance’s pronouncements about “childless cat ladies” illustrate, has become increasingly central to the modern right’s ideology —&nbsp;and one where the right is rapidly evolving in a more radical direction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And when it comes to gender politics, few on the right command the intellectual influence of Harvey Manfield —&nbsp;a nonagenarian political theorist who recently retired from Harvard.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2035880503.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Harvey Mansfield, an elderly white man in a suit and tie, sitting in a patch of light within a dark living room" title="Harvey Mansfield, an elderly white man in a suit and tie, sitting in a patch of light within a dark living room" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Harvey Mansfield." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">During his 61-year tenure at America’s most famous college, Mansfield became a conservative institution unto himself: a beachhead in enemy-occupied territory, an Ivy Leaguer who has been mentor to some of the movement’s leading lights. His former graduate students include Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), leading pro-Trump intellectual <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22278065/donald-trump-conservative-politics-charles-kesler">Charles Kesler</a>, and the famous Never Trump writer Bill Kristol.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mansfield, an erudite Tocqueville scholar, disdains Trump — describing him <a href="https://www.persuasion.community/p/mansfield">as a demagogue and a vulgarian</a>. Yet in <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2023/7/12/harvey-mansfield-retires/">a recent interview</a>, Mansfield said he voted for said vulgarian in 2020 “with many misgivings” (Mansfield adds that he “crossed [Trump] off [his] list entirely” after the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He has offered striking praise of Trump in one area: gender. Trump, he <a href="https://contemporarythinkers.org/harvey-mansfield/commentary/manhood-age-trump/">said in one interview</a>, was “really the first American politician” to win office via “a display of manliness and an attack on political correctness.” He beat Hillary Clinton, per Mansfield, because American elections are “tests of manliness” — and “it’s difficult for a woman to do that in a graceful way, and to maintain her femininity.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mansfield’s 2006 book <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Manliness/NsIU55H6_DUC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1"><em>Manliness</em></a> attacks what he sees as the end goal of modern feminism —&nbsp; a “gender-neutral society” — as willful denial of reality. Enduring inequalities, like women’s disproportionate share of home labor, reflect not discrimination but rather the essential influence of “manliness” on men.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Manliness, in his account, is a kind of self-reliant commanding decisiveness — a willingness to blaze a risky path and lead others along it. While women can be manly — Mansfield cites Margaret Thatcher as an example — they generally are not. For Mansfield, “common sense” stereotypes about men and women are mostly true and validated by the evidence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Women still rather like housework, changing diapers, and manly men. The capacities and inclinations of the sexes do not differ exactly or universally, but they do seem to differ,” he writes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mansfield here is giving voice to a bedrock conservative belief that the gender binary is an essential component of human nature. Men are generally one way and women are generally another; this, for conservatives, is an eternal truth about humanity that liberals deny at their peril.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This idea doesn’t just shape the way that conservatives think about feminism: It is also central to the way they approach trans issues. So much of conservative rhetoric on the topic is about insisting on the <em>illegitimacy</em> of trans identity and being infuriated that they are now “expected to call a man a woman” because trans people complicated the division between what Mansfield calls the enduring “capacities and inclinations of the sexes.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If we want to understand how a second Trump term will approach hot-button issues surrounding gender, there are few clearer animating spirits than Mansfield-style insistence on the truth of the gender binary —&nbsp;and anger at the ways in which “gender-neutral society” devalues traditional manliness.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Christopher Caldwell, the ethnic majoritarian</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Christopher Caldwell is perhaps the most highbrow right-wing populist in American media today. A New York Times opinion contributor with a literary profile —&nbsp;he is, among other things, on the editorial committee of a prominent French intellectual journal — few have been as successful at bringing Trump-friendly arguments to liberalism’s salons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, Caldwell’s oeuvre is the mirror image of Yarvin’s. While Yarvin advances an openly antidemocratic rule by an elite minority, Caldwell has built an argument for unfettered majority rule.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/AgeOfEntitlement.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.809040916393,100,34.381918167215" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In his most recent book, <em>The Age of Entitlement</em>, Caldwell <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/19/21116713/civil-rights-christopher-caldwell-age-of-entitlement">argues that the 1964 Civil Rights Act is responsible</a> for much of what right-wing Americans find baleful about American culture today (such as “wokeness”). He writes that white people “fell asleep thinking of themselves as the people who had built this country and woke up to find themselves occupying the bottom rung of an official hierarchy of races.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This idea, that America is now a society that formally discriminates against white people, is a major influence on the Trumpist right today. Stephen Miller, Trump’s immigration czar and leading adviser, has founded a law firm — America First Legal —&nbsp;that has dedicated much of its efforts to filing suits alleging anti-white discrimination. If elected, a Trump administration would almost <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357963/republicans-white-identity-politics-newsletter">certainly attempt to revamp civil rights law to center this alleged scourge</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, Caldwell hardly invented the idea of “reverse discrimination.” But he did break new ground in explicitly linking the problem to the very idea of federal civil rights protections itself, suggesting (<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/19/21116713/civil-rights-christopher-caldwell-age-of-entitlement">albeit not outright owning</a>) a radical remedy to the problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is especially important in light of his praise for elected authoritarians abroad.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In my book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94"><em>The Reactionary Spirit</em></a>, I looked at three examples of foreign heads of state who have taken a hammer to the democracies they govern: Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, and Narendra Modi in India. In each case, the evidence of their antidemocratic bent is damning,&nbsp;ranging from systematic attacks on the freedom of the press to attempts to undermine the independence of election administration officials and the judiciary.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caldwell has written essays defending <a href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/hungary-and-the-future-of-europe/">each</a> of <a href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/indias-uprising/">these</a> <a href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/is-israel-defensible/">leaders</a> from charges of authoritarianism. His work reads like prestige feature journalism but is weak on the merits — <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/5/21/21256324/viktor-orban-hungary-american-conservatives">ignoring contradictory evidence to the point of dishonesty</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Caldwell seems to admire in these leaders is their ability to turn visions of right-wing ethnonationalist government into reality. He describes them (often misleadingly) as the voices of the true majority, fighting a decadent left that had been imposing its will on an unwilling populace for too long.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This core commitment to ethnic majoritarianism is what links his work on foreign governments to his critique of the Civil Rights Act —&nbsp;and what makes Caldwell so important for understanding a second Trump term. He is hostile to civil rights law, and friendly to foreign ethnonationalists, because he believes that there is something fundamentally undemocratic about the enterprise of legally protecting minority rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We … like to pretend that protecting minorities always means protecting them against abuse and persecution by majorities. Sometimes it does. But just as often it means claiming prerogatives for minorities against the innocent preferences of democratic majorities,” he writes in <a href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/indias-uprising/">his essay on Modi</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This spells out, perhaps more clearly than Caldwell intended, the vision of “democracy” that animates Trumpism: The strong do what they will, and the weak suffer what they must.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Elbridge Colby, the China hawk</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since World War II, American foreign policy has centered around maintaining its core alliances in Europe. We all know that Donald Trump has little interest in keeping those in good shape. But what would a more Trumpy alternative look like?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elbridge Colby, one of the brightest young(er) lights of the GOP foreign policy establishment, has a clear answer: Put fighting China at the top of the to-do list.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2164097004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A white, middle-aged man wearing a suit speaks into a podium microphone." title="A white, middle-aged man wearing a suit speaks into a podium microphone." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Elbridge Colby." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In his 2021 book <a href="https://www.google.ca/books/edition/The_Strategy_of_Denial/qCQ7EAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=elbridge+colby&amp;printsec=frontcover"><em>The Strategy of Denial</em></a>, Colby argues that the rise of China has fundamentally changed the nature of international politics. Because of China’s extraordinary size and rapidly advancing armed forces, it poses a geostrategic threat to the United States unlike that of any state in recent memory. Were China to fully displace America as the dominant power in East Asia, Colby writes, it would be a dire threat to “Americans’ security, freedom, and prosperity.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In his view, Beijing aspires to attain dominance by exerting effective control over nearby states — beginning with Taiwan but expanding outward from there. The only way to stop China from doing so is to invest massive amounts of resources in the region, enough to prevent it from believing that it has a chance of simply running over its neighbors with relative ease.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Colby’s “strategy of denial” depends on America being selective. In his view, China is so strong that the US must scale down its commitments elsewhere in order to concentrate all attention where it really matters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Its first, overriding priority must be an effective defense of allies in Asia against China,” he writes. And, as such, “the United States should seek to have European states assume the greater role in NATO.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This worldview has made Colby into one of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/18/taiwan-ukraine-support-russia-china/">most articulate skeptics</a> about America’s ongoing commitment to Ukraine. Every dollar the United States spends on helping the Ukrainian war effort is a dollar less for helping Taiwan prepare to fight a Chinese invasion. We need to avoid “getting bogged down in Europe,” as he put it in a Fox News appearance, and begin pivoting to Taiwan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Colby has real pull in the GOP: He served in Trump’s first-term Department of Defense and, per Politico, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/04/11/tucker-carlson-eldridge-colby-00090211">currently has Vance’s ear</a>. And his worldview is consistent with Trump’s on more than just Europe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the great misapprehensions about the former president is that he is an isolationist or even a critic of American empire. <a href="https://www.vox.com/23677654/trump-foreign-policy-revisionist-history-dove-anti-imperial">Neither is true</a>: Trump used force aggressively during his first term, but did so less in the name of “protecting democracy” or other such lofty goals than in favor of American interests narrowly construed. In service of this vision, his administration oversaw <a href="https://airwars.org/conflict-data/civilian-deaths-by-us-president-in-iraq-and-syria/">bombings in Iraq and Syria</a> that killed thousands of civilians.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trumpian critique has never been that America should voluntarily weaken its military or retreat from the world. Rather, it’s that the United States should focus on its own interests, eschewing any of this “rules-based order” nonsense in favor of taking what’s ours.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In that general sense, Trump and Colby are a perfect fit. But it’s less clear whether Trump shares Colby’s assessment of China as a military threat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As much as he loves to complain about Chinese trade practices, Trump has also repeatedly expressed admiration for President Xi Jinping&nbsp;— an admiration <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/11/3/16603024/trump-visit-china-xi-jinping-state-north-korea">the Chinese have built up through aggressive flattery</a>. So while Colby’s ideas are almost certain to play some role in shaping a second Trump term, there is a real question over whether they’ll play a dominant one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is Donald Trump on track to win a historic share of voters of color in November’s presidential election?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the surface, it’s one of the most confounding questions of the Trump years in American politics. Trump —&nbsp;and the Republican Party in his thrall —&nbsp;has embraced anti-immigrant policies and proposals, peddled racist stereotypes, and demonized immigrants. So why does it look like he might win over and hold the support of greater numbers of nonwhite voters than the Republican Party of years past?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In poll after poll, he’s hitting or exceeding the levels of support he received in 2020 from Latino and Hispanic voters. He’s <a href="https://aapidata.com/featured/2024-asian-american-voter-survey/">primed</a> to make inroads among Asian American voters, whose Democratic loyalty has <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-07-25/election-2024-asian-american-voters-kamala-harris-trump">gradually</a> been declining over the last few election cycles. And the numbers he’s posting with Black voters <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/upshot/kamala-harris-trump-polls.html">suggest</a> the largest racial realignment in an election since the signing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a plethora of explanations for this shift, but first, some points of clarification. The pro-Trump shift is concentrated among Hispanic and Latino voters, though it has appeared to be spreading to parts of the Black and Asian American electorate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, things have changed since Vice President Kamala Harris took over the Democratic ticket in late July. Polling confirms that Harris has posted significant improvements among nonwhite voters, young voters, Democrats, and suburban voters. In other words, Harris has managed to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/harris-starting-rebuild-biden-coalition/story?id=112906250">revive</a> the party’s standing with its base, suggesting that a part of Trump’s gains were due to unique problems that Biden had with these groups of voters. Thus, it’s not entirely clear to what extent this great racial realignment, as <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23982907/trump-democrats-republicans-working-class-voters-latino-black-voters">some have described</a> the Trump-era phenomenon, will manifest itself in November.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Democrats aren’t in the clear. That same polling suggests that, despite Harris’s improvements, she is still <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/harris-starting-rebuild-biden-coalition/story?id=112906250">underperforming</a> both <a href="https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1831396109341839435">Biden’s support at this point in the 2020</a> polls and the <a href="https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1832957355518042396">margins of victory</a> Biden ended up winning on Election Day. These numbers, especially the results among Latino and Hispanic voters, should be worrisome to Democrats: Biden did rather poorly among Latino voters relative to other candidates from the current century, resulting in Trump posting numbers not seen by a Republican since George W. Bush ran for reelection in 2004, and Harris could perform even more poorly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why? Putting aside environmental factors and shifts in the American electorate that are happening independent of the candidates, there are a few theories to explain how Trump has uniquely weakened political polarization along the lines of race and ethnicity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">1) Trump has successfully associated himself with a message of economic nostalgia, heightening nonwhite Americans’ memories of the pre-Covid economy in contrast to the period of inflation we’re now exiting.</p>

<ol>
<li></li>
</ol>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2) Trump and his campaign have also zeroed in specifically on outreach and messaging to nonwhite men as part of their larger focus on appealing to male voters.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li></li>
</ol>

<p class="has-text-align-none">3) Trump and his party have taken advantage of a confluence of social factors, including messaging on immigration and cultural issues, to shore up support from conservative voters of color who have traditionally voted for Democrats or not voted at all.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li></li>
</ol>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theory 1: Effective campaigning on the economy</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s loudest message —&nbsp;the one that gets the most headlines —&nbsp;is his bombastic attacks on immigrants and his pledge to conduct mass deportations. His most successful appeal to voters, though, which he has held on to despite an improving economy under Biden, is economic. Trump claims to have presided over a time of broad and magnificent prosperity, arguing that there was a Trump economic renaissance before Biden bungled it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That pitch doesn’t comport with reality, but it may be resonating with voters who disproportionately prioritize economic concerns in casting their votes, particularly Latino and Asian American voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polling suggests that voters at large <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/14/us/politics/poll-trump-views.html">remember</a> the Trump-era economy fondly and view Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/04/us/politics/trump-biden-policies-help-hurt.html">policies</a> more <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/14/us/politics/poll-trump-views.html">favorably</a> than Biden’s. Black and Latino voters in particular may have more negative memories about Biden and Democrats’ economic stewardship because they <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/Research/Interactives/Data/equitable-growth-indicators/downloads/EGI-National-INFLATION.pdf?sc_lang=en&amp;hash=3523DCE63C4151B6A6347461000E2F7C">experienced worse rates of inflation</a> than white Americans and Asian Americans did during 2021 and 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those memories came up constantly on a recent Black Voters for Trump voter outreach swing this September through predominantly Black neighborhoods in Philadelphia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have got to get somebody in the White House that has been there, knows our economy, knows what a bad economy looks like, and will get us where we need to go,” Signa Griffin, who described herself as a Black Trump supporter living in Philadelphia, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sharita White, another Black voter planning to support Trump, said not enough people want to admit how much better life was when Trump was president. “They talk so bad about him, but they forgot what happened,” she said. “I don&#8217;t know too much about politics, but the only thing I know, my income changed, and if I need that man to get in here to fix my income, I&#8217;m all down.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polling suggests <a href="https://www.as-coa.org/articles/poll-tracker-latino-vote-2024-us-presidential-election">Hispanic</a> and <a href="https://aapidata.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-AAVS-Full-Report_July15.pdf">Asian American</a> voters are feeling economic concerns especially keenly, and Hispanic voters in particular seem primed for an economic pitch from Trump: More than half said they trusted Trump over Biden to “make good decisions about economic policy,” according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/07/19/how-latino-voters-view-the-2024-presidential-election/">research conducted by the Pew Research Center</a> this summer. It was the topic on which Trump had the biggest advantage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, Trump has long inflated his economic record and conveniently ignores the economic devastation he presided over during the Covid-19 pandemic and recession. That deflection provides an additional point that further complicates the blame Biden has received on the economy. Presidents, in general, have limited ability to control the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/upshot/presidents-have-less-power-over-the-economy-than-you-might-think.html">economy</a> (or <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/does-the-president-have-control-over-inflation">inflation)</a>, given the independence of the Federal Reserve and how interconnected our economy is with the world at large. But sour perceptions still helped drag down Biden’s approval rating and electoral support as a candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it hasn’t stopped Trump from making a big deal about the opportunities his administration secured for minority-owned small businesses&nbsp;—&nbsp;he talks about cutting regulations, providing emergency assistance during the pandemic, and keeping unemployment low.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/gettyimages-2171578427.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.150071006711,100,75.699857986579" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Former President Donald Trump speaks during an economy-focused campaign event at the Linda Ronstadt Music Hall in Tucson, Arizona, on September 12, 2024. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this resonates with Hispanic and Asian American communities, James Zarsadiaz, a professor of history and researcher on conservatism at the University of San Francisco, told me. “As [these entrepreneurs] feel the punch of inflation, fees, taxes to run a business in very expensive metro areas, the GOP is starting to look more attractive to them again because they’re seen as the party on the side of the small-business owner, as opposed to the Democrats who are seen as the party of protecting workers.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once again, things have changed since Harris became the nominee, and polls <a href="https://www.ft.com/ft-michigan-ross-poll">specifically focusing on economic sentiment</a> have tracked an improving national mood and growing trust in Harris’s ability to handle economic issues. But Trump is still benefiting from a sense of nostalgia&nbsp;and has tried his best to tie Harris to Biden’s economic record, asking voters routinely if they are better off today than they were four years ago.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theory 2: Direct appeals to nonwhite men</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The political realignment of women voters has been one of the major stories of 2024; the gender gap in American politics exploded in 2016, took a break in 2020, and seems like it&#8217;s about to be historic in 2024, with a huge pro-Democrat shift among women. At the same time, though, the rightward drift of men, including men of color, is a quiet undercurrent that may end up explaining what happened if Trump wins in November.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plenty of theories have been raised in the past about what kind of appeal Trump might have specifically to men and to men of color: Does his businessman persona resonate with upwardly mobile, financially aspirational men? Is there a “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/14/us/politics/trump-macho-appeal.html">macho</a>” appeal there for Hispanic men? Could his gritty, outsider, everyman posturing and brash rhetoric resonate with Black and Latino men, particularly those living in traditionally Democratic cities?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of those could play a factor, but more significantly, pre-Harris, Trump’s campaign and allies doubled down on <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-allies-launch-20-million-effort-to-reach-young-men-e65aeb31">reaching out to men</a>, especially <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/trump-stop-frisk-black-male-voters-rcna157084">men</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/us/politics/2024-election-gop-black-men-voters.html">of</a> <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/184638/trump-making-gains-latino-menand-harris-can-respond">color</a>, as part of an effort to exploit the growing gender gap and fuel disillusionment with Democrats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s the “Jamal and Enrique” strategy that the Trump campaign appears to believe in, that “for every Karen we lose, we’re going to win a Jamal and an Enrique,” as Trump allies <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-campain-election-2024-susie-wiles-chris-lacivita/678806/">explained it to the Atlantic’s Tim Alberta in July</a>. That includes speaking to, campaigning with, and getting endorsements from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/12/politics/video/gen-z-tiktok-politics-influencers-digvid">TikTok</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpcj0BRT31Q">stars</a>, <a href="https://time.com/7020074/dana-white-ufc-sphere-trump-interview/">sports</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrFdHO7FH8w">personalities</a>, and popular Black and Latin <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/puerto-rican-musicians-bring-star-power-endorse-trump-best-president-world-has-seen">musicians</a> who have large young male audiences.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/gettyimages-2153729329.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.737892056687,100,78.524215886627" alt="A man in a crowd shouting and wearing a red shirt that says “I was there” and features a the New York state outline and the words “Bronx, New York, Trump.“" title="A man in a crowd shouting and wearing a red shirt that says “I was there” and features a the New York state outline and the words “Bronx, New York, Trump.“" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Trump supporters outside of a Trump rally venue in the Bronx in May 2024. | Stephanie Keith/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Stephanie Keith/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Intentionally or otherwise, this strategy could exacerbate movement by traditionally Democratic constituencies that were already slipping. Among young <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/14/harris-needs-incredible-turnout-among-black-voters-but-there-are-warning-signs-00179211">Black</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/us/politics/asian-american-voters-election.html">Asian American</a>, and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/09/05/latino-youth-independent-voters-harris-trump-campaigns">Latino</a> men, loyalty to the Democratic Party has faded. Younger Latinos in general are more likely than older Latinos to <a href="https://unidosus.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/unidosus_latinosonthemove_partisanchurnandchangingvoterintentacrosscohorts.pdf">identify as independents</a>, and younger Latino men have tended to support Republican candidates at higher rates than young Latinas. An example: A <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-younger-voters-will-impact-elections-young-latino-voters-will-be-vital-to-the-outcome-of-the-2024-election/">Brookings analysis</a> of the 2022 midterms found Latinos under the age of 30 “supported Republican candidates for Congress (40%) at nearly double the rate of young Latinas (21%).” And Pew Research has routinely found that younger Black men are more likely to identify as <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/05/20/an-early-look-at-black-voters-views-on-biden-trump-and-election-2024/">Republicans</a> than <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/04/09/age-generational-cohorts-and-party-identification/">older Black men</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Theory 3: Championing conservative social issues</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and the GOP may also have found the right social issues to emphasize and campaign on in order to exploit some of the cultural divides between conservative and moderate nonwhite voters, and liberal white voters who also make up part of the Democratic base (in addition to liberal nonwhite voters). In 2021 and 2022, that looked like fearmongering on gender identity and crime, playing up concerns over affirmative action, and campaigning on the overturning of <em>Roe v Wade.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023 and 2024, the Trump focus has shifted strongly toward immigration, an issue that has divided the Democratic coalition as hostility toward immigration has grown. That’s true even for Latino and Hispanic voters — long seen as being the voting group most amenable to a pro-immigrant, Democratic message — and it’s being used as a wedge issue by Republicans among Black voters as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though it was seen as a gaffe, Trump’s “black jobs” comment during the first presidential debate got to this tension — the idea of migrants taking jobs, resources, and opportunities from non-white citizens. Florida Republican Rep. Byron Donalds, one of Trump’s go-to Black surrogates, explained the argument to me like this: “If you&#8217;re a Black man, Hispanic man, white man, you&#8217;re working hard every day, and the money you earn doesn&#8217;t go as far. That hurts your family, that hurts your kids. So they look at this situation, this immigration problem. People are saying, ‘Wait a minute. Why are illegal aliens getting food, getting shelter, getting an education, while my family and my child is struggling. It&#8217;s not right, and it&#8217;s not fair.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And for Asian American voters, now the fastest growing ethnic segment of the electorate, immigration is also becoming a wedge issue, Zarsadiaz told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This feeling, ‘I’ve waited my turn, I waited my time’ — there’s long been Latino and Asian American immigrants who have felt this way. The assumption has long been that if you’re an immigrant, you must be very liberal on immigration, and that’s definitely not the case,” Zarsadiaz said. “Some of the staunchest critics of immigration, especially on amnesty or Dreamers, are immigrants themselves, and with Asian Americans that’s an issue that has been drawing more voters to Trump and Trumpism —&nbsp;those immigrant voters who feel like they’re being wronged.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats are now <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/369177/democrats-kamala-harris-truce-immigration-progressive-border-security">moderating on immigration</a>, but only after years of moving left. And that shift left has been true on a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-democrats-have-shifted-left-over-the-last-30-years/">range of issues</a>, contributing to another part of this theory of Trump’s gains: that Democrats have pushed conservative or moderate nonwhite Americans away as they embraced beliefs more popular with white, college-educated, and suburban voters. The political scientist Ruy Teixeira and Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1NODGmUk5nRWpnu3ks3leg">have</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/11/04/new-republican-party-working-class-coalition-00122822">been</a> <a href="https://www.liberalpatriot.com/p/revisiting-the-three-point-plan-to">theorizing</a> for a while now that a disjuncture over social issues in general — and Trump’s seizure of these issues —&nbsp;has complicated the idea that Democrats would benefit from greater numbers and rates of participation from nonwhite America. It may explain why conservative and moderate voters of color, who may have voted for Democrats in the past, are now <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24091684/democrats-latino-voters-trump-biden-polling">realigning</a> with the Republican Party.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Don’t forget the non-Trump factors</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These three theories try to describe how Trump specifically has been able to improve his and the GOP’s standing among a growing segment of the American electorate. They place Trump as the central cause for the majority of this racial political shift. But would these dynamics still be happening if he weren’t involved?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are signs that some of this shift may be happening independently of Trump. It could be a product of the growing diversification of America, upward mobility and changing understandings of class, and growing educational divides.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, as rates of immigration change and the share of US-born Latino and Asian Americans grows, their partisan loyalties may continue to change. Those born closer to the immigrant experience may have had more of a willingness to back the party seen as more welcoming of immigrants, but as generations get further away from that experience, racial and ethnic identity may become less of a factor in the development of political thinking.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Concepts of racial identity and memory are also changing — younger Black Americans, for example, have less of a tie to the Civil Rights era — potentially contributing to less strong political polarization among Black and Latino people in the US independently of any given candidate — and creating more persuadable voters in future elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, younger generations are increasingly identifying as independents or outside of the two-party paradigm —&nbsp;a change in loyalty that stands to hurt Democrats first, since Democrats tend to do better with younger voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless of whether Trump just happens to be the right kind of populist at the right time of racial and ethnic change in America or if he’s a unique accelerator and contributor to the changes America is experiencing, November may offer more evidence that something has fundamentally changed in US politics. As America diversifies, it makes sense for its political parties to diversify too — and that poses a reckoning for Democrats in elections to come.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since it unexpectedly became a viral phenomenon earlier this year, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a> has loomed extraordinarily large over the presidential campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the debate stage, Kamala Harris <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542">called it</a> “a detailed and dangerous plan” that Donald Trump “intends on implementing if he were elected again.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, meanwhile, insists we should pay no attention to that <a href="https://static.project2025.org/2025_MandateForLeadership_FULL.pdf">922-page policy plan</a> behind the curtain, claiming that he has “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542">nothing to do</a>” with it and has “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html">no idea</a> who is behind” it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In reality, Project 2025, an initiative put together last year by the right-wing Heritage Foundation to plan for the next GOP administration, was shaped by longtime <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/08/07/trump-heritage-project-2025-roberts/">close allies</a> of Trump. Detailed planning for a second Trump term agenda along these lines is very real, and though the Project 2025 initiative itself has seemingly <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/08/02/project-2025-trump-inside-story-00172299">fizzled out</a>, other <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/20/us/politics/trump-conservative-partnership-institute.html">groups</a> have <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/07/22/inside-the-trump-plan-for-2025">picked</a> up the slack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Furthermore, many of Project 2025’s key proposals — to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce#:~:text=along%20these%20lines.-,1)%20Concentrating%20power%20in%20the%20presidency,-%3A%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20allies%20believe">centralize presidential power</a>, crack down on <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce#:~:text=surprise%20medical%20billing-,Immigration,-%3A%20Deny%20loan">unauthorized immigrants</a>, deprioritize <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce#:~:text=Energy%20and%20environment%3A">fighting climate change</a>, and eliminate the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/politics/department-of-education-shut-down-trump/index.html">Department of Education</a> — are fully and openly supported by Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Trump’s intentions are less clear on a vitally important issue where Project 2025 made some particularly extreme proposals: abortion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The project’s plan called for using presidential power to aggressively restrict abortions in several ways. Trump, wary of these proposals’ unpopularity, has said during the campaign that he <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/trump-comstock-enforcement-00175068">won’t support</a> some of them. He also evidently <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/29/g-s1-20187/trump-abortion-amendment-4-florida-ivf-funding-reproductive-rights">feels hesitant</a> to outright disavow the social conservatives who have long been a key part of his base.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris, meanwhile, wants to associate Trump with the most extreme version of the conservative anti-abortion agenda. “Understand in his Project 2025 there would be a national abortion ban,” she <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-trump-presidential-debate-transcript/story?id=113560542">said at the debate</a>. That isn’t strictly true, in that the project does not call for any explicit&nbsp; ban, but it does include a proposal that some experts say could lead to a “<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-sweeping-consequences-of-the-far-rights-plan-to-effectuate-a-backdoor-national-abortion-ban-in-project-2025/">backdoor abortion ban</a>,” depending on how it is implemented. Furthermore, it is certainly true that anti-abortion activists got key appointments in Trump’s administration last time and expect to score such appointments again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, Trump is caught between his fear of electoral defeat if he backs social conservatives’ unpopular ideas and his desire to reward their loyalty to him and keep them by his side. That explains Trump’s delicate dance in which he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html">says</a> Project 2025 has some “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal” ideas but never quite specifies what those bad ideas are, since doing so might make his supporters angry.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If he wins, the question will be whether Trump feels freed up to reward his longtime allies with control over federal abortion policy, much as he did last time around when he appointed the Supreme Court justices who overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Project 2025 has a sweeping set of proposals designed to restrict abortion in the United States</h2>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2164096734_904ea6.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.72998978273,100,78.540020434539" alt="People stand talking in and around a Project 2025 banner and table bearing books in a convention center." title="People stand talking in and around a Project 2025 banner and table bearing books in a convention center." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The Heritage Foundation&#039;s Project 2025 booth at the National Conservative Conference in Washington, DC, on July 8, 2024. | Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Dominic Gwinn/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">While Trump may not have been personally involved in Project 2025, much of it was clearly written in the hope of appealing to him. The group’s key policy document conspicuously avoids taking sides on key issues where Trump has broken with conservative dogma, like trade and the future of Social Security and Medicare.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the one issue where they really got out in front of Trump, it seems, is abortion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Project 2025’s policy plan was put together in the months after the Supreme Court achieved social conservatives’ long-held priority of overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. The anti-abortion movement, though, does not want to stop with returning abortion policy to the states. It argues that abortion should be understood as the murder of unborn children, and it wants to use federal power to cut down further on abortions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Conservatives in the states and in Washington, including in the next conservative Administration, should push as hard as possible to protect the unborn in every jurisdiction in America,” Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/362917/jd-vance-project-2025-book-kevin-roberts-trump">wrote in the foreword</a> to Project 2025’s policy plan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plan recommends many anti-abortion policies, but three in particular stand out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>1) Enforcing the Comstock Act</strong>: Project 2025 calls for prosecuting “providers and distributors of abortion pills that use the mail,” via an old anti-obscenity law called the Comstock Act — a law that, my colleague Ian Millhiser <a href="https://www.vox.com/abortion/351678/the-comstock-act-the-long-dead-law-trump-could-use-to-ban-abortion-explained">writes</a>, “has not been seriously enforced for nearly a century.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reproductive rights activists <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/reproductive-freedom/anti-abortion-extremists-want-to-use-the-150-year-old-comstock-act-to-ban-abortion-nationwide">have warned</a>, with alarm, that the Comstock Act could be used to enforce “a backdoor abortion ban” nationally. That’s because the very broad law says it’s illegal to send not only any pill, but any “thing designed, adapted, or intended for producing abortion” through the mail or across state lines in interstate commerce. If it is seriously enforced, they argue, it would be effectively illegal to send abortion clinics basic supplies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If the Comstock Act were being enforced, it would preempt state laws that protect abortion rights, and states that have ballot initiatives, and states that have other protective legislation,” UC Davis law professor Mary Ziegler <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/04/trump-could-use-the-1873-comstock-act-to-ban-abortion-nationwide-heres-how-mary-ziegler/">told Mother Jones</a> in April.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some anti-abortion activists have a similar interpretation. “We don’t need a federal ban when we have Comstock on the books,” Jonathan Mitchell, an influential conservative lawyer (who <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/02/08/trump-lawyer-arguments-supreme-court-00140604">represented Trump</a> in one legal proceeding), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/trump-allies-abortion-restrictions.html">told the New York Times</a> in February. But, he added, “the extent to which that’s done will depend on whether the president wants to take the political heat and whether the attorney general or the secretary of Health and Human Services are on board.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>2) Banning the abortion pill mifepristone: </strong>Asserting that “abortion pills pose the single greatest threat to unborn children in a post-Roe world,” Project 2025 calls for revoking FDA approval of the pill mifepristone, which <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/21/24105984/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-pills-fda-alliance-hippocratic-medicine">is used</a> in about half of US abortions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because mifepristone has been under legal challenge, many abortion providers have prepared for such a ban and said they can switch to a different regimen requiring only the drug misoprostol. But they fear that drug would become the next target of anti-abortion activists, as <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/25/1240282129/mifepristone-supreme-court-fda-medication-abortion-explainer">NPR’s Selena Simmons-Duffin wrote</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>3) Demanding data from states on who is getting abortions:</strong> Complaining that liberal states are “sanctuaries for abortion tourism” (because red state residents can travel there for the procedure), Project 2025 says that HHS needs to ensure every state reports to the feds “exactly how many abortions take place within its borders,” including data such as “the mother’s state of residence.” The document recommends cutting federal funds to states if they refuse to provide this data.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trump just can’t seem to quit anti-abortion activists</h2>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1258598639.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A woman holds a pro-life sign as she listen to Trump speak in Greensboro, North Carolina, on June 10, 2023. | Allison Joyce/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Allison Joyce/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s those above proposals from Project 2025 that have proved so politically inconvenient for Trump during this campaign. He has sounded the refrain that he merely wants to let states decide on abortion policy, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/20/trump-comstock-enforcement-00175068">saying</a> “the federal government should have nothing to do with this issue.” But he also constantly promises that new details on his intentions for federal policy are forthcoming — details that somehow never arrive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked last month about enforcing the Comstock Act, Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmfGRdlBq38&amp;t=342s">seemed to say</a> he wouldn’t, but he did&nbsp;hedge a bit: “No, we will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no.” On banning mifepristone, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/08/trump-abortion-pill-mifepristone-news-conference/">Trump campaign’s line</a> is that the Supreme Court has settled the matter — which makes no sense because the court merely <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/355175/supreme-court-mifepristone-abortion-alliiance-hippocratic-medicine-fda">ruled on a procedural issue</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So Trump is claiming women will have nothing to fear from his abortion policies if he wins. But there are many reasons to wonder whether to believe him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality is that some of Trump’s most important political allies are people deeply committed to restricting abortion in the United States. Take, for instance, his vice presidential nominee, JD Vance. In 2022, Vance called for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2024/07/17/jd-vance-abortion-comstock-vice-presidential-nominee/">enforcing the Comstock Act</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/kfile-jd-vance-abortion-comments/index.html">said</a>: “I certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump&#8217;s key appointees who’d be tasked with setting federal policy in his second term would also likely include many committed social conservatives. Notably, the chapters of Project 2025 that touch on abortion were written by two important Trump administration officials: Roger Severino, who served in the Department of Health and Human Services, and Gene Hamilton, who served in the Justice Department (and is a longtime close ally of Trump policy guru Stephen Miller).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump “had the most pro-life administration in history and adopted the most pro-life policies of any administration in history,” Severino <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/17/us/politics/trump-allies-abortion-restrictions.html">told the New York Times in February</a>. “That track record is the best evidence, I think, you could have of what a second term might look like if Trump wins.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/06/books/books-of-the-times-the-art-of-political-relationships.html">classic political saying</a>, “Dance with the one that brung ya,” explaining why politicians feel compelled to stick with their loyal supporters. While Trump may be currently trying to strike a more moderate tone on abortion, he is a transactional person and he knows that social conservatives are among his most important and loyal supporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was demonstrated at the end of August: After several days in which Trump had taken heat from anti-abortion groups, he announced that, on a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/29/g-s1-20187/trump-abortion-amendment-4-florida-ivf-funding-reproductive-rights">Florida abortion ballot measure</a>, he’d stand with them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that the dust has settled after the first and perhaps only <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370958/harris-trump-debate-winners-losers">presidential debate</a> between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the state of the polling looks clear: Harris has a slight edge in a race that remains extremely close.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris leads national polls, on average, by 2 or 3 percentage points. More importantly, she leads in the key Electoral College states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania by 1 to 2 points in recent polling averages. And if she wins all three, that would be just enough to give her the presidency (so long as she holds onto the other blue states, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/4/3/24119984/nebraska-electoral-college-vote-trump-biden-kirk">Nebraska’s Second District</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s important to remember that a 1 or 2 point lead in polling averages is not a safe or reliable lead. A polling error underestimating Trump in these states — of the sort that occurred in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2021/03/02/what-2020s-election-poll-errors-tell-us-about-the-accuracy-of-issue-polling/">2016 or 2020</a> — could send Harris to defeat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the other swing states: Nevada has had few high-quality polls since the debate, but the averages currently show a very close race, with Harris leading by a point or less. But Trump has a slight lead — 2 points or less — in the averages for North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The big picture, though, is that all seven of the swing states are close enough in polls that they could easily go to either candidate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The New York Times/Siena polls have shown some unusual results</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the news for Harris in post-debate polling has generally been good, some results from the New York Times/Siena College polls tell a more complicated story.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This polling <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/upshot/harris-trump-poll-pennsylvania.html">found</a> Harris up by 4 points in Pennsylvania, the most important swing state, which is fantastic for her. But it also showed a tied race nationally — and larger than average <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/upshot/trump-harris-sun-belt-polls.html">Trump leads</a> in North Carolina (3 points), Georgia (4 points), and Arizona (5 points).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Typically, the best practice for looking at campaign polling is to throw it all into an average, since any one pollster’s results could be an outlier. But the Times polls are highly respected in political circles, so it may be worth contemplating what it would mean for the race if their recent polls turned out to be accurate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One takeaway is that though those polls are generally worse for Harris, the Pennsylvania result is actually quite good — better than average. Overall, the Keystone State polling has not looked great for Harris since she entered the race, leading to <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/pennsylvania-may-be-a-problem-for">many</a> takes <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-does-the-harris-walz-campaign-solve-a-problem-like-pennsylvania-gov-josh-shapiro">about</a> her purported Pennsylvania “problem,” <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4869398-harris-shapiro-walz-trump-nate-silver/">second-guessing</a> about whether she should have picked the state’s governor, Josh Shapiro, as her running mate, and a belief that the Electoral College math gives Trump an advantage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Times polls, however, essentially point to a parallel world in which Electoral College bias doesn’t help Trump, and may even help Harris significantly. The Times has not polled Wisconsin or Michigan this month, but their polling of the states last month showed Harris up in those states — and in Pennsylvania — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/us/politics/harris-trump-battleground-polls.html">by 4</a> points.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why would this be the case? Nate Cohn, the Times’ chief political analyst, has actually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/11/upshot/electoral-college-trump-2024.html">written since last year</a> that Trump’s Electoral College edge might be fading. That could be because Republicans have gained ground in heavily blue states, like New York, but they’re still nowhere close to actually flipping those states — while Democrats have held on in the battleground states. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23451416/democrats-win-midterms-blue-red-new-york-elections">2022 midterm results</a> appear to be consistent with such a theory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Biden in 2020, the decisive Electoral College state was Wisconsin, but his margin was nearly 4 points worse there than his national margin, a serious gap. For Harris this time around, polling averages have tended to show a smaller disadvantage — but they have typically shown her performing a bit worse in the pivotal state, Pennsylvania, than she does nationally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Times polling is unusual, though, in implying that the bias may go in the other direction this time around; that the Electoral College might actually <em>help</em> Harris. For now, this is an outlier result, but it’s certainly an interesting scenario.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A less encouraging takeaway for Harris if the Times polls are accurate is that Trump has the advantage in Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina. Other pollsters have also typically shown Trump with a narrow edge in those states, but the Times polls may be ominous, showing him with a 3-5 point advantage in them all, just after Harris’s well-received debate performance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If those states prove out of reach for Harris, she’ll be stuck relying on Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan as her only path to victory — the same “blue wall” Hillary Clinton hoped in vain would save her in 2016. Winning them, but not the other swing states, would put Harris at the narrowest possible 270 to 268 Electoral College victory. What could go wrong?</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">The upcoming execution of a 55-year-old Missouri man — who maintains he is innocent — is the latest of several <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/25/24050932/alabama-nitrogen-gas-execution-death-penalty">recent cases</a> to renew scrutiny of the death penalty. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2001, Marcellus Williams was convicted of the 1998 killing of social worker and former St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter Felicia “Lisha” Gayle, and sentenced to death. Since his sentencing, questions have been raised about how evidence in the case was handled and whether jury selection for his trial was fair. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given these concerns, and Williams’s continued claims that he did not kill Gayle, he and St. Louis prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell have called for the state to <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/court-denies-prosecutors-motion-to-vacate-marcellus-williams-conviction-and-death-sentence/" data-type="link" data-id="https://innocenceproject.org/court-denies-prosecutors-motion-to-vacate-marcellus-williams-conviction-and-death-sentence/">vacate his conviction</a>. While his execution was previously delayed twice before, the Missouri governor and state Supreme Court have declined to do so again this past week. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those decisions, and the outstanding uncertainty in Williams’s case, have put a new spotlight on capital punishment<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.aclu.org/documents/case-against-death-penalty">and many problems that have been cited with it</a>. Barring any action by the US Supreme Court, Williams is scheduled to be killed via lethal injection on Tuesday evening. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the new developments in Williams’s case?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Williams was convicted for Gayle’s murder based on the testimony of two witnesses, including his girlfriend at the time, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/missouri-execution-marcellus-williams-supreme-court-de47c99e00bb620db9db702f5f7e2ee8">who said she saw</a> the victim’s purse and laptop in his car. Williams was incarcerated at the time of his conviction in the Gayle case, and his then-cellmate Henry Cole also claimed that Williams had admitted to the killing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Williams’s counsel argues that both witnesses had other motives for singling him out, including “reward money and a bargain for shorter sentences in their own criminal cases,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/24/marcellus-williams-execution-missouri-faq/">according to the Washington Post.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/23/missouri-execution-marcellus-williams-death-row/75194051007/">As USA Today notes</a>, there wasn’t forensic evidence linking Williams to the crime, and <a href="https://capitalbnews.org/missouri-marcellus-williams-death-row-dna-evidence/">his DNA was not found on the murder weapon</a> — a knife.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since his conviction, Williams’s counsel has called for greater investigation of the DNA that was on the knife, as well as a review of racial bias in the jury selection process. <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/missouri-set-to-execute-marcellus-williams-despite-pleas-from-victims-fam-and-prosecutors">Gayle’s family has also backed clemency</a> and the possibility of a life sentence without parole. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Previously, Williams’s counsel convinced former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens that new testing of the DNA evidence, which included DNA from another man, had the potential to exonerate him. That led Greitens to grant a stay of execution in 2017 and to convene a panel to investigate this evidence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Attorneys have since learned, though, that the knife had fingerprints and DNA from a prosecutor who had touched the murder weapon without wearing gloves, contaminating the evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Williams’ allies have also argued he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/missouri-execution-marcellus-williams-supreme-court-de47c99e00bb620db9db702f5f7e2ee8">faced racial bias in his trial</a> after a former prosecutor said he removed a Black juror because of his resemblance to Williams.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Williams’ attorneys have called on the US Supreme Court to grant a stay of the execution due to this evidence of bias. But it’s not yet clear if the Court will. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Missouri Supreme Court had declined to do so, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawyers-seek-supreme-court-intervention-hours-missouri-inmates-113961065#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDespite%20nearly%20a%20quarter%20century,Court%20Judge%20Zel%20Fischer%20wrote." data-type="link" data-id="https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawyers-seek-supreme-court-intervention-hours-missouri-inmates-113961065#:~:text=%E2%80%9CDespite%20nearly%20a%20quarter%20century,Court%20Judge%20Zel%20Fischer%20wrote.">with Judge Zel Fischer citing</a> “no credible evidence of actual innocence or any showing of a constitutional error undermining confidence in the original judgment.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What concerns does this raise about capital punishment?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The use of capital punishment has waned in recent years as concerns about how <a href="https://www.aclu.org/documents/death-penalty-questions-and-answers#:~:text=Q%3A%20Doesn%E2%80%99t%20the%20Death,than%20states%20without%20such%20laws.">well it works as a deterrent</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/25/24050932/alabama-nitrogen-gas-execution-death-penalty">how humane it is, and racial disparities in death sentences</a> have grown. <a href="https://www.nacdl.org/Content/Race-and-the-Death-Penalty">According to one 2016 study</a> in Washington State, Black defendants are four times more likely to be sentenced to death than non-Black defendants in similar circumstances.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although 27 states still allow the death penalty, 14 of those have not conducted any executions in the past 10 years, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/06/us/us-executions-death-penalty-dg/index.html">according to CNN</a>. Executions have also dwindled since 1999, which marked a recent high when nearly 100 people were killed. In 2023, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/06/us/us-executions-death-penalty-dg/index.html">24 people were executed across five states</a>; currently, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/23/missouri-execution-marcellus-williams-death-row/75194051007/">24 people are expected to be executed this year</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the concerns raised by executions is the fear that innocent people could face these sentences. Williams’s team is adamant that his case is an example of this issue. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Missouri is poised to execute an innocent man, an outcome that calls into question the legitimacy of the entire criminal justice system,” Tricia Bushnell, a Midwest Innocence Project attorney representing Williams, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bEqZFYntcV03ld6Lf_Rjf9v2q8tJzqLB/edit">said in a statement</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/policy-issues/innocence">According to the Death Penalty Information Center,</a> at least 200 people who were wrongly convicted and sentenced to death have been exonerated since 1973. <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/innocence-and-the-death-penalty/">And per a 2014 study estimate</a>, roughly 4 percent of the people sentenced to death are innocent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Having devoted fans can be a terrifying and fraught thing for a public figure to experience — and increasingly, the celebs are telling us about it. The latest round of toxic fandom discourse arguably started with Chappell Roan, who made headlines in August for <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/chappell-roan-blasts-invasive-fans-in-tiktok-rant">speaking out</a> against her own fans, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chappellroan/video/7404955808980667690">elaborating</a> in a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chappellroan/video/7404957266853645611">pair of TikToks</a> about fan harassment, stalking, inappropriate behavior, and bullying.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t care that abuse and harassment, stalking, whatever, is a normal thing to do to people who are famous or a little famous,” the “Good Luck Babe” singer said. “I don’t care that it’s normal; I don’t care that this crazy type of behavior comes along with the job, this career field that I’ve chosen. That does not make it okay. That does not make it normal. It doesn’t mean that I want it; it doesn’t mean that I like it.” She’s clearly not alone: The sheer number of celebrities who’ve either spoken out publicly or reached out privately in support of Roan after her TikTok rant is huge, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-lady-gaga-support-elton-john-mitski-1235099773/">a range of high-profile stars</a> from Katy Perry to Lady Gaga, from <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jewel/video/7409675347974720799?">Jewel</a> to Elton John.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Roan is describing here is an increasing trend around the globe. Fandom has changed over the last decade to become more of a discourse, but while celebs have had to hear more and more of what fans have to say, now fans are getting a peek at what their actions mean to their favorite stars — and a lot of it is not so flattering. It’s unclear whether the celebrities’ pushback is making the situation better or if their protests will ever reach the most entitled fans and paparazzi — those for whom celebrities are less like people and more like collectible Pokémon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this suggests that Chappell Roan’s fans, and even her paparazzi, aren’t the problem: It’s the increasingly toxic nature of celebrity fandom itself.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, fans stalking and harassing celebrities is nothing new, and thanks to the rise of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23733213/fandom-purity-culture-what-is-proship-antiship-antifandom">anti-fandoms</a>, it’s possible to make hating a creator your full-time fannish hobby alongside legions of other haters, all without regard for how the person behind the persona might suffer as a result. What seems to be new, however, is that more and more frequently, the celebrities are defending themselves — openly calling out bad fan and paparazzi behavior in real time, and more publicly calling out the toxicity that leads to that behavior.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The onus is typically on celebrities to maintain their calm in the face of outlandish behavior from fans and paparazzi, no matter how out of hand things get. In August, when Justin Bieber lost his cool and rebuked a group of teens who’d been harassing him at a hotel, asking them, “Is this funny to you guys?” TMZ <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/09/justin-bieber-yell-teens-hotel/">framed the scene</a> as “Bieber freaks out on a bunch of young kids.” The tabloid <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13729485/Justin-Bieber-yells-teenagers-viral-video.html">slant</a> was that Bieber was temperamental, even though the group of teens <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tuscanciones150/video/7401849318472240417">appeared to swarm him</a>, phones out, and even though Bieber never raised his voice. The singer <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nojumper/video/6978301532500446469">previously</a> had to tell a group of fans, again very calmly, not to stalk him at his home — this after <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/every-time-justin-bieber-had-151000160.html">years</a> of scary stalking incidents, including fans breaking into his hotel rooms and getting arrested outside of his house.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes the celebrity’s reaction in the face of fan harassment seems to be similar to that of an abuse victim. <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/12/28/18156266/2018-tv-good-place-crazy-ex-girlfriend-queer-eye"><em>Queer Eye</em></a>’s Jonathan Van Ness <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/morgansloss1/jonathan-van-ness-27-questions-interview">told BuzzFeed</a> in 2022 that when a fan literally ran up behind him in order to tackle-hug him, his response was to apologize <em>to her</em>: “I&#8217;m sorry I tried to attack you. We’re friends, right? Do you wanna take a selfie?&#8221; With that level of ingrained passive conditioning to overcome, it’s no wonder many celebrities applauded Roan for speaking out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might think a few extreme fans are causing most of the issues. The real problem, though, is messier. Modern fan culture has shifted away from worshiping aloof, unavailable Hollywood divas from afar and toward complex&nbsp; entanglements between fans and the people they stan.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This shift arguably began in the late aughts within <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/21258262/k-pop-essential-playlist-guide-for-beginners">K-pop fandom</a>, which is its own complicated ouroboros of pop stardom and standom, and within grassroots fandoms on YouTube and later Twitch. In those online spaces, amateur gamers and streamers who hit it big often had zero media training and zero preparation for how to deal with their new fame and the devotees that came with it. They typically interacted with their fans as though they were their friends — sometimes with <a href="https://ida.mtholyoke.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/39def074-5d5a-4c4c-9b20-c09d6477a910/content">extremely complicated</a> and even <a href="https://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/local/south-jersey/2016/12/18/forgotten-story-christina-grimmie-and-man-who-killed-her/95585040/">deeply tragic</a> results.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then came the advent of social media, which made celebrities even more accessible and gave fans with extreme tendencies even more ways to connect and mobilize en masse. These days, it’s no longer just about the mythical stalker fan, lurking in the dark, with clear, if poorly understood, intentions to do harm. Fans stalk celebrities openly, proactively, and proudly, often fully rejecting the idea that what they’re doing is wrong or causing their fave serious discomfort. In recent years, celebrities including <a href="https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/celebrity/john-cena-filmed-fan-jake-paul-podcast-294876-20240125">John Cena</a> and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/mitski-asks-fans-to-stop-filming-entire-songs-or-whole-sets-at-her-shows-3169422">Mitski</a> have asked fans to stop filming them, with Mitski claiming the experience of having to perform for a sea of phones makes them feel as though they’re being “consumed as content.” The fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indieheads/comments/t16126/mitski_asks_fans_to_stop_filming_entire_songs_or/">may or may not comply</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In many cases, even the idea that an actor could be someone else outside of their professional persona<strong> </strong>is a cause of tension among fans, one that celebrities have to grapple with and learn how to reconcile. It’s by no means only “extreme” fans who fall prey to this level of entitled thinking. Think how many normal people on the internet were emotionally invested in <a href="https://www.vox.com/22663143/john-mulaney-olivia-munn-pregnant-parasocial-relationships-kylie-jenner">John Mulaney’s divorce</a> or the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23387679/cheating-scandals-adam-levine-nia-long-try-guys-ned-fulmer">Try Guys scandal</a>, or <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/351720/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-bennifer-timeline-divorce-rumors">the roller coaster that was (is? was?) Bennifer</a>. These media narratives play out the way they do precisely because so many normal people feel an intense amount of ownership over the lives of these people we’ve never met,and a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-commentary/timothee-chalamet-kylie-jenner-club-chalamet-stan-culture-controversy-1234820673/">deep resistance</a> to anything that contradicts the narrative or the persona we’ve bought into. (<a href="https://www.vox.com/21337354/folklore-taylor-swift-kaylor-betty-gay-lesbian-subtext">Gaylors</a>, none of us are free from sin!)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be fair to the fans, they don’t always reach this stage on their own; they often experience tacit, perhaps unwitting, encouragement from the celebrities, or at least their PR teams. Sometimes celebrities will subtly lean into the ever-blurring lines of their parasocial relationships with their fanbases, usually in furtherance of marketing and promotion. Witness Jin, the oldest member of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/6/13/17426350/bts-history-members-explained">Korean mega-band BTS</a>, bizarrely having to give <a href="https://www.wvtm13.com/article/k-pop-star-hugs-fans-after-completing-mandatory-military-service/61092464">1,000 hugs to 1,000 fans</a> upon his exit from his mandatory military service earlier this year. Or see, for instance, the entire Swiftie <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23149181/taylor-swift-dance-party">ecosystem</a>, which arguably <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/9/16598106/taylor-swift-reputation-intimacy-control">depends upon</a> Taylor Swift being as obsessed with her fans, or at least with their opinions, as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/4/10/23677713/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-breakup-why">they are with her</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet this lean-in comes with blowback for the celebrity as well as the fan because they have to live not only with the socially constructed persona they helped create, but with the attitudes of the fans who’ve decided they adore that persona. Once that genie is out, there’s no putting it back in the bottle. “I just wanted to humbly welcome you to the shittiest exclusive club in the world,” an email from Mitski to Roan <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-lady-gaga-support-elton-john-mitski-1235099773/">reportedly read</a>, “the club where strangers think you belong to them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Mitski is describing here is essentially the academic concept of the celebrity as a “<a href="https://litlab.stanford.edu/star-texts/">star text</a>” — when a celebrity persona occupies a socially constructed role that evolves independently from them, based on how they behave, how the public interprets that behavior, and the cultural narrative that might attach to that behavior. As I’ve <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/7/10/21315905/vox-book-club-rodham-week-1-political-fanfiction-rpf">previously argued</a>, every celebrity exists both as themselves and as the symbol, or the “star text,” that they represent, and very rarely is that text within any celebrity’s ability to control or corral.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result of this sticky interdependence is an increase in fans feeling entitled to pieces of their celebrities’ lives, and sometimes physically entitled to the celebrities themselves, whether it be through stalking, harassment, refusal to stop filming them, or getting handsy and wildly inappropriate. It’s no secret, and certainly nothing new, that in many intense celebrity fandoms, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68572668">fans seek to control and direct</a> their favorite stars’ private lives, even to the extent of shaming them and performing backlash against them when they try to have lives of their own outside of their public personas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To some extent, we all form opinions and even judgments about high-profile people, and those people — at least the ones who’ve been properly media trained — know we do this and prepare for it. The evolving dynamics of fandom are constantly eroding current fandom etiquette and normative behavior, arguably faster than the celebs’ ability to adapt and adjust. What to do, for example, when fans <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/people-culture/china-personalities/article/3251212/crazed-china-fans-warned-famous-china-actor-stop-booking-flights-him-amid-rising-trend-devotees">change your flight information</a> or attempt to book a seat next to you on a plane? What to do when fans form <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23150487/zhang-zhehan-deepfake-fandom-conspiracy-theory">increasingly bizarre</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/18/11384118/larry-stylinson-one-direction-conspiracy-theory">conspiracy theories</a> that distort their sense of what’s real, all so they can maintain their collective narratives in the face of opposing information?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These mentalities don’t form in a vacuum, but rather within environments where fans cease to see idols as real people and begin to see them as commodities or as narratives in which they have invested — narratives that must be maintained at all cost. The economy of celebrity-stalking rewards fans and paparazzi for <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/trends/mumbai-beggars-tip-paparazzi-on-celebrity-locations-reveals-varinder-chawla-during-ask-me-anything-on-reddit-11718967312667.html">being as invasive as possible</a>. They can also be <a href="https://exiledfan.substack.com/p/the-rise-of-the-stalker-fan">terrifyingly organized</a> in their methods, relying on one another for resources, intel, and access. For the celebrity, this kind of constant fan scrutiny and entitlement can prove too much to handle — at least not without an <a href="https://www.asiaone.com/entertainment/any-morals-chinese-idol-wang-junkai-rages-paparazzi-causing-chaos-airport-xiao-zhan">occasional outburst</a> or show of resistance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s tempting to wonder what, if anything, can be done to curb this kind of intense and pervasive level of fandom — especially when it seems to be creeping into all aspects of society, from <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24043045/politics-fandom-trump-fans-toxic-stan-culture-conspiracies">politics</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23733213/fandom-purity-culture-what-is-proship-antiship-antifandom">personal aesthetics</a>. For now, Roan may have found the answer, and it seems to be very similar to the recent tactics used by the left to emphasize how far outside the norm are the extreme political views of their opponents: <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/365833/trump-harris-walz-weird-2024-election-voters-biden-poll-attack-messaging">Call them really weird</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t give a fuck if you think it’s selfish of me to say no for a photo or for your time or for a hug,” Roan <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chappellroan/video/7404955808980667690">said</a> in her first TikTok post. “That’s not normal. That’s weird. It’s weird how people think that you know a person just because you see them online and you listen to the art they make. That’s fucking weird! I’m allowed to say no to creepy behavior, okay?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the public and celebrity support for Roan is any indication, there may be more to come where that came from, and celebrities finally saying “no” to their fans can arguably only be a net gain for everyone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the next seven weeks until Election Day, the <em>Today, Explained</em> podcast will examine the major themes of the 2024 election by looking at each of the seven swing states. We’ll hear from voters in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, and North Carolina, and dive deep into topics like abortion, the concerns of rural voters, and economic stressors for retirees and Latino voters. We’re kicking it off with Georgia, where “election security” efforts are once again at the forefront for officials and voters alike. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For months, Georgia’s highest-ranking Republican leaders have been speaking out against an obscure, unelected board that has passed a series of controversial rule changes that could make it harder to know who won the state in the likely event of a close race, and facilitate attempts to dispute the election results.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <a href="https://www.wabe.org/lawsuit-challenges-georgias-new-election-certification-rules/">WABE reporter Sam Gringlas</a>, one rule allows local election board members to prevent votes from being counted at precincts if board members identify discrepancies, pending an investigation. And if the board members believe the error cannot be corrected, the board “shall determine a method to compute the votes justly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgia Secretary of State <a href="https://x.com/GaSecofState">Brad Raffensperger</a> has said <a href="https://www.wabe.org/georgia-election-board-approves-another-rule-that-could-disrupt-certification/">rule changes to the certification process</a> that have been advanced by the board are <a href="https://sos.ga.gov/news/raffensperger-defends-georgias-election-integrity-act-last-minute-changes-delaying-election">“misguided” and “will delay election results.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What they’re talking about is breaking open the ballot boxes,” Raffensperger <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/nx-s1-5103833/when-will-we-know-who-won-georgia-raffensperger-says-it-depends-on-how-close-it-is">told NPR’s Mary Louise Kelly</a> last week in an interview about new rules that allow local election board members to review massive amounts of documents before certifying election results. “Instead of [counting votes] in a secure warehouse and under the observation of the county election director … it would be happening at the precinct level.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Former President Donald Trump, who in 2020 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html">attempted to pressure</a> Georgia officials to flip the state in his favor after losing the state’s electoral college points to President Joe Biden, has celebrated the board’s changes. “They’re doing a great job,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republican-backed-georgia-rules-risk-undermining-election-certification-critics-say/">Trump said</a> in August. “Three members are all pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency, and victory.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Friday, the board voted on and passed <a href="https://www.wabe.org/georgias-republican-led-election-board-oks-controversial-rule-to-hand-count-ballots-2/">several more rule changes</a>. The <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/elections/georgia-state-election-board-meeting-live-stream-friday-september-20/85-75c5b5d4-c490-45a8-9ad9-6a7bb70e5a96">changes</a> require polling places to hand-count paper ballots, significantly slowing the reporting process; provide more access for poll watchers; post daily updates on the number of people in each county to cast a ballot; and post ballot reconciliation reports to a county website.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latest round of changes is already facing scrutiny; <a href="https://x.com/chriscarr_ga?lang=en">Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr</a>, a Republican, wrote a <a href="https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/georgia-state-election-board-rules-georgia-ag-chris-carr-opinion-letter/85-fec8c5a5-ae76-49d4-ab09-40a5e4f40b8c">letter to the State Election Board</a> ahead of their meeting warning them that the proposed rules “are not tethered to any statute — and are, therefore, likely the precise type of impermissible legislation that agencies cannot do.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To better understand whether moves from election boards like Georgia’s will impact the upcoming election, <em>Today, Explained </em>co-host Noel King spoke with <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/team/david-becker/">David J. Becker</a>. He’s the founder of the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research and has served as lead counsel on major voting rights litigation, including the Supreme Court case <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2002/02-182"><em>Georgia v. Ashcroft</em></a>, which dealt with redistricting in Georgia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A partial transcript of their conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows. Listen to the full conversation on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A">Spotify</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">David, we heard about these rule changes that the Georgia State Election Board has been trying to pass. They could, we understand, make disputing the election results easier. How much of a threat is that to the state’s election integrity?  </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David J. Becker</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgia’s Election Board has some oversight responsibility for directing counties and the county boards on running elections, but they have no authority on actually certifying the vote. And it’s important that we understand what certification of the vote is in every single state. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Certification is just the non-discretionary ministerial act of giving an election legal effect. That’s not to say that there aren’t opportunities to bring legitimate legal challenges if candidates or campaigns think that there has been a problem. But there’s another path for that. And that path is through the courts where they have to bring evidence and they have to subject that evidence to scrutiny and cross-examination. And a court has to hear it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not the place for political appointees like the Georgia State Election Board to decide they don’t like the election. So the reality is that the State Election Board’s efforts are not going to change the fact that whoever wins Georgia’s electoral votes will get those electoral votes. However, it could be used to fuel disinformation and lies spread by a losing candidate that an election was stolen.  </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What about after the votes are cast? What kind of protections are in place to make sure all of those votes are counted?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David J. Becker</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgia has all paper ballots. They have audits of those paper ballots to ensure that the machines counted them accurately. And Georgia has early certification dates. Counties are required to certify their votes — again, just reporting up to the state, “These are the votes. We legally say these are the votes.” And letting the state then certify. So if there are any counties or any county board members who decide that they have the power to overturn the will of the people of Georgia and want to delay that effort, the state will be able to act quickly on November 12 to compel them to certify. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There have been other attempts to do this in states like New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and Michigan. And they’ve been dealt with swiftly and decisively on a bipartisan basis. Georgia is prepared to do the same. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This will be resolved well in advance of the key deadline here, which in the presidential race is December 11. December 11 is the date that the new <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/21/23520649/electoral-count-reform-act-omnibus-trump">Electoral Count Reform Act</a>, passed by Congress in 2022, requires that electors be what’s called “ascertained,” which means that the governor has to sign a document saying the electors go to whoever won a given state. And I am 100 percent confident that Georgia, and in fact all of the states, will be able to work past efforts to destabilize an election and ensure that their voters in their states, including those who voted for the losing candidate, aren&#8217;t disenfranchised in the race for president and their electors are counted. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What should voters be watching out for on Election Day and the day after Election Day this year? Not just in Georgia, but around the country?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David J. Becker</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, it shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to us if any given candidate wins. Given how closely divided we are and especially how passions are running high, we&#8217;re going to see very high turnout. And that means we should expect on Election Day and night that election officials are going to be working incredibly hard to answer the one question on all of our minds, which is who won?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we also should recognize that they are counting very complex ballots in every jurisdiction in this country. There are dozens of races on those ballots, not just the presidential race, not just Senate races in some states, not just congressional races, but state races, local races. County races. Ballot measures. There are places where there are as many as six pages on the ballot with dozens of races. And so we should expect that we&#8217;re not going to know who won the election on election night because it takes some time, especially when margins are very narrow, to count all the ballots.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s one factor that election officials have no impact over — the margin of victory. And if the margin of victory is extremely narrow, it might take several days to get to the point where the media can call it. And that media call is unofficial. But it&#8217;s what we often think of as the decisive call. So we should be patient.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think we should also expect that there&#8217;s a very strong likelihood that a losing candidate might declare victory on election night and spread lies about the process. And we should ignore that. If you hear a candidate on election night claim victory before victory has been determined, you should know that that candidate thinks they lost because a candidate who thinks they won has every incentive to support the legitimacy of the process.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">David, although you sound very calm because there are protections in place to make sure the election is certified, the votes are counted, it sounds like you also do have some concerns that even though everything should go right, it could go wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">David J. Becker</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What I&#8217;m concerned about is that we may have to prepare for an all-out assault on reality, on the reality that a candidate might lose. I mean, we saw that happen in 2020. Donald Trump lost the election. It wasn&#8217;t particularly close. And nevertheless, there are tens of millions of people who have believed the lies and that delusion has persisted for four years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We should make no mistake that those who believe the lies, those who supported the former president are the target for this long-term grift. I have a deep amount of sympathy for people who voted for a candidate who lost and are sincerely disappointed. That&#8217;s who most of these people are.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, the former president and many surrounding him have targeted them for a long-term grift, raising money off of their disappointment and lying to them about the outcome of an election that he lost. So I think we have to prepare for the very likely possibility that if former President Trump loses — and by the way, he could win legitimately. And if he does, I will be the first one to say so, as I did in 2016. But if he loses, I think we should expect that we will hear a significant amount of disinformation and lies about that election intended to keep his supporters angry and perhaps violent, and definitely donating.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-is-striking-hezbollah-targets-lebanon-2024-09-23/">450 people were killed and 1,500 injured</a> in Israeli airstrikes targeting southern and eastern Lebanon, as well as the country’s capital, Beirut, on Monday. The airstrikes mark a significant and threatening escalation of hostilities following an <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">apparent Israeli attack</a> that used explosive pagers (and other electronic devices) to kill members of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group">Shia militant and political group Hezbollah</a>, which is based in Lebanon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel and Hezbollah have regularly traded rocket fire over Lebanon’s southern border with Israel for years. However, since Israel launched its war in Gaza in retaliation for Hamas’s attacks in Israel on October 7, Hezbollah — a Hamas ally — has increased the tempo of rocket launches, and has hit targets deeper within Israel. Israel <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/menasource/gaza-hezbollah-israel-war-ghaziyeh-escalation/">has increased its attacks as well</a>, and as a result, more than <a href="https://dtm.iom.int/reports/lebanon-mobility-snapshot-round-47-19-09-2024">110,000 Lebanese</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-evacuees-gaza-war-1841834d89af938a8445821567640aea">about 60,000 Israelis</a> are internally displaced.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week, Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant announced that Israel was entering a “new phase” of its ongoing war on Gaza and Hamas, one that would put greater focus on its conflict with Hezbollah. “The center of gravity is moving north. We are diverting forces, resources, and energy toward the north,” Gallant told members of Israel’s air force on September 18, referring to Israel’s northern border with Lebanon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Concerns that the conflict in Gaza would <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/364148/haniyeh-iran-israel-hamas-hezbollah">spark a full war</a> between Israel, Hezbollah, and their allies have existed for the <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group">entirety of the nearly year-long conflict</a>. But the latest rounds of Israeli attacks are a provocative escalation that could threaten the fragile balance of more measured tit-for-tat missile strikes that had become fairly routine for Israel and Hezbollah.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the unknowns are many: whether Hezbollah can or will respond in an escalatory fashion; whether Israel is prepared to launch a ground invasion into Lebanon, as it has done before to disastrous effect; and whether the US will —&nbsp;or can —&nbsp;constrain Israel and force them to pull back.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Israel and Hezbollah’s conflict, briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has been in conflict with Israel <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/18/hezbollah-and-israel-a-timeline-of-conflict">for decades</a>. The group is both a militia and a political party that holds seats in Lebanon’s parliament and provides services for the country’s impoverished Shia community. Formed in the wake of Israel’s disastrous 1982 invasion of Lebanon, Hezbollah has fought against Israel multiple times, most recently in 2000 and 2006. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latter war was particularly devastating, <a href="https://casebook.icrc.org/case-study/israellebanonhezbollah-conflict-2006#:~:text=Over%20789%20cluster%2Dbomb%20sites,casualties%20and%20deaths%20were%20children.">killing more than 1,000 people</a>, and leading to an estimated <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lebanon-war-cost/factbox-costs-of-war-and-recovery-in-lebanon-and-israel-idUSL0822571220070709/">$2.8 billion in damage</a> across Lebanon. The country has never quite recovered from that war; a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/5/15/23073845/lebanon-elections-political-corruption-economic-crisis-voter-apathy-beirut-port-hezbollah">government collapse</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9947038/">Covid-19</a>, and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/9/21/21445831/beirut-explosion-lebanon">Beirut port explosion of 2020</a> have pushed the country even further into crisis. The country can ill afford a full-scale war, and those in Lebanon not aligned with Hezbollah would <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group">like to avoid a conflict like the one in 2006</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether that is possible remains to be seen. Israel has staged a number of attacks on Hezbollah, including the reported assassination of senior Hezbollah leader Fuad Shukr <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/how-israel-killed-a-ghost-73e6db68?mod=hp_lead_pos7">in July</a>. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">coordinated attack</a> that used pagers and walkie-talkies to decimate Hezbollah’s communications system believed to have been conducted by Israel injured more than 3,000 and killed at least 32, including children and the elderly, according to Lebanon’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0jr5y23">health minister Dr. Firass Abiad.</a> (Israel does not claim responsibility for assassinations or attacks like last week’s; Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the attack.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel began bombing targets in southern Lebanon Friday, including the suburbs and interior of Beirut, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/09/20/world/gaza-israel-hamas-hezbollah">Hezbollah commander</a> who had been part of the organization since the beginning was killed as he met with other Hezbollah fighters. Monday, September 23, has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-lebanon-hezbollah-e3ca9c83642056f962fdf76319e3b8de">r</a>eportedly been <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-news-lebanon-hezbollah-e3ca9c83642056f962fdf76319e3b8de">the deadliest Israeli attack on Lebanon</a> since the 2006 war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s the distinct possibility that these continued attacks will spiral out of control; Israel has already shown willingness to cross the Biden administration’s “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/may/07/biden-israel-palestine-policy">red line</a>” in their war in Gaza by <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/5/6/24150729/israel-rafah-hamas-ceasefire-gaza-cairo-khan-younis-idf-gallant-netanyahu">invading the city of Rafah in Gaza</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah, meanwhile, must walk a fine line if it chooses to retaliate — which is not a given, despite leader <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/world/middleeast/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-strikes.html">Hassan Nasrallah’s promise</a> that Israel would “face just retribution and a bitter reckoning.” Hezbollah has reportedly fired 8,000 rockets into Israeli territory <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/israel-lebanon-attacks-09-22-24#h_8d4276e578d16d8eb0f76fc030e52138">since October 7</a>, some <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-news-09-22-2024-fb1aa8ae061885ba86855f7fe9ec5be7">targeting</a> the Israeli weapons manufacturer Rafael and the Ramat David air base, both near the city of Haifa. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has emphasized its solidarity with Hamas since the start of the war in Gaza, and has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-is-striking-hezbollah-targets-lebanon-2024-09-23/">promised to continue</a> attacks on Israel until there is a ceasefire. Both Hezbollah and Hamas benefit from Iranian financial and tactical assistance, but Hezbollah is much more closely aligned with Iran’s foreign policy objectives than Hamas is. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That has led to concerns about Iran becoming <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/4/2/24119425/israel-attack-syria-damascus-strike-iran-officials-reza-zahedi-gaza-war-united-states">involved in a regional war</a> should Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah escalate. Even if Iran doesn’t enter the conflict, a Hezbollah-Israel war could be incredibly bloody: Hezbollah is larger and better armed than Hamas; if Israel does launch a ground invasion into southern Lebanon, there’s a large chance that they will face even fiercer resistance than in Gaza. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, there are reasons to believe Hezbollah may choose to de-escalate the conflict, including the fact that any war would almost certainly be horrifically destructive to Lebanon, a country already struggling with a dysfunctional government and an economic crash.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Hezbollah has several concerns,” when it comes to deciding its next steps, Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Vox. “One is maintaining Iranian support, and [staying] aligned with Iran&#8217;s assessments and regional strategy. And the other is, 85 percent of Lebanese are now below the poverty line. The country&#8217;s been reeling economically, and if Hezbollah seems to invite a devastating Israeli assault on Lebanon, then some number of Lebanese would consider that reckless and damaging.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A diplomatic solution, perhaps one in which Hezbollah agrees to remove its positions close to Lebanon’s southern border, is certainly possible. That would allow Israelis to move back to their homes in the north. Whatever the outcome, however, Israel will likely not be able to eliminate Hezbollah, just as it has failed at eliminating Hamas. And continued aggression could lead to more extreme outcomes in the future. </p>

<p>Donald Trump wanted Nebraska Republicans to change the state’s electoral vote rules — in a way that would likely flip one electoral vote from Kamala Harris to him.</p>

<p>But he may not have the votes to get it done — a key state senator <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/09/23/state-sen-mike-mcdonnell-deflates-gop-hopes-for-nebraska-winner-take-all-in-2024/">confirmed Monday</a> that he was still opposed to the rules change.</p>

<p>Nebraska currently has an unusual way of distributing its five electoral votes. Rather than giving them all to the statewide winner — as 48 other states do — it awards two votes to the statewide winner, and the rest go to the winner in each of Nebraska’s three congressional districts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nebraska is a deep red state that Trump won by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-nebraska.html">a 19-point margin</a> in 2020. However, Joe Biden walked away with one of its electoral votes, because he won in Nebraska’s Second District, which includes the city of Omaha. <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4571799-trump-nebraska-governor-winner-take-all-electoral-system/">Trump</a> wants to switch this to a winner-take-all system, to lock down that vote.</p>

<p>The stakes are enormous: the single electoral vote from Nebraska’s Second District really could determine whether Trump or Harris wins in 2024.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Harris wins Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, while Trump wins Nevada, Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina, and no other outcomes change from 2020, then Harris would need Nebraska’s Second District vote to win. If she doesn’t get it, the electoral vote would be a 269-269 tie. The new House of Representatives would break the tie with each state delegation getting one vote, and since Republicans will almost surely control more state delegations, that means a tie likely goes to Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An earlier Trump push to change Nebraska’s rules <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/03/nebraska-electoral-votes-trump-push/">failed to get the votes</a> back in April. And if it had succeeded, Democrats had an obvious option for a response: changing the rules in Maine. Maine is the only other state that splits its vote by congressional district, but there, the current rule benefits Trump — it delivered him one elector in a state Biden won. Democrats could, in theory, have changed Maine’s rules and cancel out any advantage gained by Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump’s allies suddenly revived the Nebraska rules change effort last week, and that timing may not have been a coincidence: It is now too late for Maine to change its rules, since bills take 90 days after they are passed to become law in the state. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats cried foul across the country, characterizing this as a dirty trick — an attempt to steal the 2024 election. But on Monday, state Sen. Mike McDonnell — who switched from the Democratic to the Republican party earlier this year — <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/09/23/state-sen-mike-mcdonnell-deflates-gop-hopes-for-nebraska-winner-take-all-in-2024/">said</a> he was still opposed to the change. And if he holds firm, Republicans won’t have the votes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why oddball Nebraska and Maine split their votes by congressional district</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond the angling for partisan advantage, it is true that Nebraska’s and Maine’s rules are kind of odd — quirky historical accidents that arguably should be brought in line with the way the other 48 states do it. The fair way to do it would be for both to change their rules in the same cycle, standardizing the winner-take-all rule without handing either candidate an advantage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The history of the Electoral College system <a href="https://www.vox.com/21539173/electoral-college-explained-2020-trump-biden">is a bizarre one</a>, but the modern norm of how it works is: each state holds a statewide vote, and the top candidate in that vote would get all of that state’s electors. That’s the winner-take-all system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the nation’s earliest decades, there was more variety. Some states didn’t give voters a direct say at all, letting state legislators simply pick electors. Others did hold a statewide vote, but counted the results in separate districts of the state, awarding electors that way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The district system could allow regional differences to be represented. But it watered down a state’s impact on the national outcome, as compared to the winner-take-all system where all a state’s votes went to one candidate. And as partisan competition intensified, states flocked to winner-take-all — the district system was gone <a href="https://www.thegreenpapers.com/Hx/ElectoralCollege.html">by the 1830s</a>, and stayed gone for more than a century.</p>

<p>Then, in the latter half of the 20th century, it came back. Two states decided to switch to a system where two electoral votes would go to the statewide winner, and one electoral vote to the winner in each congressional district.</p>

<p>The first was Maine, in 1969, which <a href="https://www.centralmaine.com/2016/10/09/paul-mills-the-history-of-maines-distinctive-electoral-college-voting-system/">adopted a proposal</a> from an idiosyncratic legislator, whose apparent motivation was to help voters with different views be reflected in the Electoral College results. (Maine had used the district system back in the 1820s.) The second was Nebraska, in 1991, where legislators <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-omaha-nebraska-52a600f3491ed479da827e466bd914c2">hoped to</a> get presidential candidates to pay more attention to the state rather than writing off all its electoral votes as safely Republican.</p>

<p>One might think that proposals like this would move the Electoral College closer to proportional representation — but often, these proposals are just partisan dirty tricks. Republicans in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pennsylvania-electoral-college-plan-could-backfire-on-g-o-p/">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2021/01/08/gop-eyes-bill-to-reallocate-wisconsins-electoral-votes-by-congressional-district/">Wisconsin</a> have batted around the idea, believing gerrymandered congressional maps would guarantee them more than half the electors in swing states that more often lean Democratic.</p>

<p>But Maine and Nebraska do not seem to have had partisan motivations — and at first, there was no partisan impact, or indeed, any impact, because the statewide winner kept also winning every congressional district in both states.</p>

<p>As urban-rural partisan polarization intensified, that started to change. In 2008, Barack Obama won Nebraska’s Second District. Republicans responded by making the district more conservative in redistricting, but the underlying polarization trends continued and by 2020 Biden won it again. In Maine, the rural Second District swung to Trump in both 2016 and 2020. (Neither district was all that close in 2020 — Biden won NE-2 by 6.5 percentage points, and Trump won ME-2 by 7.5.)</p>

<p>So we’ve ended up with a system where 48 states use winner-take-all, and then two states throw a stray electoral vote to someone every so often, which is pretty odd — just one of many ways the US’s method of picking a president <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/7/12315574/electoral-college-explained-presidential-elections-2016">is ridiculous</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s going on in Nebraska now</h2>

<p>As partisanship and polarization have risen, Nebraska Republicans have attempted to respond. Back in 2016, they tried to switch to a winner-take-all electoral vote system. But there was a problem — the filibuster.</p>

<p>Yes, the Cornhusker State is the rare state to have a legislative filibuster with a strong supermajority requirement. In fact, it’s stronger than the US Senate’s — a two-thirds vote, or 33 of 49 legislators, is necessary to overcome a filibuster in Nebraska. And though Republicans have regularly had big majorities, it’s proven maddeningly difficult for them to get over that hump. They fell <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/us/nebraska-legislature-rejects-winner-take-all-electoral-vote-system.html">just one vote short</a> in 2016.</p>

<p>This year’s initial push kicked off in April, when conservative activist Charlie Kirk <a href="https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1775201223404331439">wrote on X</a> about a nightmare scenario for Trump supporters where Nebraska’s Second District could throw this year’s election to then-candidate<strong> </strong>Biden. He urged Nebraskans to “call their legislators and their governor to demand their state stop pointlessly giving strength to their political enemies.”</p>

<p>Just hours later, Gov. Jim Pillen made his announcement that, “in response to a call out for his support,” he supported such a change, and <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112204756443508099">Trump praised him</a> in a Truth Social post. But many <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/02/2024/trump-and-nebraska-governor-push-to-deny-biden-a-crucial-electoral-vote">doubted</a> that they had the votes. Republicans had 32 seats — one vote short of the 33 seats necessary to beat a filibuster.</p>

<p>The plot thickened when a Democratic state senator, McDonnell, <a href="https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1775572059479040275">announced</a> he was switching parties to the GOP — seemingly providing the necessary vote. Then the plot, er, thinned when <a href="https://twitter.com/ec_schneider/status/1775558726738477276">McDonnell told Politico’s Elena Schneider</a> that he would still support filibustering the electoral vote change. And when the proposal came to a vote, it wasn’t even close. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But last week, Republicans tried again. Gov. Pillen called in state senators and urged them to make the change, and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) traveled to the state with the same ask. Initially, some reports <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/09/18/winner-take-all-push-gets-help-of-gov-jim-pillen-sen-lindsey-graham-trump/">indicated</a> McDonnell was wavering.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, though, McDonnell <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/09/23/state-sen-mike-mcdonnell-deflates-gop-hopes-for-nebraska-winner-take-all-in-2024/">issued a statement</a> saying he was still against it: “After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change,” he said.</p>

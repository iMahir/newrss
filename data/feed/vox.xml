<p class="has-text-align-none">At first, I thought I was allergic to my shampoo. I’d switched to a new brand recently, and while my hair looked amazing, I’d developed an itchy ring around the perimeter of my skull, like someone had put a poison crown on me. When the itch became so distracting I couldn’t work, I reluctantly switched back to my old, frizz-promoting hair care regimen.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then my older kid started scratching.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It turned out that about half his class had head lice. At our house, closer inspection revealed scuttling insects on both our scalps. We began an odyssey of combing and shampooing that lasted weeks, caused at least one meltdown per person, and left our bathroom full of sinister metal nit combs and half-empty bottles of goo.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our experience is a rite of passage for young children and their families. In addition to being disturbing on a psychological level (I, for one, do not like the phrase <a href="https://extension.entm.purdue.edu/publichealth/insects/louse.html">“blood meal”</a>), lice can cause intense itching; Logan, 5, another recent sufferer, described his recent case to me as “super, amazing, big, wild itchy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lice are often a source of shame and anxiety for families. The insects have “been historically associated with things like poor personal hygiene or houselessness or a certain socioeconomic status,” said Dawn Nolt, a pediatric infectious disease doctor and the lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics’s <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/4/e2022059282/189566/Head-Lice?searchresult=1">2022 recommendations on lice</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fact, however, there’s some evidence that they prefer clean hair, Kate King, a school nurse in Ohio and the president of the National Association of School Nurses (NASN), told me. And the insects infest people of all walks of life, all around the world, though kids and caregivers are the most susceptible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lice are an annoyance, not a danger, Nolt said — they do not spread disease. But some school districts, including New York City, where I live, bar kids from the classroom if they’re found to have lice. For my kid, that meant a day spent getting combed in front of the TV, instead of attending kindergarten.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say no-lice policies — and in-school lice checks in which a nurse or other adult combs an entire class for bugs — don’t actually stop the spread of lice, and are especially problematic as school districts battle <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/1/9/23904542/chronic-absenteeism-school-attendance">chronic absenteeism</a> in the wake of Covid-19. “Since the pandemic, we really appreciate the benefits of in-person schooling,” Nolt told me. “Head lice is not a reason for a child to miss school.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The CDC has actually recommended against sending kids home for lice for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/28/nx-s1-5090917/head-lice-schools-cdc-guidance#:~:text=If%20you%20remember%20being%20sent,as%20the%20treatment%20has%20begun.">more than 10 years</a>. But a <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/lice/myths-about-head-lice-a7156006867/">website redesign</a> led to a <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/life-culture/2024/08/24/lice-schools-nuts-pinellas-hillsborough-county-cdc/">resurgence</a> of <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/will-kids-with-head-lice-in-illinois-schools-be-sent-home-early-latest-cdc-state-guidance/ar-AA1pDN6Z?apiversion=v2&amp;noservercache=1&amp;domshim=1&amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;wcseo=1&amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;noservertelemetry=1">interest</a> in the policy at the beginning of the 2024–25 school year, alongside what some say is an <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/head-lice-seem-back-in-force-in-nyc-schools-heres-how-to-prevent-and-treat-them">uptick in lice cases</a> after a pandemic lull. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of panicking, experts say, families and schools alike should approach lice as what they are: annoying bugs that want to eat us, but that can be defeated with the right tools, and the right attitude.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Logan told me, “Don’t give up.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The truth about head lice</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Head lice are about the size of a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lice/about/head-lice.html">sesame seed</a> and can live on a person’s head for about a month, feeding on blood. During that time, they lay eggs called nits, which they stick to the hair shaft very close to the scalp with an adhesive material. Those eggs incubate for about 10 days, Nolt said, before hatching and maturing into new lice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The itching that is the hallmark of a lice infestation is actually caused by the insect’s saliva, which can cause a mild allergic reaction in humans. This reaction takes four to six weeks to develop, Nolt said, so once you start scratching, you’ve already had lice for a while.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lice don’t have wings, and they <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/diseases/headlice/headlice.html">can’t jump</a>, but they spread by crawling from one person’s head to another, usually through head-to-head contact (something that happens a lot among little kids, who like to hug and roughhouse and generally get up in one another’s faces). They can spread through shared hats or clothing, but that’s much less common, Nolt said, because lice simply can’t survive for very long away from their source of warmth and food.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some kids, the worst part of having lice is getting rid of them. Typically, an adult washes a child’s hair, then uses a special lice comb (included with many over-the-counter lice shampoos) to find all the nits and remove them. Depending on the length of a kid’s hair, the process can take hours.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The combing really hurt,” Thomas, 7, told me. His parents let him play video games as a distraction, but “it still really hurt,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some kids don’t mind the combing — Byron, Logan’s 2-and-a-half-year-old brother, called it “tingly.” Adding some mythos may help: Logan and Byron informed me that their family had used “nit destroyer warrior” combs “made by lasers.” (A fact-check reveals that some nit combs are purportedly made using <a href="https://www.licedoctors.com/product/lice-comb">“laser technology.”</a>)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Complicating matters further is the fact that lice appear to have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4007213/">evolved some resistance</a> to pyrethrin and permethrin, the active ingredients in many over-the-counter lice shampoos. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4475297/">Some research</a> shows that dimethicone, a gooey polymer that basically suffocates lice, remains effective. This is what finally worked in my house, after several rounds of permethrin-based products failed. It is also extremely oily and takes forever to wash out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this is stressful enough without adding school disruption to the mix. Once children have symptoms, they’ve usually already had lice for weeks, Nolt said. Sending them home for a day or two does little to limit spread, but deprives the child of key learning time. Along with the CDC, the <a href="https://www.nasn.org/nasn-resources/professional-practice-documents/position-statements/ps-head-lice">NASN</a> and the <a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/150/4/e2022059282/189566/Head-Lice?autologincheck=redirected">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> also recommend against sending kids home for lice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In-school lice checks — a mainstay of my millennial childhood that’s still a reality in New York and elsewhere — are also ineffective, experts say. “It doesn&#8217;t produce any real results,” said King, the NASN president. “It’s also very demeaning and shaming for students.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a child has lice at her school, King contacts the family with information about treatment, and provides free lice shampoo upon request. “Our main focus is to be a helper, not a punisher.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, experts say schools and families should think of lice not as something shameful or frightening, but as a part of childhood — annoying, sure, but normal and not always avoidable. “Head lice are like the common cold,” said King. “Sometimes, it just happens.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What I’m reading</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/10/07/myopia-prevention-outdoor-time-children/">Nearsightedness is on the rise</a> among kids around the world, according to <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/27734/chapter/1">a new report</a> from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, possibly as a result of the rise in “near work,” such as reading and writing (the effect of smartphones and other screens is still unclear). The report’s authors recommend two hours of <a href="https://www.vox.com/family/370880/play-kids-outdoor-screen-time-phone-ipad-games">outdoor time</a> per day to counteract the trend, at least one of which should take place during school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Students with disabilities <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/report-almost-all-disabled-students-lack-access-to-college-readiness-programs/">lack access</a> to college readiness programs, <a href="https://www.centerforlearnerequity.org/wp-content/uploads/CLE-crdc2024_brief5_highSchool.pdf">another report</a> finds, even though they’re entitled to such support under federal law.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of Hurricane Helene, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/hurricane-helene-school-closures-education.html">tens of thousands of kids</a> are home from school, with no idea when they can return to the classroom. Even remote learning isn’t possible in some areas of North Carolina because of disruptions to internet and electric service. “This isn’t Covid remote learning. This is nothing,” a professor who has studied the impact of Hurricane Katrina <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/07/us/hurricane-helene-school-closures-education.html">told the New York Times</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At my house, we are reading Bill Bryson’s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/20548/a-really-short-history-of-nearly-everything-by-bill-bryson/"><em>A Really Short History of Nearly Everything</em></a>. Warning: This has required me to spend a lot of time trying to explain the Big Bang and the shape of the universe, topics that are pretty cognitively taxing at bedtime.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get in touch</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Halloween, I’m hoping to write about scary stories. As a fan of <em><a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/best-scary-stories-to-tell-in-the-dark-books.html">Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark</a></em> and <em><a href="https://goosebumps.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Goosebumps_books">Goosebumps</a></em>, I’m curious what kids are reading (or watching) to freak themselves out nowadays. For adults, I also want to hear about your favorite scary tales from childhood — or the ones that gave you nightmares for weeks. If you have observations about spooky kid content past or present, let me know at anna.north@vox.com. Your eerie recommendations (or warnings) could make it into a newsletter soon!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is the relationship between creativity and intelligence?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s a fundamental, perhaps unanswerable, question. Is it also an obsolete one? The question today seems to be: What is the relationship between creativity and artificial<em> </em>intelligence? We tend to think of artistic creativity as a uniquely human endeavor, but what if it can be much more?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Philosophers, artists, and scientists are already debating whether the art and writing generated by Midjourney and ChatGPT are evidence of machines being creative. But should the focus be on the output — the art that’s generated? Or the input — the inspiration?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And what about the other, smaller ways in which we use our creativity, like through a prank on a friend or in a note to a loved one? Does the value of those communications change if AI creates them?  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meghan O&#8217;Gieblyn is an essayist and the author of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/567075/god-human-animal-machine-by-meghan-ogieblyn/"><em>God, Human, Animal, Machine: Technology, Metaphor, and the Search for Meaning</em></a>. She’s been thinking about our relationship with technology for a long time. Her book, originally published in 2022, made a convincing case that we’re going to have to reimagine what it means to be human in the age of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I invited O’Gieblyn on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to explore how AI might force us to also reconsider the meaning — and importance — of creativity. As always, you can hear the full conversation on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How did you start studying and writing and thinking about the relationship between humans and computers?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I came to my interest in technology in a very idiosyncratic way. I grew up in a very religious family. There was a lot of fear about technology when I was growing up during the Y2K crisis, for example, and just all of this focus on the end times prophecies, which were often filtered through the lens of emerging technologies and fears about emerging technologies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I studied theology for two years at Moody Bible Institute, a very conservative, old Christian institution in Chicago, and ended up having a faith crisis while I was there. I left that belief system behind and just happened to read Ray Kurzweil and some other transhumanists in the years after that deconversion experience. I became kind of obsessed with the relationship between spiritual traditions and the larger philosophy of human nature that I had grown up with, this idea that humans are made in the image of God, that we&#8217;ve been given these divine capacities for reason and creativity.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since you brought it up, I should ask for a thumbnail definition of transhumanism.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Transhumanism is a movement that emerged primarily in Silicon Valley in the ’80s and ’90s. Followers believed that humans could use technology to evolve into a higher form of intelligence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, the conversations about those possibilities were very speculative. But I think the things that were being discussed at that time are very much being implemented now into technologies that we&#8217;re using every day.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You once asked a computer scientist what he thought creativity meant and he told you, “Well that&#8217;s easy, it&#8217;s just randomness.” What do you make of that view of creativity? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s no coincidence that a computer scientist came up with this definition. If you&#8217;re thinking about creativity, or what we call creativity, in large language models (LLMs), you can play around with the temperature gauges. You can basically turn up the temperature and turn up the amount of randomness in the output that you get. So if you ask ChatGPT to give you a list of animals at a low temperature, it&#8217;ll say something very basic like a dog, a cat, a horse. And if you turn up the temperature, it&#8217;ll give you more unusual responses, more statistically unlikely responses like an ant eater. Or if you turn it way up, it&#8217;ll make up an animal like a whistledy-woo or some Seussian creature that doesn&#8217;t exist. So there is some element of randomness.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m inclined to think that creativity is not just randomness because we also appreciate order and meaning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The things that I appreciate in art have a lot to do with vision, with point of view, with the sense that you&#8217;re seeing something that&#8217;s been filtered through an autobiography, through a life story. And I think it&#8217;s really difficult to talk about how that&#8217;s happening in AI models.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We have these large language models, things like ChatGPT and Midjourney, and they produce language, but they do it without anything that I&#8217;d call consciousness. Consciousness is something that&#8217;s notoriously hard to define, but let&#8217;s just call it the sensation of being an agent in the world. LLMs don&#8217;t have that, but is there any way you could call what they&#8217;re doing creative?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The difficult thing is that creativity is a concept that is, like all human concepts, intrinsically anthropocentric. We created the term “creativity” to describe what we do as humans. We have this bad habit of changing the definition of words to suit our opinion of ourselves, especially when machines turn out to be able to do tasks that we previously thought were limited to us.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inspiration has this almost metaphysical or divine undertone to it. And now that we see a lot of that work done by automated processes, it becomes more difficult to say what creativity really is. I think there&#8217;s already an effort, and I sense it myself too, to cordon off this more special island of human exceptionalism and say, “No, what I&#8217;m doing is actually different.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you think a machine or an AI could ever really communicate in any meaningful way?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s things that you can say in an essay or a book that you can&#8217;t say just in normal social conversations, just because of the form.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I love seeing the way that other people see the world. When people ask, “Do you think an AI could create the next best American novel, the great American novel?” We&#8217;re talking a lot in those hypotheticals about technical skill.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And to me, I think even if it was — on the sentence level or even on the level of concepts and ideas — something that we would consider, virtuoso, just the fact that it came from a machine changes the way that we experience it. When I&#8217;m reading something online and I start to suspect that it was generated by AI, it changes the way I&#8217;m reading. I think that there&#8217;s always that larger context of how we experience things, and intent and consciousness is a big part of it.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s something about the intentionality behind artistic creations that really matters to us. It&#8217;s not like when I consume a piece of art, I&#8217;m asking myself, how long did it take to make this? But I know subconsciously there was a lot of thought and energy put into it, that there was a creator with experiences and feelings that I can relate to who&#8217;s communicating something in a way they couldn&#8217;t if they weren&#8217;t a fellow human being. That matters, right?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that the effort that we have to put into making things is part of what gives it meaning, both for the audience and the person who&#8217;s producing it. The actual sacrifices and the difficulty of making something is what makes it feel really satisfying when you finally get it right. And it&#8217;s also true for the person experiencing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think about this a lot even with things that we might not consider works of genius. Everyday people have always been creative — like my grandfather, who would occasionally write poetry or make up funny poems for different occasions. He didn&#8217;t have a college education, but he was creative and the poems were personalized for the person or for the occasion. And that&#8217;s precisely the kind of thing that an LLM couldn’t do very well, right? It could write a simple poem and you could prompt it to do that. But what would that mean to us if it was just produced by a prompt? I think that really does change how you experience something like that.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you remember that controversy over the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgtHJKn0Mck">Google Gemini commercial</a>? It’s Google&#8217;s competitor with OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT. The commercial has a young girl who wants to write a fan letter to her hero, who&#8217;s an Olympic gold medalist or something like that. Her dad says something like “I&#8217;m okay with words, but this letter has to be perfect.” And so he&#8217;s just going to let the AI write it for them.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is horrifying to me because it shows that AI isn&#8217;t just coming for our art and entertainment, it&#8217;s not just going to be writing sitcoms or doing podcasts, it&#8217;s going to supplant sincere authentic human-to-human communication. It&#8217;s going to automate our emotional lives. And I don&#8217;t know what to call that potential world other than a machine world populated by machine-like people and maybe eventually just machine people. And that&#8217;s a world I desperately, desperately want to avoid.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a long time I wrote an advice column for Wired magazine where people could write in with questions about technology in their everyday life. And one of the questions I got very shortly after ChatGPT was released was from somebody who is going to be the best man in their friend&#8217;s wedding. And he said, “Can I use ChatGPT, ethically, to do a best man&#8217;s speech for me?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s cases of people doing this. People use it to write their wedding vows. And my first instinct was like, well, you&#8217;re robbing yourself of the ability to actually try to put into words what you are feeling for your friend and what that relationship means to you. And it&#8217;s not as though those feelings just exist in you already.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think anyone who&#8217;s written something very personal like this realizes that you actually start to feel the emotions as you&#8217;re putting it into language and trying to articulate it. I think about the same thing with this hypothetical fan letter that the girl is writing in the commercial, right? It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re stealing from your child the opportunity to actually try to access her emotions through language.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you think that AI will make radically new kinds of art possible?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Any of us who are daring to speak about this topic right now really are putting ourselves out there and risking looking stupid in two years or five years down the road. But it is true that AI is often called an alien form of intelligence and the fact is that it reasons very differently than we do. It doesn&#8217;t intuitively understand what&#8217;s relevant in a dataset the way that we do because we&#8217;ve evolved together to value the same things as humans.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a big question, but I&#8217;m comfortable asking you because of your theological background. Do you think we have any real sense of the spiritual impact of AI?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s a paradox in some way, right? Technologies are very anti-spiritual in the sense that they usually represent a very reductive and materialist understanding of human nature. But with every new technological development, there&#8217;s also been this tendency to spiritualize it or think of it in superstitious ways. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think about the emergence of photography during the Civil War and how people believed that you could see dead people in the background. Or the idea that radio could transmit voices from the spiritual world. It’s not as though technology is going to rob us of a spiritual life. I think that technological progress competes with the type of transcendence that spiritual and religious traditions talk about, in the sense that it is a way to push beyond our current existence and get in touch with something that&#8217;s bigger than the human. I think a very deep human instinct is to try to get in touch with something that&#8217;s bigger than us.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And I think that there&#8217;s a trace of that in the effort to build AGI. This idea that we&#8217;re going to create something that is going to be able to see the world from a higher perspective, right? And that&#8217;s going to be able to give our lives meaning in a new way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you look at most spiritual traditions and wisdom literature from around the world, it usually involves this paradox where if you want to transcend yourself, you also have to acknowledge your limitations. You have to acknowledge that the ego is an illusion, you have to admit that you&#8217;re a sinner, you have to humble yourself in order to access that higher reality. And I think technology is a sort of transcendence without the work and the suffering that that entails for us in a more spiritual sense.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What I&#8217;m always thinking about in these sorts of conversations is this long-term question of what we are as human beings, what we&#8217;re doing to ourselves, and what we&#8217;re evolving into. Nietzsche loved this distinction between being versus becoming. Humanity is not some fixed thing. We&#8217;re not a static being. Like everything in nature, we&#8217;re in this process of becoming. So what are we becoming?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Meghan O’Gieblyn</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At some point, I think, a threshold is crossed, right? Where is that? If we&#8217;re becoming something, we&#8217;ve already been becoming something different with the technologies that we&#8217;re using right now. And is there some hard line where we&#8217;ll become post-human or another species? I don&#8217;t know. My instinct is to think that there&#8217;s going to be more pushback against that future as we approach it than it might seem right now in the abstract.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that it&#8217;s difficult to articulate exactly what we value about the human experience until we are confronted with technologies that are threatening it in some way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the really great writing and the conversations that are happening right now are about trying to actually put into words what we value about being human. And I think these technologies might actually help clarify that conversation in a way that we haven&#8217;t been forced to articulate it before. They can help us think about what our values are and how can we create technology that is actually going to serve those values, as opposed to making us the subjects of what these machines happen to be good at doing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It seems as though the country has been engaged in one long screaming match since 2016. Go on YouTube or scroll through X and that feeling gets a face. Videos claiming that someone <a href="https://youtu.be/tUfQQwHo8R0?feature=shared">“silenced”</a> or <a href="https://youtu.be/x_WvnOV97js?feature=shared">“destroyed”</a> another party in a discussion about politics abound on social media. There are now nearly unavoidable clips of conservative personalities like <a href="https://youtu.be/SXdFOubvJKo?feature=shared">Charlie Kirk</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/CyirB7dqa1M?feature=shared">Ben Shapiro</a> arguing with college students at liberal universities or leftist commentators on their social platforms. Meanwhile, <a href="https://youtu.be/EEIvWNhuL8U?feature=shared">videos</a> of <a href="https://youtu.be/bVH_c-s9Oho?feature=shared">random</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/Qn_WAD-WZEY?feature=shared">folks</a> with polar-opposite political views sitting in a dark room arguing over hot-button issues — and often saying wildly offensive or misinformed things — are on the rise. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">She fought a good fight, but lost I fear . <a href="https://t.co/k7U3lOrvkl">pic.twitter.com/k7U3lOrvkl</a></p>&mdash; Stace (@StaceDiva) <a href="https://twitter.com/StaceDiva/status/1837572383491621001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the end of September, a YouTube video titled, <a href="https://youtu.be/68aej2qmCtw?feature=shared">“Can 1 Woke Teen Survive 25 Trump Supporters”</a> went viral, drawing attention for its absurd, Battle Royale-like premise. In two weeks, it had accumulated 9.6 million views. The video sees 19-year-old liberal TikTok pundit Dean Withers (a.k.a. the “woke teen”) thrown into a lion’s den of young, zealous Trumpers eager to prove him wrong. One by one, he argues with his opponents across a table about reproductive rights and Kamala Harris’s bona fides. One <a href="https://x.com/StaceDiva/status/1837572383491621001">clip</a> where he appears to stump a woman during a discussion about abortion and IUDs garnered millions of views on X. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is just one of the contentious and extremely clicky scenarios explored by the media company Jubilee in its popular YouTube series “Surrounded.” The series’ setup looks like a satire of what debate has become in the age of Trump: extremely competitive, theatrical, and unbalanced (literally and emotionally) to boot. What should theoretically be an exchange of facts and logic has become the ultimate bloodsport for a certain type of “thought leader” often happy to traffic in opinions and distorted truths. These oral pugilists are more interested in some online-only version of “winning” than having meaningful discourse. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the political spectrum, there has proven to be an appetite for watching people shout at each other. These on-air clashes have been the bread and butter of cable news networks like CNN and Fox News. Still, these filmed debates mostly promote the pessimistic notion that the US is too polarized to be saved. They’re frequently a front-row seat to all the misinformation, conspiracy theories, and regressive attitudes polluting the political landscape and affecting people’s daily lives. So why can’t we stop watching them?  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">In the Trump era, liberal vs. conservative face-offs are everywhere </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While this critique has certainly been amplified in the Trump era, the observation that public debate has become a circus is not exactly new. You can go back decades; in the 2000s, Jon Stewart (fairly) disparaged <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/10/8016365/jon-stewart-crossfire"><em>Crossfire</em></a>; in the ’90s, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> parodied the unproductive and shouty nature of political panel show <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOLF_D7JVZM"><em>The McLaughlin Group</em></a> and, later, <a href="https://youtu.be/Hp9kYKFRh2I?feature=shared"><em>The View</em></a>. However, in the digital age, this kind of content has been mass-produced and even more degraded. You no longer have to watch CNN or programs like <em>Real Time With Bill Maher</em> to see opposing parties talk over each other and manipulate facts. Instead, you can go to the New York Post’s website to watch two random people shout about the legitimacy of the Black Lives Matter movement in a series called <a href="https://nypost.com/video/why-this-black-woman-is-against-black-lives-matter/">“Face Your Hater</a>” or watch a group of strangers argue about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nE3EQEBzc0">traditional and modern masculinity</a> on Vice’s YouTube channel. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ryan Broderick, a freelance journalist who writes the newsletter <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/">Garbage Day,</a> began noticing these viral confrontations ramping up after the Obama era, a period that saw a growing cultural backlash to progressive policies and rhetoric (i.e. the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/7/12118872/southern-racism-tea-party-trump">Tea Party movement</a>) and eventually culminated in Trump’s election. This was a time when liberals and moderates were encouraging each other to “reach across the aisle” and talk about politics with their Trump-supporting relatives during holidays. He describes these filmed social experiments as an “impulse from extremely naive digital media companies.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That whole style of content got really popular because there was this impulse coming out of the Obama years that we could bypass all the unpleasantness of the last 10 years if we could just talk to each other,” said Broderick. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of these videos are at least designed as slightly more benevolent attempts to see if two supposedly opposing identities can find common ground or at least engage in a civil conversation. The YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhEt049ohYg&amp;list=PLxNRGjzMwCdzo0VFIT36FA5FHJrac2hhX">Only Human</a> has a series called “Eating With the Enemy” where two people from different backgrounds — like a drag queen and a Catholic priest, for example — share a meal while discussing political issues, like gay marriage. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others, like Vice’s popular “Debate” series on YouTube, can get a little more dramatic and heated, like watching a daytime panel show or a scene from <em>Real Housewives</em>. Even with a moderator guiding the discussion, they aren&#8217;t exactly designed with the goal of finding middle ground or even having one side convince the other of their argument. Rather, they feel like useless surveys meant to convey our country’s deeply divided climate. For instance, one debate between a group of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEIvWNhuL8U">“anti and pro feminists”</a> arguing over a slew of women’s and trans issues ends with some of the participants talking to the camera about their experiences. Ultimately, they leave more affirmed in their established beliefs than moved by other arguments. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Anti &amp; Pro Feminists Debate Abortion, Trans Rights, and #Metoo | VICE Debates" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EEIvWNhuL8U?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jubilee’s “Surrounded” series feels more like a MrBeast-inspired game show in its pure stuntiness. Even the way the channel highlights the number of people debating against one another resembles his excessive model. The prompts displayed in the top corner of the videos — like “trans women are women” or “Kamala Harris is a DEI candidate”— aren’t rigorous or challenging. They feel primed to become “rage bait” clips meant to get viewers excited or angry, to the tune of millions of clicks. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, this content is sort of genius in the way it attracts and satisfies a range of audiences because there’s typically someone you can agree with and believe made the better argument. For instance, someone can watch Jubilee’s <a href="https://youtu.be/WV29R1M25n8?feature=shared">video of Charlie Kirk</a> being schooled by college students with more educated arguments and still, if they’re a fan of his, believe he won the debate. Broderick says that Jubilee, despite the pugnacious nature of their videos, inadvertently creates this sort of “feel-good centrist” content designed for everyone. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I can&#8217;t fathom watching this and thinking that Charlie Kirk looks good,” says Broderick. “But from what I&#8217;ve seen of right-wingers watching this stuff, they’re like, ‘Oh yeah, he&#8217;s the one that&#8217;s making sense.’”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Online debates have become a successful way to self-brand  </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservative pundits, in particular, have taken online debate culture to competitive and self-serving extremes. The phrase “debate me, bro” has become  largely associated with the very online and combative community of right-wing commentators, like Dinesh D’Souza and Steven Crowder — a.k.a. the guy in the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/steven-crowders-change-my-mind-campus-sign">“change my mind” meme</a> — who are constantly challenging liberal politicians, women, or practically anyone who disagrees with them on the internet to verbally spar. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For personalities like Kirk, Ben Shapiro, and Jordan Peterson, these videos have become a promotional tool to prove their authority in the marketplace — or, more precisely, battlefield — of ideas. Given that many of them host debates or upload in-person confrontations on their media platforms, they’re able to edit or advertise themselves as outsmarting their opponents. For instance, the YouTube channel for Turning Point USA <a href="https://youtu.be/AeEFiJQCe_c?feature=shared">features</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/SkbzCZlFTVg?feature=shared">videos</a> of Kirk supposedly “destroying” “arrogant” and “naive” students on liberal college campuses on his speaking tours. These videos are not actually about producing an interesting dialogue but rather humiliating their opponents and highlighting their supposed stupidity. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leftists, like YouTuber Destiny and livestreamer Hasan Piker, have also gained visibility and clicks via their eagerness to argue with conservatives. Journalist Max Read, who writes the newsletter <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://maxread.substack.com/">Read Max</a>, says that, when it comes to these chronic debaters, the line between “self-promotion and movement-building” can be very thin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I can understand the idea that you&#8217;re not just boosting your own profile; you&#8217;re boosting the profile of your politics and trying to bring more people into it,” says Read. “However, I’m inclined to be more generous to YouTubers who make explanatory response videos than join debates.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dean Withers, who’s participated in several Jubilee videos, hosts livestreams on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsdeaann?lang=en">TikTok</a> where he debates with users about political subjects. He also posts solo responses to right-wing talking points. He says he understands people’s criticism around his debate content as clicky and unproductive. However, he says he uses these exchanges as opportunities to educate his audience. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The main prerogative of my platform is to inform the people watching the debates that I have on what the issues are, why they matter, and why you should agree with me,” he says. “I know that getting my opponent to agree with me is more than likely to never occur.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For someone, like Withers — who was in middle school when Trump was elected and whose political consciousness was developed in the social-media age — debating with strangers online may just seem like an obvious approach to activism. Research has found, though, that this phenomenon may create a more toxic picture of how humans engage in political discourse. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Political boxing matches might be entertaining, but they don’t reflect how we communicate in reality</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A March <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55131-4">study</a> found that political debates on social media often give the impression of a climate that’s more combative and divided than it actually is. Specifically, research found that Americans are more likely to argue over political topics with people they know and trust, like family and friends, than strangers on the internet, and often leave these interactions with positive feelings.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">University of California Berkeley professor Erica Bailey, who co-authored the study, says these intense, Jubilee-like debates “almost never happen in real life.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“While these debates can seem ubiquitous because we&#8217;re constantly being fed them through our screens, my research has found that the typical American debates hot-button issues infrequently,” she says. “Of the most common topics, like vaccines, reproductive rights, and policing, only about half of Americans have debated these topics in the last year.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the rare occasion that you may be forced to defend a political stance, it can still be a pretty daunting task and cause feelings of anxiety. This seems to be one of the reasons we can’t stop watching these videos. On the whole, these exchanges seem generally unpleasant, but it can provide a sense of relief to watch an expert — or someone who claims to be an expert — confidently expressing their opinions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When you engage in debate, you often find out all the ways in which your knowledge and understanding is incomplete,” says Bailey. “Watching debate videos is cathartic because we get to cosplay as an excellent debater who can articulate our position with ease. It also helps that these clips are certainly edited to show us the most persuasive moment of the exchange.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Humans also just tend to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345698319_Emotion_and_Virality_What_Makes_Online_Content_Go_Viral">engage more</a> with content that elicits a strong emotional response. It’s one of the reasons even the most obvious “rage bait” is hard to avoid on social media, whether you&#8217;re the type of person who would ordinarily click on it or not. This behavior, plus algorithms that boost this sort of controversial content, has created a cycle of doom content we can’t escape. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While content like Jubilee’s abounds, the staginess and over-produced structure of these videos underlie a comforting truth: This level of antagonism surrounding political discourse may be clicky but it is thankfully not natural. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"> “It might be surprising given the state of polarization,” says Bailey. “But humans are typically wired toward social cohesion. In the end, we really don’t want to fight; we want to belong. ” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around 15 years ago, a new campaign took off across the young social media ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People with learning disabilities and intellectual disorders were asking everyone else to stop using the r-word to describe them or even to make jokes. No more, “Bro, that movie’s so dumb, it’s [r-word],” no more, “Don’t be stupid, why are you acting like such a [r-word]?”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the internet, commentators had their doubts that the movement would succeed, or even that it was worthwhile.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Surely, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021103896_2.html?sid=ST2010021403772">detractors</a> <a href="https://wstyler.ucsd.edu/posts/r_word.html">argued</a>, we had seen this dance before, with words like “idiot” and “moron” and “stupid.”&nbsp;All of them were originally developed as clinical terms for people with intellectual disorders, and they all eventually became insults as the wider public picked up on them, in a process variously called <a href="https://becauselanguage.com/39-is-this-a-reference/">the euphemism cycle</a> or the <a href="https://stevenpinker.com/files/pinker/files/1994_04_03_newyorktimes.pdf">euphemism treadmill</a>. “Idiot” and its ilk emerged in an era that lacked <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24098830/holy-shit-brief-history-profanity-melissa-mohr-what-the-f-benjamin-bergen-praise-michael-adams">our current moment’s sensitivity over slurs</a>, so they hadn’t experienced the same boycott campaign that the r-word was facing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if the r-word was banished, wouldn’t new pejoratives simply replace it? “If interest groups want to pour resources into cleaning up unintentional insults, more power to them,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/11/AR2010021103896_2.html?sid=ST2010021403772">allowed a Washington Post column in 2010</a>. “But we must not let ‘retard’ go without a requiem. If the goal is to protect intellectually disabled individuals from put-downs and prejudice, it won&#8217;t succeed. New words of insult will replace old ones.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>All of them were originally developed as clinical terms for people with intellectual disorders, and they all eventually became insults</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet apparently against the odds, the campaign worked. Over the past decade, bit by bit, the r-word more or less vanished. (To a certain extent, though, the expected also occurred, as other euphemisms did in fact emerge. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/28/trump-harris-attacks-mentally-impaired-criticism/">Donald Trump has lately taken to contending</a>, just on the edge of a slur, that he thinks Kamala Harris might be “mentally disabled.”)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until the past year or so, that is, when the r-word appeared to be trending back up. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Posts <a href="https://mashable.com/article/r-word-social-media">using the word</a> have racked up tens of thousands of likes, bookmarks, and reposts on X in the last year. Edgelord comedians have started to use the word in their sets. “I know I said ‘retarded’ there a couple times. My bad on that,” said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce9_jwots-w">comic Shane Gillis in a recent set</a> as he introduced a joke about his uncle’s Down Syndrome. On FX’s new sitcom <em>The English Teacher</em>, teachers muse about how “the kids are not into being woke” anymore and “they’re saying the r-word again.” It’s become a bipartisan slur, available to anyone on the right or the left or in between <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/373990/heterodoxy-anti-woke-libertarian-tech-bro">who wants to show off their iconoclasm</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This summer I started hearing it right after the Democratic convention,” says Katy Neas, CEO at The Arc, a disability rights advocacy group. “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/tim-walz-gus-walz-neurodivergence/">Governor Walz’s son</a> [who has neurodivergence] appeared, and I saw people being comfortable in using it on social media.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Andrea Cahn, vice president at Special Olympics Unified Champion Schools who helped <a href="https://www.specialolympics.org/stories/news/spread-the-word-inclusion">lead the 2009 campaign against the r-word</a>, says she’s seen steadily increasing attention to the old parts of the Special Olympics website that used to promote their anti r-word campaigns. “Last year, people started asking for it because they were saying that they needed to reconnect with that messaging,” says Cahn. “So we promoted those pages, and traffic to the website went up by 200 or 300 percent or something like that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to say for sure that usage of the r-word is increasing. The use of <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24098830/holy-shit-brief-history-profanity-melissa-mohr-what-the-f-benjamin-bergen-praise-michael-adams">swear words across time is notoriously hard to track</a>. But it does at the very least look as though for some demographics, the r-word has become trendy in a way that it wasn’t a few short years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s how the r-word fell out of usage and why it seems to be coming back now.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Running on the euphemism treadmill</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the ways you can tell when a group is particularly marginalized is that the words we use to describe them come to seem humiliating and dehumanizing, even when they’re not intended to be. We can track this process very neatly when it comes to people with intellectual disabilities by observing the name changes of a group now known as the <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-1-4419-1698-3_1820#:~:text=The%20name%20was%20changed%20again,American%20Association%20on%20Intellectual%20and">American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities</a> (AAIDD).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the AAIDD was founded in 1876, its name was the Association of Medical Officers of American Institutions for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Persons. In 1910, it became the American Association for the Study of the Feebleminded. By 1933, it was the American Association on Mental Deficiency. In 1957, the American Association on Mental Retardation. Finally, in 2007, it became the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Idiot” and “feeble-minded” were legitimate medical diagnoses in their day. So, too, was “mentally retarded.” Over time, though, they all became words that laypeople were happy to throw around as insults, which in turn meant that as medical terminology, they came to feel humiliating to the people they were supposed to help. In order to do their work, the words had to shift. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This kind of shifting of meaning was called <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3087798">the euphemism cycle by linguist Sharon Henderson Taylor in 1974</a>, and later renamed the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/05/opinion/the-game-of-the-name.html">euphemism treadmill by psycholinguist Stephen Pinker in 1994</a>. “Euphemisms denoting low intelligence seem particularly susceptible to the sort of pejoration that the word ‘retarded’ is undergoing,” observed Taylor in her paper “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3087798">Terms for Low Intelligence</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The r-word started to fall out of official usage in the last decades of the 20th century and the first decades of the 21st. In 2010, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/07/11/2017-14343/rosas-law">Barack Obama signed into effect Rosa’s Law</a>, which removed the words “mental retardation” from federal law and replaced them with the words “intellectual disability” or “intellectual disabilities.” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150627145120/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704865104575588273153838564">Multiple states followed suit</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>By 2018, so many students had signed a pledge not to use the r-word as part of “Spread the Word” that the campaign was basically over</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the r-word faded out of official language, activists began to turn their attention to more casual use. Cahn says the 2007 film <em>Tropic Thunder</em>, which prominently features <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6WHBO_Qc-Q">a joke about actors “going full retard,”</a> was a major impetus for Special Olympics to launch their “Spread the Word to End the Word” campaign to eradicate the r-word once and for all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;“We had some youth advocates that were really vocal about the harm and the insult that it was — people with intellectual disabilities, athletes of Special Olympics, and a lot of our young people that were involved in Unified Sports in schools,” says Cahn. “We had a fairly concerted campaign around <em>Tropic Thunder</em>, and that really galvanized our population.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By 2018, so many students had signed a pledge not to use the r-word as part of “Spread the Word” that the campaign was basically over. “Our school participants were asking, ‘What’s next?’” says Cahn. The Special Olympics team decided to expand to “focus on a larger, broader inclusion message” focused less on teaching kids about the r-word specifically. After all, they already knew.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or, at least, they used to. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the r-word came back</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to say why the r-word is suddenly so much more visible now than it was a few years ago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One reason might be that influencers have far more reach now, and they experience less incentive to avoid insulting parts of their audience than traditional celebrities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;“Perhaps it has to do with the fact that the more traditional celebrity is more aware of the feedback or more concerned about a feedback loop that could happen,” Cahn says. “Whereas, for the more individual influencer, they have less at stake when being outrageous.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, for some online personalities, being outrageous is the whole point. Linguist Caitlin Green points out that the r-word has become a convenient marker of edgy identity among conservatives online.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What you&#8217;re doing when you use a slur is you&#8217;re telling the people in your audience, ‘This is the kind of person I am, and this is the kind of attitude I have toward the normies that don&#8217;t use that word,’” says Green. “You get the right-wingers using it because they&#8217;re anti-woke and not using the slur is <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Locals">local</a>, right?”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Linguist Christopher Hom notes that the heroes of the online right are those with the loudest voices when it comes to mocking those with disabilities, if not outright using the r-word. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/3/1/14772908/trump-disability-fda-megan-crowley">Trump infamously mocked journalists with disabilities</a> <em>twice</em> in 2015 during his successful campaign for the presidency. “That really sends a signal about what&#8217;s acceptable and about how our social norms can change,” says Hom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Elon Musk, who has <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/elon-musk-under-fire-for-using-anti-disability-slur-on-x">publicly used the r-word</a> to taunt his critics online, has chosen to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/12/1142399312/twitter-trust-and-safety-council-elon-musk">remove the old Twitter safeguards against hate speech</a> since he purchased the site in 2022. Under Musk’s reign, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/25/1239549276/elon-musk-lawsuit-hate-speech-researchers">the r-word has been free to spread and flourish</a> on what is now known as X.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It creates this cycle where you see that the word is allowed, so then others feel like they can use it,” says Hom.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The r-word seems to be particularly appealing for <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/03/elon-musk-racist-tweets-science-video/">Musk and others in the Silicon Valley right </a>who are preoccupied with racist pseudoscience around <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/08/race-science-far-right-charlie-kirk/679527/">whether some races have higher IQs than others.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That ideology is pretty closely connected with the tendency to go for a mental disability over another kind of slur,” says Green. If a central part of your worldview is the reprehensible idea that some races are physically and mentally superior, ableism becomes especially important: You prove that one race is better than another by making the claim that it’s less likely to experience disabilities and that people who experience disabilities are less than human.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“It creates this cycle where you see that the word is allowed, so then others feel like they can use it”</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The r-word can also be attractive to people who identify as leftists and want to make a point that they’re cooler than mainstream liberals. “A lot of them are trying to claim this position that&#8217;s actually kind of a balancing act to maintain,” says Green, “which is ‘Yes, I&#8217;m on the left, but I&#8217;m not one of those crazy, screechy lefty people. I&#8217;m cool. I&#8217;m willing to use slurs.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The resurgence of the r-word could also be seen as a sign that mainstream culture has gotten less censorious in the post-pandemic 2020s than it was during the more progressive 2010s. “People are just being less sensitive,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/18mz8jk/whats_with_the_resurgence_of_the_rslur/">said one poster on Reddit</a> during a conversation earlier this year about why the r-word has returned. “For most of the 2010&#8217;s the attitude was not offending anybody and walking on eggshells. Now it seems to be shifting to ‘Just don&#8217;t be an asshole and if you are here&#8217;s the hardline’ and the word ‘Retard&#8217; isn&#8217;t on that line.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why people think ableism is just not that bad&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ableism is frequently the prejudice that doesn’t quite make it to the hardline. “Ableism is an easy one to ridicule as a concept,” says Green. “We have these discourses that come up every once in a while on social media, where someone will be like, ‘<a href="https://themighty.com/topic/disability/imani-barbarin-ableist-backlash-doorddash-delivery/">Telling me not to use DoorDash is ableist</a>,’ or like, ‘Telling me I have to smile when I’m at my customer service job is ableist.’ And then everybody piles on them, and they&#8217;re like, ‘Oh my god, these online woke people, they&#8217;re out of control.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Ableism is the vector” that leads to stern think pieces about how wokeness has gone too far, Green adds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People may overlook the discrimination disabled people face if they compare it to other prejudices that run rampant in the US. Hom cites the <a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/hate-crime">FBI’s hate crime report</a>, which shows 28 incidents of violence against those with mental disabilities over the past year, as opposed to over 1,000 incidents against Black people and Jewish people combined. But violent crime against people with disabilities is still disproportionately high, <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/capd0919st.pdf">and in 2021, the Department of Justice reported that it was rising</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“But if you look at the other factors,” Hom continues, “the kind of boring factors that are really significant about quality of life, the ability to have a dignified life, to be able to have self-determination, it&#8217;s really bad actually. The numbers are quite shocking.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.prb.org/articles/u-s-adults-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities-are-living-longer-but-covid-threatens-to-erase-recent-gains/">People with intellectual disabilities live 12 years less</a> than other adults on average. For those with Down Syndrome, it’s 18 years less, and for those with cerebral palsy, it’s 23 years less. People with intellectual disabilities are more likely to develop <a href="https://publications.ici.umn.edu/impact/23-1/people-with-intellectual-and-developmental-disabilities-growing-old-an-overview">chronic health conditions</a> and to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/6/21200257/disabilities-coronavirus-group-homes-isolation-policy">die of Covid-19</a>. During the height of the pandemic, some states adopted the policy that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/6/21200257/disabilities-coronavirus-group-homes-isolation-policy">ventilators should be preferentially saved</a> for those without disabilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To state plainly a thing most people sort of already know: Our society <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/352245/caregiving-intellectual-disability-developmental-adult-autism-down-syndrome">is not set up well for people with disabilities.</a> It is very difficult and very expensive to live a good life as a disabled person in the US. Despite those facts, it seems to be very easy for many people to think of ableism as the kind of prejudice that doesn’t really count and the r-word as not a real slur.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jason Rogers, 32, has been involved in Special Olympics for years. As a teenager, he competed in swimming, which he says is his all-time favorite sport, and also practiced track and field.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It seems to be very easy to think of ableism as the kind of prejudice that doesn’t really count and the r-word as not a real slur</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Rogers is the coordinator of workplace readiness and inclusion on the leadership and organizational development team at Special Olympics International. He’s also community liaison for the Down Syndrome Community of Greater Chattanooga. Last summer, a stranger called him the r-word at a memorial service for a recently deceased family member.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Think before you say something,” says Rogers. “Don’t say something you regret. We take the r-word very seriously in the Down community.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite this seriousness, the r-word’s defenders protest that replacing it will be useless and that a new slur is certain to come along before too long. It’s a popular position to take. It’s popular even though the reason we keep having to replace medical terminology for people with intellectual disabilities is because we transfigure those words into a deeply humiliating insult, and we do that because our society is designed to treat people with disabilities with contempt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Ableism is what is fueling the euphemistic treadmill,” says Hom. “I take this as evidence that ableism really is pretty significant in our culture.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tomorrow is <a href="https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-mental-health-day">World Mental Health Day</a>, and in many ways, it seems like the world has made great strides in mental health care.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023 alone, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1331736/mental-illness-research-funding-united-states-by-nih/#:~:text=In%20fiscal%20year%202023%2C%20research,for%20FYs%202024%20and%202025.">poured $1.25 billion</a> into research studying how mental illness manifests in the brain. People are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/health/adolescents-drugs-polypharmacy.html">prescribed more psychiatric drugs</a> now than ever, while talking openly about depression, anxiety, and ADHD isn’t just becoming less stigmatized — online at least, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/we-need-to-stop-making-mental-illness-look-cool-on-social-media/">it’s almost cool</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite having more access to medication in the US than ever, over <a href="https://www.nbc.com/meet-the-press/video/more-than-50000-americans-died-by-suicide-in-2023-more-than-any-year-on-record/NBCN161285832#:~:text=Live-,More%20than%2050%2C000%20Americans%20died%20by%20suicide%20in%202023,than%20any%20year%20on%20record&amp;text=The%20U.S.%20surgeon%20general%20calls,and%20how%20to%20solve%20it.">50,000 Americans died by suicide last year</a> — the highest number ever recorded. The US Surgeon General describes mental health as “the defining public health crisis of our time,” but we’re barely any closer to understanding the neuroscience of mental health than we were 50 years ago.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Sign up <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">here</a> to explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the popular framing of mental illnesses as being fundamentally caused by <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/psychiatrys-new-brain-mind-and-legend-chemical-imbalance">electrochemical imbalances</a> in the brain, <a href="https://www.madinamerica.com/2012/01/psychiatrys-grand-confession/">a pile of evidence decades in the making suggests the truth is much more complicated</a>. It’s the biggest open secret in neuroscience — psychiatric medications often don’t work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If drugs that alter chemical signaling in the brain are capable of silencing auditory hallucinations and suicidal thoughts, then brain chemistry must somehow explain mental illness, at least in part. But while medications like antidepressants and antipsychotics make many people feel a lot better, they make just as many — or more — <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2018/2/25/16997572/causes-depression-pills-prozac-social-environmental-connections-hari">feel the same or even worse</a>. (Prescribing the right meds for the right condition is mostly a guess, and the wrong match can accidentally shoot someone into a manic episode, for example.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The brain is one of the most complex machines in the universe, made up of 86 billion cells connected by<a href="https://12ft.io/proxy"> 100 trillion synapses</a>. To give you a sense of just how complicated that is, it took over four years for neuroscientists to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03190-y">build a map of a single fruit fly’s brain</a>, which only contains about 0.00003% of the neurons in a human brain — and as much of a scientific achievement as that was, it doesn’t even come close to fully explaining a fly’s behavior. Try scaling that project up by several orders of magnitude, and the prospect of fully understanding human brain chemistry looks downright impossible. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It could be that neuroscience simply hasn’t had enough time to develop truly effective mental health therapies for most conditions. It’s a relatively young field, and scientists have only been able to get a good look at living brain activity for a few decades. The breakthrough psychiatry needs could be right around the corner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s also possible that some of the best mental health care lies outside Western psychiatry altogether.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe two things can be true at once.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Psychiatrists no longer think chemical imbalances cause mental illness. Why do we?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For thousands of years, mental illness could only be explained by <a href="https://bcmj.org/mds-be/historical-perspectives-theories-diagnosis-and-treatment-mental-illness">supernatural forces or moral deviance</a>. In Enlightenment-era Europe and its colonized territories, people with psychiatric disorders were largely <a href="https://ehne.fr/en/encyclopedia/themes/political-europe/control-and-discipline/psychiatric-institutions-in-europe-nineteenth-and-twentieth-century">confined to asylums</a> — later rebranded as “psychiatric hospitals” — up <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/asylums/special/excerpt.html">until the 1950s</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the early 20th century, Sigmund Freud and his peers popularized <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/psychoanalytic-therapy">psychotherapy</a>, which helped (<a href="https://www.apa.org/about/policy/resolution-psychotherapy">and continues to help</a>) people navigate disorders like depression and anxiety. But physicians at asylums were initially <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2012/03/asylums#:~:text=Psychotherapy%20emerges,lay%20behind%20mental%20health%20problems.">hesitant to adopt it</a>, preferring a “somatic” approach to mental health care that involved stimulating the body and the nervous system to alter the mind. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leading doctors once believed that disorders like schizophrenia were caused by an <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jonmd/citation/1942/01000/Pharmacologic_Aspects_of_Shock_Therapy.3.aspx">underactive “vegetative” nervous system</a>, an old term for the parts of the brain that control basic life-sustaining functions like digestion and breathing. Early psychiatric treatments were designed to send a big enough shock to the brain — whether with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165032700003670?via%3Dihub">electricity</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670443/">an intentional malaria infection</a>, or<a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/ajp.89.1.143"> coma-inducing drugs</a> — to kickstart these supposedly underactive processes. Psychiatrists who invented malaria treatment — using the malaria virus to induce a high fever, hopefully killing neurosyphilis-causing bacteria — and the prefrontal lobotomy <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3670443/">both won the Nobel Prize in Medicine</a> while asylums were still the norm in Europe.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over time, however, physicians began to acknowledge that their somatic treatments weren’t working very well. That, combined with the observation that mentally ill brains didn’t seem to have anything visibly wrong with them when autopsied, began to drive physical treatments out of fashion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everything changed in 1952, when Parisian surgeon Henri Laborit <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/dh52dr.html">accidentally discovered that chlorpromazine</a>, an antihistamine he used to make anesthesia less dangerous for his patients, was also a powerful antipsychotic. When chlorpromazine entered the market in 1954, it <a href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.pn.2021.1.7">changed psychiatry</a> like the <a href="https://diabetes.org/blog/history-wonderful-thing-we-call-insulin">discovery of insulin</a> changed diabetes. Suddenly, people who had been chronically restrained in mental hospitals could have calm conversations with their psychiatrists. Within a year, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/asylums/special/excerpt.html">public psychiatric hospitals in the US began closing</a> as policymakers hoped that new drugs would render institutionalization obsolete.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, no one knew how drugs like chlorpromazine worked, only that they did, albeit with unpleasant <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18811-chlorpromazine-tablets">side effects</a> like drowsiness, weight gain, and uncontrollable muscle spasms. Neuroscientists later figured out that antipsychotics like chlorpromazine bind to a certain type of dopamine receptor in the brain, flagging <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24159087/what-is-dopamine-hacking-fasting-does-it-work-science">the neurochemical dopamine</a> — specifically, having too much of it — as the biological root of schizophrenia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea that a chemical imbalance could change someone’s thoughts, feelings, and behaviors quickly spread throughout psychiatry. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825">Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</a> (SSRIs) like Prozac, widely used antidepressants <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19442174/#:~:text=The%20clinical%20introduction%20of%20fluoxetine,for%20new%20families%20of%20antidepressants.">introduced in the 1980s</a>, block neurons from reabsorbing leftover serotonin after a chemical signal is sent. Theoretically, if a lack of serotonin contributes to depression, keeping more serotonin molecules available should make people happier.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK361016/">half of people who take SSRIs</a> feel better after a couple of months. However, antidepressant researcher Alan Frazer <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2012/01/23/145525853/when-it-comes-to-depression-serotonin-isnt-the-whole-story/">told NPR</a>, “I don’t think there’s any convincing body of data that anybody has ever found that depression is associated to a significant extent with a loss of serotonin.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pinning schizophrenia simply on dopamine is similarly oversimplified and old-fashioned. Today, researchers believe that many neurotransmitters — on top of other genetic, social, and environmental factors — affect the likelihood that someone experiences mental illness.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even though dopamine- and serotonin-related self-help videos keep making the rounds on TikTok, neuroscientists and psychiatrists <a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/debunking-two-chemical-imbalance-myths-again">have been vocally skeptical</a> of the “chemical imbalance” trope for decades. Electrochemical interactions, to the extent that scientists are capable of understanding them, can’t fully explain — or more importantly, treat — mental illness. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The future of mental health doesn’t belong only to neuroscience</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thinking of mental illness as something that medication can solve provides people “a way to establish their suffering as both tangible and unfeigned, and it offers a simple account and positive prognosis for their struggles,” sociology professor <a href="https://iasculture.org/scholars/profiles/davis">Joseph Davis</a> wrote for <a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/lets-avoid-talk-of-chemical-imbalance-its-people-in-distress">Psyche</a>. If a person claims their mental illness as a disease beyond their control, like cancer, then <a href="https://medium.com/@stefkaufman/visions-for-a-liberated-anti-carceral-crisis-response-c81791459a99">others may be more likely to view them as humans</a> worthy of respect and opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two weeks ago, the US Food and Drug Administration <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/26/health/fda-schizophrenia-drug.html">approved a new antipsychotic drug</a> that doesn’t target dopamine receptors — the first since chlorpromazine was first introduced. The new medicine, called Cobenfy, targets acetylcholine instead, a neurotransmitter that notably isn’t dopamine, but can affects dopamine levels indirectly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that Cobenfy is the first new option presented in 70 years was enough to make headlines. But&nbsp;whether it actually works better than existing options remains to be seen: None of the drug’s three clinical trials ran long enough to tell whether Cobenfy will cause the same long-term side effects — dramatic weight gain, repetitive body movements — as its predecessors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The introduction of Cobenfy captures a lot of what’s troubling — and what’s hopeful — about the role of neuroscience in treating mental illness. Sure, a new pharmaceutical treatment may relieve the worst symptoms of schizophrenia with fewer side effects than before. But introducing a new drug can’t eliminate the condition altogether or fundamentally shift how people navigate psychosis.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latter strategy — radically reconsidering how communities care for people with even the most severe mental illnesses — is <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/schizophrenia">recommended by the World Health Organization</a>. In many cultures, mental health problems <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23402638/mental-health-psychiatrist-shortage-community-care-africa">are not considered biomedical problems</a>, so people generally don’t seek things like medication. Community-based mental health care, where lightly-trained laypeople facilitate therapy sessions in their own neighborhoods, can work as well as formal psychiatric care in many settings, with or without medication.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While community-based models are often discussed in the context of non-psychotic mental illnesses like depression, options beyond psychiatry can <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/magazine/antipsychotic-medications-mental-health.html">help people experiencing more severe psychosis</a>, too. Anti-carceral care strategist and crisis responder <a href="https://medium.com/@stefkaufman/visions-for-a-liberated-anti-carceral-crisis-response-c81791459a99">Stefanie Kaufman-Mthimkhulu believes</a> that whether the root cause of psychosis is ultimately ancestral spirits, childhood trauma, post-viral inflammation, or a delicate shift in neurochemistry, “it is critical to offer people multiple ways to define and make sense of our experiences.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neuroscience can only take us so far. At some point, our willingness to find value in mental states beyond our own has to take over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latest health check on wildlife is in, and it’s not pretty. A <a href="http://worldwildlife.org/livingplanetreport">new report</a> by two of the world’s leading environmental groups reveals that the average size of wildlife populations worldwide has shrunk dramatically, by what the report calls a “catastrophic” 73 percent in the last 50 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Living Planet Report, published by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), found that creatures living in rivers and lakes, such as the <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/amazon-river-dolphin">Amazon river dolphin</a>, have experienced the most severe declines. Populations of these freshwater species have declined by an average of 85 percent, according to the Living Planet Index (LPI), a tool for measuring wildlife populations on which the report is based. Across the animal kingdom, meanwhile, wildlife populations are vanishing fastest in Latin America and the Caribbean — part of the globe that’s home to a tremendous diversity of life. The research does not include invertebrates such as insects and snails.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Losing wild animals isn’t good for anyone. Bats eat insect pests and <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/370002/bats-link-babies-death-study-white-nose-syndrome">lower the use of pesticides</a>, yet many of them are imperiled. Parrotfish, which have declined in some regions, <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/375178/parrotfish-algae-coral-reef-climate-change">can improve the health of coral reefs</a> that <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/366763/bonaire-coral-reef-caribbean-climate-change">safeguard coastal communities</a>. All kinds of birds and mammals help pollinate plants and <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/22877262/seeds-plants-animals-climate-migration">spread seeds</a> throughout the forest, sustaining forests and the rainfall they generate; many of them are vanishing, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is not just about wildlife,” Daudi Sumba, WWF International’s chief conservation officer, said on a press call Monday unveiling the report. “It’s about the essential ecosystems that sustain human life.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/LPI-screenshot.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.7625964082644,100,82.474807183471" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="World Wildlife Fund and the Zoological Society of London." />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The new report is an alarming status check on the state of our planet, and the headline numbers it reveals will likely be cited in countless news and government reports. The Living Planet Index is one of the key metrics used to track global progress in efforts to conserve the environment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But … is it accurate?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Coming up with simple figures to describe the state of the world’s wildlife is inherently difficult, but more than half a dozen scientists told me that the methods used to calculate the index may cause it to overstate wildlife declines, and perhaps significantly so. Some even called it misleading. One researcher voiced concerns that if leading environmental groups exaggerate wildlife declines, it could ultimately erode trust among the public, making action on a very real crisis that much harder to achieve.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While there’s no question that biodiversity is in decline, growing criticism of WWF’s estimation casts doubt on the scale of loss —&nbsp;or at least on science’s ability to accurately measure it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Scientists have poked holes in WWF’s key figure</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before digging into the report, it’s important to reiterate: There is indeed a crisis of biodiversity loss. This is unequivocal. Coral reefs are <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24137250/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-change">overheating</a> and dying en masse. North America has lost some <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaw1313">3 billion birds</a>.<a href="https://www.vox.com/explain-it-to-me/371434/insect-apocalypse-bees-decline-loss"> Insects are indeed vanishing</a>. The rate of extinction is <a href="https://royalsociety.org/news-resources/projects/biodiversity/decline-and-extinction/#:~:text=Now%2C%20the%20extinction%20rate%20is,are%20being%20degraded%20or%20lost.">accelerating</a>. In Hawaii, which has been called the <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2023/12/14/23990382/extinction-capital-hawaii-endangered-species-act">extinction capital of the world</a>, entire species of birds — and all the cultural heritage they carry — are blinking out as I write this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new WWF report underscores this frightening trend. We are living in a time of profound biodiversity loss.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Calculating a single figure to encompass all of this loss isn’t easy. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and counting animals year after year is difficult and time-consuming. “Generating a single estimate for all species in all locations is extremely challenging,” said <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/laura-melissa-guzman/">Laura Melissa Guzman</a>, a quantitative biologist at the University of Southern California. “I don’t think we have reached consensus as a scientific community of what is the best way to do that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">WWF’s approach relies on something called the Living Planet Index, which is produced by ZSL. It measures the average change in animal populations worldwide since 1970. To come up with the global LPI, scientists first calculate how individual populations of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish have changed, as I <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2022/10/12/23399105/biodiversity-loss-wwf-living-planet-index">wrote in 2022</a>, when WWF published its previous installment. A population of, say, 1,000 manatees that has lost 500 has decreased by 50 percent. The same is true for a population of 10 that has lost just five. Then they average up all of those changes, be they increases or decreases, to produce one number. That means the index is an average of changes in population sizes, not the average of the number of creatures lost.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is confusing. In the past, many media stories <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2022/10/12/23399105/biodiversity-loss-wwf-living-planet-index">misinterpreted figures</a> from the index and reported that Earth lost more than two-thirds of its wildlife in the last 50 years. That’s wrong. The headline number —&nbsp;two-thirds, or in the case of the new report, 73 percent —&nbsp;refers to the average decline of thousands of different animal populations, not the total number of animals.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-453767238-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.834813777373,100,78.330372445255" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Populations of Chinstrap Penguins in Antarctica have declined, on average, by over 60 percent since 1980, according to the new report. | Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But a more fundamental issue than bad headlines is that the index — the basis of the new report — is not calculated correctly, according to a team of researchers at the Center for Theoretical Study in the Czech Republic, a joint institution of Charles University and the Czech Academy of Sciences.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, they published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49070-x">a paper</a> in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em> that pointed out what they considered mathematical flaws in the LPI. Those flaws, the authors claim, bias the index and cause it to exaggerate the decline of wildlife.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The study takes issue with a number of things, including the math used to calculate the index and how ZSL handles poor-quality population data. That lower quality data includes population trends —&nbsp;ups and downs in the number of animals —&nbsp;based on counts from only a few points in time. For a <a href="https://communities.springernature.com/posts/the-living-planet-index-is-not-a-reliable-measure-of-population-changes">variety of complicated reasons</a>, the authors say, ZSL’s choices in how to calculate the index bias the data toward declines. In reality, declines and increases are more balanced, they say.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One example relates to sampling errors, cases when scientists don’t accurately report the number of animals in a wildlife population, perhaps because they’re hard to spot. If the population is small to begin with, accidentally counting fewer animals has a more dramatic, negative effect on the population trend than accidentally counting more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m really convinced that the decline of vertebrate populations is not as serious as the LPI says,” David Storch, a study coauthor and researcher at the Center for Theoretical Study, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several scientists who were not involved in the <em>Nature Communications</em> study told Vox that the concerns the article raises are valid and that biases embedded in the calculation may indeed exaggerate wildlife declines. <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/rodolfo-dirzo">Rodolfo Dirzo</a>, a biodiversity researcher at Stanford University who reviewed the new report, said that while the scale of wildlife population declines is extreme, it’s likely smaller than what the WWF report suggests due to how the LPI was calculated. (Disclosure: Dirzo was one of my advisers in graduate school.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Given the broad adoption of the LPI in global biodiversity policy arena, the kind of comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the LPI that Tószögyová and colleagues performed is long overdue,” <a href="https://www.natureserve.org/whos-who/staff/292">Bruce Young</a>, chief scientist at NatureServe, a nonprofit wildlife data organization, said in an email. “I was always nervous about the certainty with which the LPI authors presented their results.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although an early version of the <em>Nature Communications</em> study was available in 2023, WWF did not tweak how the LPI is calculated in response to the paper. Storch believes there’s an incentive to keep the index as is. It’s not so much a scientific tool, he said, but a tool to raise awareness of the biodiversity crisis — and raise money.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I see these indices more as a communication tool,” said Rahel Sollmann, a quantitative ecologist at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife in Berlin, who was not involved in the new report or the <em>Nature Communications</em> study. “I wouldn’t put too much trust into its actual numerical value.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/freshwater-screenshot.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.880051767751,100,78.239896464498" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The Living Planet Index for freshwater animals including fish. | WWF/ZSL" data-portal-copyright="WWF/ZSL" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">I posed these criticisms to WWF and scientists at ZSL. <a href="https://www.zsl.org/about-zsl/our-people/dr-robin-freeman">Robin Freeman</a>, a scientist at ZSL who was involved in the LPI analysis, said he doesn’t agree that biases overestimate the measure of wildlife declines.&nbsp;Changing the way ZSL calculates the index to remove what some researchers see as statistical biases would have consequences of its own, he said. Freeman <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2887653/v1">argues</a> that removing less detailed or more error-prone data from the calculation — much of which is from poorer regions in the tropics where there’s less research — could fail to capture the full picture of wildlife declines.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Louse McRae, another ZSL scientist who also works on the index, added that it’s also possible that the LPI actually underestimates the scale of declines. That’s because the index tends to include more population data from birds and mammals, well-studied groups that are typically declining less than, say, reptiles and amphibians, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We do an awful lot of work to test the datasets, test the impact of outliers and extreme shifts in population,” <a href="https://www.zsl.org/about-zsl/our-people/andrew-terry">Andrew Terry</a>, ZSL’s director of conservation and policy, said in a Monday press briefing. Speaking about the index, he said ZSL remains “confident in its robustness.” (ZSL also published a <a href="https://www.livingplanetindex.org/documents/LPR2024_Technical_Supplement.pdf">technical document</a> alongside the new report that details its testing.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A spokesperson for WWF, Amy Fallah, said the main purpose of the Living Planet Report “is to raise awareness about the scale of environmental challenges facing our planet and drive urgent action that prioritizes nature in global decision-making.” That’s why the group published it ahead of COP16, a major UN biodiversity conference, where environmental leaders will meet to hash out plans for conserving nature.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The LPR’s central aim has always been to inform and influence policy decisions that put nature at the heart of solutions to the challenges our planet faces,” Fallah said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>We know wildlife is declining. Does it matter if it’s exaggerated?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes and no. If the leading research and advocacy groups, such as WWF, are seen to overstate the problem, the public could lose the sense of urgency and may be less likely to lend support for what is a very real problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s a real risk to overstating the magnitude of the biodiversity crisis,” Young of NatureServe told me. “The public could get the impression that the conservation community is prone to exaggeration and therefore calls for action to reduce wildlife loss could go unanswered.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Young also mentioned that the “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-01285-z">extinction denier</a>” community — comprising people who deny that we’re living through a sixth mass extinction fueled by humans — feeds off examples, real or not, that show that wildlife is doing better than we thought. That makes it ever more important for measures of biodiversity loss to capture examples of successful conservation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then again, we’re just talking about shades of decline — whether the biodiversity crisis is really, really bad, or really, really, <em>really </em>bad. Regardless of how precise the LPI is, it portrays a trend of profound nature loss that no serious scientist disputes. “The report has been useful in bringing attention to the fact that there is a significant decline in populations of many species of vertebrates,” Dirzo said.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-549037541.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.7813932477765,100,80.437213504447" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The number of hawskbill sea turtles in northeastern Australia has fallen precipitously in recent decades. | Reinhard Dirscherl/ullstein bild via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Reinhard Dirscherl/ullstein bild via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">If the figure ultimately serves as a communication tool, it’s an effective one, judging by how widely the LPI is reported and cited. “Our goal is to use it as a tool for raising awareness about the dual crises of nature loss and climate change and urging the public and private sector to take action,” Fallah said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And to be clear: Communication really matters. The decline of wildlife remains a somewhat fringe issue with <a href="https://royalsociety.org/-/media/policy/publications/2023/public-views-climate-change-biodiversity-loss.pdf">low public awareness</a>, even compared to other environmental concerns like climate change. This in itself is alarming, considering the sheer scale of the problem and how it impacts us all. We are talking about the ongoing collapse of ecosystems with immeasurable spiritual and cultural worth that provide human communities with clean water, healthy food, and other basic needs. They are irreplaceable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If WWF’s new report — and the LPI index — can help communicate the problem, that ultimately seems useful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It shows us that we’re still not doing enough,” said <a href="https://www.ecolabunam.com/gceballos">Gerardo Ceballos</a>, an ecologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). “The most important thing to understand is that unless we can save biodiversity there’s no way we can save humanity.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People have accused me and other people of being alarmists,” Ceballos told me. “We are alarmists because we are alarmed.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a culture, Americans are coming to better understand the injustice that was done to Lyle and Erik Menendez. The brothers were convicted in 1996 of murdering their wealthy parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, seven years earlier in a gruesome double homicide, when Lyle was 21 and Erik just 18. Their trials unfolded amid a tabloid media frenzy that emphasized the brothers’ presumed greed and sociopathy while mocking the decades of emotional and sexual abuse they claim to have experienced at the hands of their father. Despite overwhelming witness testimony presented in their first trials that they were telling the truth about their abuse, they were each ultimately sentenced to life without parole.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/374720/menendez-brothers-abuse-claims-real-monsters-netflix-drama">Netflix’s recent Ryan Murphy docudrama, <em>Monsters</em></a>, takes a frank look at the brothers’ allegations of abuse, but it doesn’t do them any favors either, buying into the possibility that the pair made the whole thing up for sympathy and even implying an unfounded incestuous relationship between them. So it makes sense that in order to balance out those rather jarring claims, Netflix also recently launched a documentary film, simply titled <em>The Menendez Brothers</em>, that backs the abuse claims with an impressive number of first- and secondhand sources — including the brothers themselves, who appear via recorded phone calls from prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several members of the Menendez family appear on the documentary with stories of the abuse the brothers suffered from their father, including Joan Vander Molen, Kitty Menendez’s sister, and Diane Vander Molen, a cousin of Lyle and Erik.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Diane spent most of her summers growing up with the Menendez family and has never deviated from <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/lyle-erik-menendezs-cousin-testified-sexual-abuse-speaks/story?id=44420173">the story she testified to</a> at the brothers’ first trials — that Lyle had told her about their father’s sexual abuse when he was just 8 years old. Her testimony also implicated Kitty Menendez, who, she alleged, knew about Lyle’s claims and either disbelieved them or chose to ignore them. After that, the brothers have said the alleged abuse went on for years after that, with the brothers claiming that their father’s sexual abuse of Erik continued into Erik’s adulthood, with Lyle learning that his brother was still being abused just days before the murders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Multiple Menendez family members recalled several chilling stories of abuse, but one about a trust fall gone wrong in Lyle’s childhood, the first story Diane Vander Molen relates in the documentary, seems particularly revealing as a glimpse into the lives the brothers lived.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“One time Jose put Lyle on a kitchen counter and prompted Lyle to jump off, and he was going to catch him. As Lyle did so, Jose backed off and let him fall to the ground, telling him that you can never trust anybody.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taken as an isolated example, we might consider this an anecdote of a cruel prank played on an innocent child. But in the context of everything we know about Jose Menendez and his children, it becomes much more significant. It’s a simple but revealing look at a man whose behavior seemed to be a textbook example of <a href="https://endcoercivecontrolusa.com/blog/what_is_coercive_control">coercive control</a> — a long-term behavior pattern in which a family member carries out an ongoing strategy of manipulation and emotional abuse against his partner and/or his children. This was just one example of a lifetime of alleged psychological torture. It’s anguishing to think what such an environment would do to two young boys forced to play these kinds of mind games by a parent whom they loved and trusted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Coercive control <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22758030/gabby-petito-domestic-intimate-partner-violence-prevention">often accompanies</a> other dysfunctional behaviors, including domestic violence and sexual abuse. Although the term was first coined in 1982, it wasn’t popularized as a concept until the late aughts (via an <a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/coercive-control-how-men-entrap-women-personal-life">influential book</a> on the subject) and still has yet to be fully or widely understood by the general public. More and more states are beginning to incorporate coercive control into their civil procedures and guidelines for understanding domestic violence, but as of 2024 only a handful of states, including <a href="https://www.domesticshelters.org/articles/legal/USA-coercive-control-laws">Hawaii</a> and <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2024/06/20/massachusetts-coercive-control/">Massachusetts</a>, actually prosecute coercive control as a criminal offense.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While most people recognize that strategic manipulation is a key factor in situations involving long-term domestic abuse, the justice system lacks sentencing guidelines that incorporate that understanding, including where juvenile and young offenders are concerned. In the case of Lyle and Erik Menendez, the court failed even to accept that prolonged abuse could be a defense to murder.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lyle and Erik were initially each tried separately in 1993; both trials, in which the defense relied heavily on testimony supporting their abuse claims, resulted in hung juries. The next trial began in October 1995, just eight days after the O.J. Simpson acquittal<strong> </strong>— the timing of which, the documentary implies, may have increased a public thirst for vengeance against wealthy defendants. For this trial, which saw them being tried together, the judge rejected what he called the “abuse excuse” and thus disallowed nearly all of the expert and personal testimony corroborating the brothers’ claims.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The jurors in that trial, according to one juror who appears in the documentary, were also dissuaded from considering manslaughter as an option, which could have dramatically reduced their sentences. Given the overwhelming number of witnesses who back their claims of an abusive household of coercive control and the increased understanding we have of how long-term abuse can affect children, it’s generally understood — and their defense attorneys have <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/menendez-bros-attorney-speaks-out-case-amid-appeal">argued</a> — that their trials would have gone much differently today. The law increasingly <a href="https://bwjp.org/site-resources/evidence-of-battering-and-the-defense-of-duress/">recognizes</a> coercive control and prolonged abuse as supporting a defense of diminished capacity, which can <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/diminished_capacity">frequently result</a> in a conviction on a lesser degree of a crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fortunately, the brothers have a shot at a reprieve: a recently rediscovered <a href="https://lamag.com/news/letter-calls-into-question-menendez-brothers-murder-conviction-attorneys-say">letter</a> purportedly written by Erik Menendez eight months before the murders in which he details his ongoing sexual abuse by Jose has been used as the basis for a motion to vacate the brothers’ convictions. A recent story in <a href="https://people.com/menendez-brothers-will-they-go-free-people-cover-story-8724654">People magazine</a> notes that the Los Angeles district attorney’s office will give the court a formal recommendation on the motion on November 26. That means the nightmare for the Menendez brothers could finally end.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The term “climate haven” never made much sense. After Hurricane Helene dumped two feet of rain on western North Carolina, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/10/01/asheville-climate-haven-flooding-hurricane/">many</a> <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-lede/climate-catastrophe-comes-to-asheville-north-carolina">major</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/nx-s1-5137024/climate-haven-hurricane-helene-asheville">media</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/climate/asheville-flooding-history-helene/index.html">outlets</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/01/hurricane-helene-asheville-climate-change-nowhere-safe">marveled</a> at how Asheville, which had been celebrated as a climate haven, had been devastated <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/09/climate/hurricane-helene-climate-change.html">by a climate-related disaster</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some in the media later reported accurately that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/climate/asheville-climate-change-flood.html">climate havens don’t actually exist</a>. But that still raises the question: Where did this climate haven concept even come from?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well before humans began putting billions of tons of greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere, entire populations would migrate toward better conditions in search of a place with milder weather or more fertile soil or the absence of drought.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because of its speed and scale, however, human-caused climate change is especially extreme, and everywhere will be impacted by some degree of risk. There is no completely safe haven.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which is part of how we ended up talking about the idea of climate havens. It’s wishful thinking. At least that’s what several experts told me after <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/374794/helene-flooding-hurricane-asheville-carolina">Helene laid a path of destruction across the Southeast</a> and as <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/376323/hurricane-milton-category-5-tampa-florida">Hurricane Milton barreled toward Florida</a>. As the impacts of climate change became more real and apparent, the media as well as local leaders started looking for a better story to tell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are desperate for optimism,” said <a href="https://architecture.tulane.edu/people/jesse-m-keenan">Jesse Keenan</a>, director of the Center on Climate Change and Urbanism at Tulane University, who described the concept of climate havens as a fiction. “It gives people hope.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Keenan actually blames himself for helping to popularize the term. For a concept that feels so widespread now, it’s surprisingly hard to find much mention of climate havens in the media before 2018. That was when the Guardian quoted Keenan in a piece about where you should move <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/24/climate-change-where-to-move-us-avoid-floods-hurricanes">to save yourself from climate change</a> that used the phrase “safe havens.” Buffalo, New York, and Duluth, Minnesota, were Keenan’s suggestions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The concept gained more traction a few months later, when Mayor Byron W. Brown referred to Buffalo as a “<a href="https://www.buffalony.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=342">climate refuge</a>” in his 2019 state of the city address, followed by outlets like <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-05/the-consequences-of-being-a-climate-refuge-city?sref=qYiz2hd0">Bloomberg</a> and <a href="https://qz.com/1895263/how-cities-can-prepare-to-support-climate-migrants">Quartz</a> referring to Buffalo as a climate haven. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/climate/climate-migration-duluth.html">did a whole spread on “climate-proof Duluth,”</a> a slogan Keenan wrote as part of an economic development package commissioned by the city. He told me it was just a joke that got pulled out of context.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to know how responsible one professor with a knack for marketing was for the mainstreaming of the climate haven concept. But it’s easy to see why local governments would latch onto it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Census Bureau estimates that as climate change warms the planet over the next several decades, 100 million <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-12/america-after-climate-change-mapped?sref=qYiz2hd0">will migrate into and around the </a>US. Increased flood risk <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43493-8">may have already pushed several million people</a> out of coastal and low-lying areas across the US, as wildfires <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50630-4">start to raise questions about migration</a> in the West.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inland cities, namely those along the Rust Belt that have been losing population for years, see an opportunity to pull those people in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The idea of a climate refuge itself is kind of an escapist fantasy,” said <a href="https://mcharg.upenn.edu/people/billy-fleming">Billy Fleming</a>, director of the McHarg Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “To the extent that a climate refuge even exists, it&#8217;s not a particularly physical or geophysical phenomenon. It&#8217;s social and economic.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fleming added that, for these would-be climate havens, attracting new residents is a means to pull in more tax revenue and create wealth for the community. “It&#8217;s about keeping the real estate machine churning,” he added, “which is the thing that pays for everything else in the city.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The real estate industry has taken notice. Quite coincidentally, as Hurricane Helene was bearing down on the Southeast last week, Zillow announced a new feature <a href="https://investors.zillowgroup.com/investors/news-and-events/news/news-details/2024/Zillow-introduces-First-Streets-comprehensive-climate-risk-data-on-for-sale-listings-across-the-US/default.aspx">that displays climate risk scores</a> on listing pages alongside interactive maps and insurance requirements. Now, you can look up an address and see, on a scale of one to 10, the risk of flooding, extreme temperatures, and wildfires for that property, based on data provided by <a href="https://firststreet.org/research-library/national-risk-reports">the climate risk modeling firm First Street</a>. Redfin, a Zillow competitor, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/02/13/redfin-air-quality-home-listings/">launched its own climate risk index</a> using First Street data earlier this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new climate risk scores on Zillow and Redfin can’t tell you with any certainty whether you’ll be affected by a natural disaster if you move into any given house. But this is a tool that can help guide decisions about how you might want to insure your property and think about its long-term value.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s almost fitting that Zillow and Redfin, platforms designed to help people find the perfect home, are doing the work to show that climate risk is not binary. There are no homes completely free of risk for the same reasons that there’s no such thing as a perfect climate haven.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Climate risk is a complicated equation that complicates the already difficult and complex calculus of buying a home. Better access to data about risk can help, and a bit more transparency about the insurance aspect of homeownership is especially useful, as the industry <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/377094/hurricane-milton-helene-home-insurance-flooding-damage">struggles to adapt to our warming world</a> and the disasters that come with it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As we start to see insurance costs increase, all that starts to impact that affordability question,” <a href="https://www.zillowgroup.com/people/skylar-olsen/">Skylar Olsen</a>, Zillow’s chief economist, told me. “It&#8217;ll help the housing market move towards a much healthier place, where buyers and sellers understand these risks and then have options to meet them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, knowledge of risk isn’t keeping people from moving <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/30/climate/americans-moving-hurricane-wildfire-risk.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;referringSource=articleShare&amp;sgrp=c-cb">to disaster-prone parts of the country</a> right now. People move to new parts of the country for countless different reasons, including the area’s natural beauty, job prospects, and affordable housing. Those are <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-dynamics/articles/10.3389/fhumd.2022.886545/full">a few of the reasons</a> why high-risk counties across the country <a href="https://econofact.org/are-americans-moving-to-locations-with-higher-climate-risk">are growing faster than low-risk counties</a>, even in the face of future climate catastrophes, which are both unpredictable and inevitable. It’s almost unfathomable to know how to prepare ourselves properly for the worst-case scenario.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The scale of these events that we&#8217;re seeing are so beyond what humans have ever seen,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pdx.edu/profile/vivek-shandas">Vivek Shandas</a>, an urban planning professor at Portland State University. “No matter what we think might be a manageable level of preparedness and infrastructure, we&#8217;re still going to see cracks, and we&#8217;re still going to see breakages.”<br>That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23872640/coastal-climate-ocean-rising-miami-florida-building">build sea walls</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/366765/megafires-climate-indigenous-controlled-burns">find new ways to fight wildfires</a>. In a sense, we have the opportunity to create our own climate havens by making cities more resilient to the risks they face. We can be optimistic about that future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Floridians are bracing themselves for Hurricane Milton, among the strongest storms ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean, less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene devastated the US Southeast. With wind speeds pushing over 180 miles per hour, Milton is expected to make landfall in western Florida on Wednesday. Storm surge in the densely populated Tampa Bay area, which is projected to experience a direct hit, could reach 15 feet, <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT4+shtml/071735.shtml?">according to</a> the National Hurricane Center.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helene left Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia to battle with record storm surge, wind damage, and catastrophic flooding. Over 230 people were killed across the six states and millions of homes and businesses were left without power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The monstrous storms follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/373874/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-warm-ocean-water">a summer lull</a> in what’s been projected to be an especially active hurricane season, which could extend through November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/glossip-v-oklahoma-3/"><em>Glossip v. Oklahoma</em></a> is currently before the Supreme Court — and it is one of the most muddled death penalty cases the Court has faced in a while. Exactly how the justices untangle it will decide whether a man lives or dies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Richard Glossip is on death row after being convicted of an Oklahoma murder 20 years ago. Now, however, the state’s Republican attorney general says that <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip">his trial was unconstitutional and his conviction must be tossed out</a>. The state plans to retry Glossip if his conviction is vacated, but a ruling in Glossip’s favor will get him off death row for now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet Attorney General Gentner Drummond has struggled to find a legal forum that will actually take the assertion that his trial was unconstitutional seriously. Oklahoma’s highest criminal court refused to accept Drummond’s arguments and kept Glossip on death row. The state parole board, meanwhile, split 2-2 on whether to grant clemency to Glossip, in part because one member of the board had to recuse himself because his wife was the lead prosecutor against Glossip.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wednesday morning’s oral argument in <em>Glossip</em> only added more confusion to the mix. The two justices who typically take the most hardline positions against criminal defendants, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, appeared determined to toss the case out completely, without ever actually considering whether Glossip’s constitutional rights were violated. They likely have an ally in Chief Justice John Roberts, who seemed to doubt whether any possible constitutional violation in this case actually mattered enough to change the outcome of Glossip’s trial.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Justice Neil Gorsuch, who often votes with the Court’s most hardline members <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/17-8151_1qm2.pdf">in death penalty cases</a>, is recused from the case for reasons the Court did not disclose. That’s actually bad news for Glossip because he must assemble five affirmative votes to toss out his conviction in order to prevail, and the loss of even a skeptical justice is one less potential vote for him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All three of the Court’s Democrats, meanwhile, appeared sympathetic to Glossip’s arguments, and spent much of the case batting down Alito’s proposals to dismiss the case on procedural grounds — though Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson showed some openness to forming an alliance with Thomas to send the case back down to the state courts in order to gather additional evidence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That leaves Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, conservative Republicans who asked some questions that appeared sympathetic to Glossip, as the wild cards in this case. It is possible that they could provide the fourth and fifth vote to save Glossip’s life, but far from certain.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The alleged constitutional violation that is before the Court — that prosecutors withheld evidence that a key witness has a serious mental illness, and failed to correct this witness when he lied on the stand — is <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip">fairly marginal</a>. It turns on four words in handwritten notes by prosecutor Connie Smothermon that were not turned over to Glossip’s lawyers until January 2023. The state agrees with Glossip’s legal team that these four words reveal a sufficiently serious constitutional violation to justify giving him a new trial.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while this narrow legal issue, which is the only issue before the Supreme Court, is the kind of legal question that reasonable judges could disagree upon, Smothermon’s notes are only one piece of a wide range of evidence suggesting that Glossip’s criminal conviction is unconstitutional: Oklahoma conducted two independent investigations, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip">both of which concluded that Glossip’s trial was fundamentally flawed</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among other things, those investigations found that Justin Sneed — the man who actually committed the murder at issue here — was pressured by police to implicate Glossip in the crime. They also show that police and the prosecution lost or destroyed evidence that could potentially exonerate Glossip. And they show that police inexplicably did not question potentially important witnesses or search obvious places for evidence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, however, Glossip’s life likely turns upon whether Kavanaugh and Barrett are moved by the procedural arguments pressed by the Court’s right flank, or by the arguments pressed by both Glossip and the state: That four words in Smothermon’s notes reveal a serious constitutional violation.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Smothermon’s notes matter so much</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, prosecutors turned over a box of evidence for the first time to Glossip’s legal team. This box included handwritten notes from Smothermon, which included two significant questions. In the corner of the notes, Smothermon <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/373245/supreme-court-oklahoma-death-penalty-richard-glossip">wrote the words “on lithium?” and “Dr. Trumpet?”</a></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/glossip-note-supreme-court.webp?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.3762739654562,100,89.247452069088" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="An excerpt from a prosecutor’s handwritten notes regarding Sneed and the Glossip case. Glossip v. Oklahoma brief." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Both the state and Glossip’s legal team quickly discovered that these somewhat cryptic notes were quite significant. As the state <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-7466/308265/20240423202240962_2024-4-23%20Final%20OK%20AG%20Glossip%20merits%20brief.pdf">told the justices in its brief</a>, when Sneed was incarcerated in the Oklahoma County jail, that “jail had just one working psychiatrist in 1997 when Sneed was held there: Dr. Larry Trombka.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both Glossip and the state agree that the “Dr. Trumpet” referenced by Smothermon must have been a reference to Dr. Trombka, who was “the only possible treating psychiatrist and the only medical professional at the jail qualified to prescribe lithium.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The state had also previously withheld Sneed’s medical records from Glossip’s lawyers, and these records “confirm a diagnosis of bipolar disorder with a treatment of lithium at the county jail.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this matters because Sneed was the key witness against Glossip at his trial. He was the only witness who implicated Glossip in the murder, and he did so on the theory that Glossip, who managed a motel where Sneed worked, hired Glossip to kill the motel’s owner.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Dr. Trombka later said that Sneed’s mental illness could have triggered a “manic episode” that would have made him “more paranoid or potentially violent.” Trombka added that Sneed’s condition was “exacerbated by illicit drug use, such as methamphetamine.” So, if Glossip’s defense lawyers had known about Sneed’s medical diagnosis, they could have argued that Sneed committed the murder because he experienced a serious mental health event, and not because he was coaxed into doing so by Glossip.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During Glossip’s trial, moreover, Sneed did testify that he was given lithium at the jail, but he suggested that he was prescribed it by accident and that he “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-7466/308265/20240423202240962_2024-4-23%20Final%20OK%20AG%20Glossip%20merits%20brief.pdf">never seen no psychiatrist or anything</a>.” Thus, Smothermon’s notes do not simply suggest that Sneed lied on the stand — a fact that would have diminished his credibility with the jury — they also suggest that Smothermon knew Sneed was lying and failed to correct him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The failure to turn over Smothermon’s notes sooner, and Smothermon’s failure to correct Sneed’s testimony potentially violate the Constitution in two ways. In <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/373/83/"><em>Brady v. Maryland</em></a> (1963), the Supreme Court held that prosecutors must turn over evidence to the defense that is “favorable to an accused” if that evidence “is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/360/264/"><em>Napue v. Illinois</em></a> (1959), the Court held that “a conviction obtained through use of false evidence, known to be such by representatives of the State, must fall under the Fourteenth Amendment.” This rule applies even “when the State, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears.” So, by failing to correct Sneed’s false testimony that he never saw a psychiatrist, Smothermon potentially violated <em>Napue</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, the significance of Smothermon’s notes and her alleged violation of <em>Napue</em> appeared to divide the justices. Roberts was particularly skeptical of their relevance, pointing out early in the argument that the defense counsel knew that Sneed had been prescribed lithium, so why does it matter if defense lawyers had also known that this drug, which is used primarily to treat mental health disorders, was also prescribed by a psychiatrist?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Significantly, however, Kavanaugh appeared to break with Roberts on this question. “I’m having some trouble,” he told Christopher Michel, a Court-appointed lawyer tasked with defending Glossip’s conviction because the state would not, with the idea that the jury would be unmoved if they learned that Sneed lied on the stand “when the whole case depended on his credibility.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kavanaugh also said that Sneed’s mental health diagnosis creates “all sorts of avenues for questioning his credibility.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So Kavanaugh, at least, appears open to the argument that Smothermon violated <em>Napue </em>or <em>Brady</em>. But it is still unclear whether five justices agree with this argument. And it is also unclear how they will approach a procedural issue that could doom Glossip’s case.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The procedural problem in the <em>Glossip</em> case</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oklahoma law, like most states and the federal government, places strict limits on anyone’s ability to challenge their conviction once that conviction is finalized and all of the defendant’s appeals are exhausted. Among other things, Oklahoma forbids someone like Glossip from making more than one post-conviction attack on that conviction unless the issues raised in a later proceeding <a href="https://casetext.com/case/glossip-v-state-2">could not have been raised earlier</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These barriers, moreover, are augmented by an Oklahoma state law that required Glossip to present any new evidence he discovered <a href="http://okcca.net/rules/rule-9.7/">within 60 days of discovering it</a>. So Glossip’s lawyers could not take their time, gather all the evidence they needed to make the best case for their client, and then present it to the courts all at once. They had to present this evidence piecemeal or lose the ability to raise it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, the case currently before the Supreme Court is Glossip’s fifth legal proceeding challenging his conviction after it was finalized.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before this fifth proceeding reached the justices, moreover, Oklahoma’s highest criminal court rejected his <em>Brady </em>and <em>Napue</em> arguments, in part because, the court claimed, Oklahoma’s laws limiting his ability to repeatedly challenge his conviction prevented him from raising those arguments. If the Oklahoma court is right about this point, that precludes the Supreme Court from hearing the case, because the US Supreme Court typically <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/4/23481063/supreme-court-moore-harper-independent-state-legislature-doctrine-elections">cannot overrule a state’s highest court on a question of state law</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, most of Wednesday’s argument focused on this threshold question — does Oklahoma’s own law prevent Glossip from even raising his <em>Napue</em> and <em>Brady</em> arguments? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that Oklahoma’s attorney general is on Glossip’s side in this case plays an enormous role in the debate over this threshold question. Were Glossip alone in seeking relief, he would probably be doomed. But several justices argued that Drummond has an absolute right to waive the procedural rules that would otherwise prevent Glossip from raising his <em>Brady</em> and <em>Napue</em> claims.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, one of the justices who seemed to agree that Drummond has waived those procedural rules is Barrett, who noted at one point that it is very unusual for a court not to accept such a waiver. Similarly, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued that there are “100 years of history” where no Oklahoma court refused to honor a similar waiver, suggesting that the state court that heard Glossip’s case made up a one-time-only rule to prevent him from challenging his conviction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet, while at least four justices seemed convinced that the state court should have honored Drummond’s decision to waive the procedural bars to Glossip’s case, it is unclear whether there are five. Kavanaugh, the most likely fifth vote for Glossip, played his cards especially close to his chest, often framing his questions about whether Smothermon violated <em>Napue </em>or <em>Brady </em>with caveats like “if you get past all the procedural bars.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the bottom line is that Glossip could prevail, but he’s got a tough road. Assuming that all three of the Democratic justices are on his side, he needs to win over Barrett — who seemed to be with him on the procedural question but who was largely quiet on the merits of his case — while also winning over Kavanaugh, who seemed to be with Glossip on the merits but silent on the procedural question.</p>

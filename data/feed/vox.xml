<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s undeniable: the era of Chappell Roan is upon us. At music festivals and on the lists forecasting <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/chappell-roan-5-things-know-090855914.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEefUpnkTaIJpRuEbR6dE8g5e8t3nu9bxSbG-mFk3deSmqQseg2Xmsg51irNEqZ3m3ocr0VrQCUQ5pmmLthbiscRQAPsECNMFwIwcpklVdeo-dS_3mOVBmbh0PJ6i8XuouS6Ft8w8qPXFF3zbm0RKAMXGEpx0cZJyXZ70EIFkZk5">pop’s</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin">next</a> <a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/chappell-roan-big-year-interview-coachella-performance">big</a> <a href="https://industryme.co.uk/born-this-way-the-rise-of-chappell-roan/">thing</a>, there she is: big red hair and big powerhouse voice, unapologetically queer lyrics and exuberant drag queen aesthetic. This is the summer Chappell Roan became impossible to ignore. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan has been a working pop artist for years. Now 26, she signed her first record deal with Atlantic Records at 17 and has been putting out songs ever since — but for a long time, none of them seemed to quite hit. Last September, though, Roan released her first full album, <em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</em>, and set off on tour as Olivia Rodrigo’s opener. In March, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4WiXKGCJhg">her appearance on NPR’s Tiny Desk Concert series</a> went surprisingly viral (3.4 million views and counting), sending her <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/sabrina-carpenter-chappell-roan-are-pop-stars-in-the-making-how-opening-tour-gigs-tiktok-and-coachella-are-keys-to-their-success-215444839.html">Spotify monthly listeners count</a> rocketing up by 500 percent. In April, she became one of the <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/music-features/coachella-2024-review-best-acts-3618348">biggest stories out of Coachella</a>. In June, she was the story of the <a href="https://people.com/chappell-roan-dresses-as-statue-of-liberty-governors-ball-statement-about-freedom-8660637">Governor’s Ball</a>. She’s been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L94zTNhLnXo">on Jimmy Fallon</a>. She’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOg93THAyE0">performed on <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em></a>. She is currently in the process of crossing the border that separates “working pop artist” and “pop star.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that makes Roan’s story so compelling is how long it took her to get here and what a strikingly different artist and performer she was at the beginning of the journey. Today, a Chappell Roan show plays like a joyous drag ball. A few years ago, Roan was making broody Lorde-meets-Florence Welch power ballads about suffering deliciously for the love of a boy. She pitched her voice deep and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkyqkv/cursive-singing-tiktok-trend-explained">sang her lyrics in smooth, diphthonged cursive</a>. In her videos, she wore her hair dark and straight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan’s trajectory from there to here reveals a lot about why, exactly, she’s taking off so precipitously right now. It’s the story of coming of age, both artistically and personally, at exactly the right time and place. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Kayleigh became Chappell</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan grew up with the name Kayleigh Amstutz. She lived in what she sometimes describes as a <a href="https://www.polyesterzine.com/features/chappell-roan-audience-participation-playing-a-character-and-being-horny">trailer park</a> in Willard, Missouri, <a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Willard_city,_Missouri?g=160XX00US2979882">population 6,000</a>. Her childhood was deeply conservative. She went to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin">church three times a week</a>, she said in an interview with the Guardian, and was taught that “being gay was bad and a sin.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I wish it was better. I wish I had better things to say,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">she told Rolling Stone</a> in 2022. “But mentally, I had a really tough time.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her family and peers found out she could sing when they heard her in a middle school talent show, and she signed to Atlantic Records after she was scouted posting songs to YouTube. Flying back and forth between her parents’ home in Missouri and studios in LA and New York, she got to work. She released her first single, “Good Hurt,” in August 2017, and her first EP <em>School Nights</em> a month later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Already, she had decided that she would not be performing as Kayleigh Amstutz. Instead, <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/entertainment/2017/08/17/chappell-roan-singer-willard-she-just-made-big-time/548315001/">she created a stage name</a> in honor of her grandfather, Dennis Chappell, and his favorite song, “The Strawberry Roan.” </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>A few years ago, Roan was making broody Lorde-meets-Florence Welch power ballads about suffering deliciously for the love of a boy</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;The picking of the name was the hardest part of this entire thing,&#8221; <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/entertainment/2017/08/17/chappell-roan-singer-willard-she-just-made-big-time/548315001/">Roan confided in her hometown newspaper</a>, The Springfield News-Leader, in the lead-up to releasing <em>School Nights</em> in 2017. &#8220;It was the most stressful part.&#8221; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few years later, Roan had a different perspective on this part of her life. All of it seemed strange to her, stressful in its own way. “I felt very unprepared,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">she told Rolling Stone</a>. “I didn’t know the consequences of how much I had to sacrifice. I didn’t do my senior year. I didn’t go to prom. I didn’t go to graduation. I missed a lot of what would have been the end of my childhood to do this job.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, the job was to sing dark, moody songs about the sadomasochistic thrill of being in love with a bad boy. “No one else compares to who I had first,” Roan sings in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEWNgO0F9k">Good Hurt</a>” as she submerges herself somberly in a lake of black water in the accompanying video. “All I really want is a good hurt.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Chappell Roan - Good Hurt (Official Music Video)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bmEWNgO0F9k?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan of this era was a markedly different performer from the Roan we know now. There was no hint of queerness in her presentation yet, with her songs addressed mainly to an unnamed “<a href="https://genius.com/Chappell-roan-sugar-high-lyrics">beautiful boy</a>.” With her long hair worn dark and straight, she gave off a witchy aura, an impression she magnified by gliding around in long white gowns — a far cry from the gleefully tacky drag get-ups she wears now. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps most striking of all, the aesthetic Roan used in the 2010s doesn’t feel like one particular to her. She was doing a variation of the melancholy indie pop sound and look that was then in vogue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467">Roan now describes her sound of this era as</a> “really dark, angsty pop that was pretty boring.” Her magnetic presence and vocal chops were enough to garner her a small and fervent fanbase, but it wasn’t yet a group large enough to reach critical mass.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everything changed, Roan has said in interviews, when she left Missouri to live full time in Los Angeles on her own in 2018. For the first time, she was able to separate herself from the conservative ideology of her childhood.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I was told this city is demonic and Satanists live here,” <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467">Roan told NME this February</a>. “But when I got to West Hollywood, it opened my eyes [to the fact] that everything I was afraid of wasn’t always true — especially [what I’d been told] about the queer community. Going to gay clubs for the first time, it felt spiritual.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was also in LA that Roan met the man who would become her primary creative collaborator: Dan Nigro, a music producer and former indie frontman. He and Roan  began collaborating just a few months before Nigro broke out in a huge way for his work on Olivia Rodrigo’s “Driver’s License.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first collaboration Nigro and Roan released together was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR3Liudev18">Pink Pony Club</a>,” which dropped in April 2020. There, we start to see the beginning of what we now know as Chappell Roan: hair worn loose and curly, vulnerability pushed forward but shame exuberantly chased away.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Chappell Roan - Pink Pony Club (Official Music Video)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GR3Liudev18?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Pink Pony Club” is a story song Roan has said was inspired by her first trip to the Abbey, an institution in LA’s gay nightlife scene. She was transfixed by the go-go dancers, and so she wrote a song about a woman from a small town who leaves her scandalized mother behind to become a stripper at the Pink Pony Club. Roan had sung all her previous songs in the deep indie girl slur that was popular at the time, but she does “Pink Pony Club” in a voice so precise it starts to feel like a burlesque.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“<em>God</em>, what have you <em>done</em>?” wails the narrator’s mother in the chorus, with Roan coming down hard on the d’s and the t’s, her falsetto bright and airy. “Oh mama, I&#8217;m just having fun,” the narrator responds, and although the song is in a minor key, Roan’s voice is joyous: “On the stage in my heels, it&#8217;s where I belong.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately for Roan, April 2020 was not a time that welcomed raucous odes to the dance club. When “Pink Pony Club” dropped into the traumatic early days of the pandemic, it sank like a stone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The song was also <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467">unpopular at her label</a>, which disapproved of Roan turning her back so abruptly on the aesthetic she’d begun to craft in <em>School Nights</em>. Roan released only two more songs with Atlantic: the light love ballad “<a href="https://youtu.be/0SfI95-XIqU?si=xYK-CHWLXetEukRD">Love Me Anyway</a>” and the melancholy “<a href="https://youtu.be/GcXlN7meclE?si=7xSlEVN8IHIbaeCy">California</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“California” is a sort of response to and inverse of “Pink Pony Club.” Like its predecessor, it tells the story of a dreamer who left her small town for a love of delicious sin in LA. Unlike the main character in “Pink Pony Club,” the narrator of “California” feels increasingly like she’s failed by coming to the city and that everything she’s sacrificed has been for nothing. “Won’t make my mama proud,” Roan sings with mounting excitement in “Pink Pony Club.” “I let you down,” she sings on a down note in “California.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ten days after “California” was released, in August 2020, Atlantic officially dropped Roan from the label. Her music, they said, was underperforming. The same week, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">her relationship with the man she’d been seeing for four and a half years ended</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Midwest princess rises</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I felt like a failure, but I knew deep down I wasn’t,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin">Roan told the Guardian in 2023</a>. She moved back home to Willard, Missouri, got a job working the drive-thru window at a coffee kiosk, and plotted her next move. She wanted to give herself time to recalibrate and save money before going back to LA and trying music again. She would give herself a year there to make it before giving in and enrolling in college. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, little by little, Roan was beginning to develop a cult following, without any official backing from the music industry. “Pink Pony Club” was becoming a bona fide sleeper hit as it took off across TikTok and through word of mouth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Here’s a totally reasonable proposal for song of summer 2021: a single that dropped more than a full year ago, in April 2020, to essentially no fanfare, by a 21-year-old singer-songwriter who hasn’t even cracked 4,000 followers on Twitter,” <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/song-recommendation-chappell-roan-pink-pony-club.html">announced Vulture in 2021</a>, describing “Pink Pony Club” as “a pop hit from an alternate timeline that somehow ended up in ours by accident.” The song wasn’t charting yet, not even close, but it was starting to get attention in all the right places.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Nigro had been helping Olivia Rodrigo craft and release her hit debut studio album, <em>Sour.</em> In November 2021, with Rodrigo launched, Nigro and Roan reunited. Roan was feeling listless and ignored, she says, and Nigro gave her the impetus she needed to start working for herself. “[Dan] was just looking at me and goes ‘You are going to run your career into the fucking ground if you don’t start doing shit on your own,’” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">Roan told Rolling Stone in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March 2022, Roan released “<a href="https://youtu.be/nXZuv1T8bfg?si=Sfu9KPq3laClLfbS">Naked in Manhattan</a>,” her first song as an independent artist, without the backing of a music label. She shot the accompanying video with friends in thrifted wardrobe on the streets of New York City.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The song sees Roan crushing on a girl friend, hoping to finally cross the line and kiss her. “Boys suck, and girls I’ve never tried,” she sings. In real life, she says, the lyric was true when she wrote it. “I was dating a boy then,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">Roan told the LA Times last August</a>. “I had never even kissed a girl when these songs [“Naked in Manhattan” and “Red Wine Supernova”] were written. It was all what I wished my life could be.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Chappell Roan - Naked in Manhattan (Official Music Video)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXZuv1T8bfg?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Naked in Manhattan” continues the aesthetic project Roan found in “Pink Pony Club” and develops it. It’s Roan’s first explicitly queer song. (“Pony Club” covers its coming-out narrative in a thin veil of plausible deniability.) It’s also the first to feature the spoken word interlude that would become a go-to move for her. The accompanying video also debuts the “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">thrift store pop star</a>” drag queen style that became her calling card: fire engine red hair, elaborate hyper-femme outfits cobbled together from thrift store pieces, a pinup girl burlesque cheekiness. It was a sign that Roan had at last found a new image that she loved. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March 2022, Roan was announced as the opener for Olivia Rodrigo and Fletcher. She continued releasing independent singles: “<a href="https://youtu.be/ePsqyPMIg6I?si=d-PcUErh9GQdzuhw">Karma</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdaKBAuO8zg">Femininomenon</a>” in August 2022, and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfSjnsYiY_A">Casual</a>” in October. In February 2023, she launched her own national tour.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the while, she was developing the character of “Chappell Roan” beyond just a stage name into a fully distinct persona like those used by the drag queens she had come to idolize. “Don’t call me baby, and don’t call me Kayleigh,” she would say at the opening of her shows. When she was performing, she stopped being Kayleigh and Chappell took over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chappell was all the things Kayleigh was ashamed of, made newly exuberant and joyful. She wore clownish white-face makeup because “that’s what the <a href="https://www.papermag.com/chappell-roan-trixie-mattel#rebelltitem2">country boys called gay people in my hometown. Clowns.</a>” She plays campily with the signifiers of her small-town background: <a href="https://5centsound.com/blog/house-of-chappell">yodeling vocal trills and camo-print merch</a>. Perhaps most significantly, she is unapologetically sexual in ways that her creator cannot quite bring herself to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I have such a difficult time — as Kayleigh — with sex,” she said in an <a href="https://www.polyesterzine.com/features/chappell-roan-audience-participation-playing-a-character-and-being-horny">interview with Polyester Zine in 2023</a>. “I have a hard time watching sex scenes or flirting with people! I get really uncomfortable with hyper sexual things. But as the drag queen that I play, Chappell, she&#8217;s not like that &#8211; she is very confident and comfortable singing about those things.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Don’t call me baby, and don’t call me Kayleigh,” she would say at the opening of her shows</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March 2023, Roan announced that she had signed to Nigro’s new label, Amusement Records, in partnership with Island Records.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Roan, by then, she had options. “I met with nine labels and I went in with the attitude [of], ‘This is what I need — the only thing I need right now is money,’” she told <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/music-interviews/chappell-roan-interview-red-wine-supernova-debut-album-radar-3458322">NME</a>. “So if you don’t give me this, this and this, I’m just not going to sign with you because I can keep going on my own. I was very picky and I had a fuck ton of leverage.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan wasn’t wrong. She had all that leverage because it was clear that her moment was arriving. Now, after years of trying on personas that didn’t quite fit, of working bad day jobs and living with roommates, of scrabbling studio time and music videos together without a label to back her, it’s finally here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A drag queen pop star in a time of moral panic</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking back over the arc of Roan’s career, it becomes clear that her music got really good and her career started to take off once she had a strong sense of who she was as an individual. That sense of self is intertwined with Roan defining herself as a queer woman.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The energy of <em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</em> comes from the palpable joy of finding oneself and rejecting old beliefs. “Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine,” Roan instructs her sapphic crush in “Naked in Manhattan,” adding with a verbal shrug, “Could go to hell but we’ll probably be fine.” The Chappell Roan of “Good Hurt” might have believed she would go to hell if she kissed a girl. The Chappell Roan of “Naked in Manhattan” doesn’t much care either way, even if the person who wrote the lyrics hasn’t quite gotten there herself yet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If <em>Midwest Princess</em> is a celebration of finding oneself, Chappell Roan the character is the personification of that glee. Chappell, with her white-face makeup and princessy gowns that are just a little off, expresses what her creator longs for and cannot quite reach herself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The whole project is to honor my 10-year-old self. My whole persona is just me trying to honor that version of myself that I was never allowed to be,” <a href="https://www.papermag.com/chappell-roan-trixie-mattel#rebelltitem2">she told Paper in June</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is probably not just coincidence that America fell in love with Chappell Roan at the same time that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/9/7/23860447/supreme-court-drag-shows-ban-tennessee-montana-texas-florida-queens">drag shows are becoming criminalized</a>. As lawmakers position drag queens as monstrous threats to children, Roan stands for drag as the thing that saved an unhappy child, a joy, a marvelous act of creation. Her artistic project is about finding her self-identity, and as soon as she found that self, she made her a drag queen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What makes Chappell Roan so compelling to watch is that as a character, she stands for a profound release, an unshaming. She is the artistic culmination of a long search for self-discovery, and you can hear the joy and celebration of that search in the music. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is, she’s the culmination for now. Who knows what’s coming next?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricane season has begun, and it’s off to a frightening start.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Beryl, the first named hurricane of the year,&nbsp;pummeled into tropical islands in the southeast Caribbean as a Category 4 storm. The Grenadines and other islands in the Lesser Antilles including St. Lucia and Grenada are facing fierce winds and life-threatening flooding.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The storm, which is heading west toward Central America, is already record-breaking. Beryl became a Category 4 hurricane earlier — and more easterly — than any previously recorded storm. It also intensified at record speeds for a storm this early in the year, jumping from Category 1 to Category 4 in less than 24 hours.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caribbean nations are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes, for the obvious reason that they often lie in their paths. These storms typically form in the Atlantic Ocean, west of northern Africa, and then travel west. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Caribbean islands also have one of the world’s best defense systems against superstorms like Beryl. That system is hidden under the waves, it’s free, and it’s all-natural. It’s coral reefs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"> Indeed, most Caribbean nations are surrounded by a colorful patchwork of coral reefs, living animals that function as natural seawalls. These hard, rocklike creatures help dampen waves and reduce flooding. Research shows that coral reefs help dozens of countries avert billions of dollars in flood damage each year, in the Caribbean and globally.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem, more pressing now than ever, is that these lifesaving ecosystems are vanishing —&nbsp;for the very same reason hurricanes are becoming more destructive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">An all-natural hurricane defense system&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Each piece of coral on a reef is actually a colony of tiny animals, called polyps. Those polyps build skeletons out of calcium carbonate, not unlike a snail growing a shell, which form the structure of the reef.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s these coral skeletons that safeguard coastlines during a storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Simply put, waves lose energy when they ram into coral reefs. The bigger and taller the reef, the more wave energy it dissipates, for the same reason that coastal cities use breakwaters made of rocks to protect the shoreline. Remarkably, studies show that coral reefs can dissipate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4794">more than 90 percent</a> of wave energy. Waves with less energy are smaller and slower and don’t deal as much damage when they reach the shore.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even a small difference in a reef’s height can make a big difference in risk. Flood risk is often measured by what’s called the 100-year flood zone — an area in which the chance of a flood in a given year is 1 percent. If coral reefs in the US lose 1 meter of height, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/value-us-coral-reefs-risk-reduction">a study</a> found, that zone in the US would grow by 104 square kilometers (or about 26,000 acres, nearly twice the size of Manhattan), putting about 51,000 more people at risk of flooding.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1491221549.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.041829306103,100,69.916341387793" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">This service —&nbsp;which coral reefs supply for free —&nbsp;is worth a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the US, including Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, coral reefs help safeguard the homes of more than 18,000 people and avert $1.8 billion in flood damage each year, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/value-us-coral-reefs-risk-reduction">according</a> to a 2019 study by the US Geological Survey (USGS). Slightly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5997709/">older research</a> found that, globally, this number is more than $4 billion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Without reefs, annual damages would more than double,” authors of the latter study, published in <em>Nature Communications, </em>wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caribbean nations are among those that benefit most from coral reefs and the damage they prevent. In the <em>Nature Communications </em>study, published in 2018, researchers ranked countries by how much flood damage coral reefs avert, relative to their GDP. Eight of the top 10 are Caribbean nations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No. 3 is Grenada,&nbsp;where Hurricane Beryl made landfall Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Vanishing reefs</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the benefits that reefs provide make losing them that much scarier. And we are indeed losing them, especially in the warm(ing) waters of the Caribbean.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The area of live hard corals on Caribbean reefs has fallen by about <a href="https://www.epa.gov/coral-reefs/us-coral-reefs">80 percent</a> in recent decades. In some regions, like the Florida Keys, the declines are <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23868423/florida-coral-reef-bleaching-heat-wave-climate-change">even steeper</a>.&nbsp;Compared to the 1970s, most Caribbean reefs are <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24137250/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-change">almost unrecognizable today</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elkhorn coral — a species resembling moose antlers known for its wave-weakening abilities  —&nbsp;is especially endangered. In the 1970s, it grew across more than 30 percent of Caribbean reefs. By the 1980s, coverage of the coral had fallen to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37858-2">less than 2 percent</a>, a number that has likely only shrunk further in the years since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A number of human behaviors have destroyed Caribbean coral, from coastal construction to fishing, as have some seemingly natural threats, like disease. The most enduring and existential problem, however, is climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warming ocean water causes a fundamental relationship between coral and a symbiotic algae living inside it to break down. When it does, coral begins to turn white —&nbsp;or “bleach” —&nbsp;and starve. Bleached corals often have more trouble surviving other threats and die.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means climate change is not only making tropical storms more severe, but it can also weaken our natural defenses against them.&nbsp;And this is an important, frightening point: A warming ocean makes storms more dangerous, not just because they’re intensifying faster or dropping more rain but because, in places like the Caribbean, we’re losing resilience that iconic ecosystems provide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you spent Monday morning following each of the cases handed down by the Supreme Court, you’re probably experiencing a bit of whiplash.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest news out of the Court on Monday, of course, is a sweeping decision holding that former President Donald Trump was effectively <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">allowed to do crimes while he was in office</a>. Indeed, under the six Republican justices’ decision in <em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">Trump v. United States</a></em>, it is very likely that a sitting president can order the military to assassinate his political rivals without facing any criminal consequences for doing so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just a few minutes before the Supreme Court handed down its <em>Trump</em> decision, however, it also handed down another case reaffirming that the First Amendment does not permit Republican-led legislatures to seize control of what content is published by media companies. That decision, in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-277_d18f.pdf"><em>Moody v. Netchoice</em></a>, was 6-3, with three Republican justices who also held that the leader of the Republican Party was allowed to commit many crimes while he was in office joining Justice Elena Kagan’s majority opinion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, on the same day that the Supreme Court appears to have established that a sitting president can commit the most horrible crimes imaginable <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">against someone who dares to speak out against him</a>, the same Court — with three justices joining both decisions — holds that the First Amendment still imposes some limits on the government’s ability to control what content appears online.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined both decisions in full. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the <em>Netchoice </em>opinion in full, plus nearly all of the <em>Trump</em> decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s impossible to comprehend the value system that would lead a justice to join both decisions, but nevertheless here we are. That said, the Court’s decision in <em>Netchoice</em> is a victory for free speech, even if it comes the same day as one of the most chilling decisions in the Court’s history.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s at stake in <em>Netchoice</em>?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Netchoice</em> concerns two state laws, one from Florida and one from Texas, which seek to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/22/23883888/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment-netchoice-paxton-murthy-missouri-twitter-facebook">control what content must be published by major social media platforms</a> such as Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube. Both laws were enacted by Republican legislatures, and signed by Republican governors, for the very purpose of forcing these platforms to publish right-leaning content that they would prefer not to publish.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said before signing his state’s law, it was enacted to stop an allegedly “dangerous movement by social media companies to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/22/23883888/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment-netchoice-paxton-murthy-missouri-twitter-facebook">silence conservative viewpoints and ideas</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two laws, and especially the Texas law, are extraordinarily broad. Texas’s, for example, prohibits major social media companies from moderating content based on “<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/872/billtext/html/HB00020S.htm">the viewpoint of the user or another person</a>” or on “the viewpoint represented in the user’s expression or another person’s expression.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s such a sweeping restriction on content moderation that it would forbid companies like YouTube or Twitter from removing content that is abusive, that promotes violence, or that seeks to overthrow the United States government. Indeed, Kagan’s opinion includes a bullet-pointed list of eight subject matters that the Texas law would not permit the platforms to moderate, including posts that <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-277_d18f.pdf">“support Nazi ideology” or that “encourage teenage suicide and self-injury.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, Kagan makes clear that this sort of government takeover of social media moderation is not allowed, and she repeatedly rebukes the far-right US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which upheld the Texas law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Kagan writes, the First Amendment does not permit the government to force platforms “to carry and promote user speech that they would rather discard or downplay.” She also cites several previous Supreme Court decisions that support this proposition, including its “seminal” decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3261378222094247847&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo</em></a> (1974), which held that a newspaper has the right to final control over “the choice of material to go into” it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nothing in Kagan’s opinion breaks new legal ground — it is <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/22/23883888/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment-netchoice-paxton-murthy-missouri-twitter-facebook">very well-established</a> that the government cannot seize editorial control over the media, for reasons that should be obvious to anyone who cares the least bit about freedom of speech and of the press. But the Court’s reaffirmation of this ordinary and once uncontested legal principle is still jarring on the same day that the Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">handed down a blueprint for a Trump dictatorship</a> in its presidential immunity case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth noting that Kagan’s decision is technically a victory for Texas and Florida, although on such narrow grounds that this victory is unlikely to matter.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Kagan’s <em>Netchoice</em> decision actually says</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The specific holding of the <em>Netchoice</em> opinion turns on a distinction between a “facial” challenge to a state law, and a more limited “as-applied” challenge.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A facial challenge, which is what the social media platforms brought against Texas and Florida’s unconstitutional laws, alleges that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications and must be effectively removed from the books in its entirety. That contrasts with an “as-applied” challenge, which merely alleges that a law is unconstitutional when it is enforced against a particular plaintiff in a particular context.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Facial challenges, however, are notoriously difficult to win. Ordinarily, as Kagan writes, a plaintiff must show that “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-277_d18f.pdf">no set of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid</a>,” though it is somewhat easier to win such a case in the First Amendment context.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Kagan’s <em>Netchoice</em> opinion lays out why the Texas and Florida laws are unconstitutional as applied to social media companies’ core product — a curated list of content authored by social media users — both laws are so broadly drafted that they also may apply to less core features at websites like Facebook or Twitter, such as “direct messaging or events management.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kagan faults the lower courts for failing to separately evaluate whether the laws can constitutionally be applied to these non-core features, and sends the case back down to those lower courts to do that work. That said, the bulk of her opinion is quite clear that the laws cannot constitutionally be applied to core features like Facebook’s Newsfeed or YouTube’s homepage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, on the same day that the Supreme Court holds presidents above the law, it also appears to rule that lesser public officials still must comply with the First Amendment.</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beryl is poised to continue moving westward across the Caribbean Sea toward Jamaica over the coming days, bringing life-threatening rain and wind. The storm is expected to weaken as it reaches Mexico by the weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As unprecedented as the storm may be, it lines up with what scientists have been predicting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Atlantic Ocean has been gathering the raw materials for a raucous hurricane season for months and is now assembling them into major storms. Beryl is the Atlantic’s first big project for 2024. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ocean surface temperatures are the foundation for hurricanes. The water needs to be around <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/tropical_stuff/hurricane_anatomy/hurricane_anatomy.html">80 degrees Fahrenheit</a> or warmer. Typically, the amount of hot water needed to power a major hurricane doesn’t accumulate until later in the summer, but the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/2/28/24085691/atlantic-ocean-warming-climate-change-hurricanes-coral-reefs-bleaching">Atlantic Ocean absorbed</a> a tremendous amount of heat in the past year as the planet heated up to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23969523/climate-change-cop28-paris-1-5-c-uae-2023-record-warm">hottest average temperature on record</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other major component of hurricanes is the air above the water. Hurricanes thrive when there is minimal wind shear, a phenomenon where winds push in different directions as the altitude changes. They also count on less stability in the layers of temperature and moisture in the atmosphere. “Weak stability (not much density change with altitude) allows easier transport of moist air near the surface to rise in the atmosphere where it can form cumulus clouds that produce heavy rain,” said <a href="https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/scientist/dr-michael-james-mcphaden">Michael McPhaden</a>, a hurricane researcher at NOAA, in an email.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, the shift from <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific">El Niño to La Niña</a> in the Pacific Ocean is driving more of these hurricane-favorable atmospheric conditions over the Atlantic. That’s why forecasters have been warning since May that this summer will bring an <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season">above-normal hurricane season</a>, with upward of seven major hurricanes at Category 3 or above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beryl also stands out because of how quickly it <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/01/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intensification-warning-sign">gathered strength</a>. Meteorologists describe this trait as <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/9/28/23376761/hurricane-ian-rapid-intensification-climate-change">rapid intensification</a>, where a hurricane’s wind speeds rise by at least 35 miles per hour in 24 hours. Beryl picked up 65 mph between Saturday and Sunday, though still nowhere near as quick as <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23932000/hurricane-otis-mexico-acapulco-rapid-intensification-extreme-climate">Hurricane Otis</a>, which spun up almost 100 mph in 12 hours last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the while, the climate is changing and <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/">worsening some of the most destructive elements</a> of hurricanes. Warmer temperatures are lifting sea levels, so when tropical storms make landfall, they push more water inland. Warmer air also holds onto more moisture, so storms dish out more rain. Hotter water also tends to lead to more rapid intensification.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More people are living in areas vulnerable to cyclones, too, so as these storms spool up, more lives and property are at stake. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, the people living in some of the most vulnerable areas are taking steps to prepare for future hurricanes. In particular, Caribbean countries have been investing in <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23886118/climate-change-disaster-warning-hurricane-maria-dominica-caribbean">disaster early warning systems</a> that can identify brewing storms and alert residents to evacuate or seek shelter. The Caribbean warning system received <a href="https://wmo.int/media/news/new-funding-approved-strengthen-multi-hazard-early-warning-systems-caribbean">$7 million in funding</a> from the United Nations in May to upgrade disaster alerts and responses across countries in the region. It’s part of a broader $3.1 billion UN push to ensure that all people on Earth are protected by a <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/early-warnings-for-all">disaster early warning system by the end of 2027</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But warnings are only the first step. The people receiving the warnings need to be able to act on them. On small, resource-poor islands, the routes to safety are few and fragile. And the threat from Beryl may not end when the storm passes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Getting relief supplies into afflicted countries is likely to remain a challenge, and the damage from Beryl could leave the Caribbean <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous">more vulnerable to the next hurricane</a> that erupts.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s six Republicans handed down a decision on Monday that gives Donald Trump such sweeping immunity from prosecution that there are unlikely to be any legal checks on his behavior if he returns to the White House. The Court’s three Democrats dissented.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> is an astonishing opinion. It holds that presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution — essentially, a license to commit crimes — so long as they use the official powers of their office to do so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Broadly speaking, Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion reaches three conclusions. The first is that when the president takes any action under the authority given to him by the Constitution itself, his authority is “conclusive and preclusive” and thus he cannot be prosecuted. Thus, for example, a president could not be prosecuted for pardoning someone, because the Constitution explicitly gives the chief executive the “Power to Grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One question that has loomed over this case for months is whether presidential immunity is so broad that the president could order the military to assassinate a political rival. While this case was before a lower court, one judge asked if Trump could be prosecuted if he’d <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/01/09/trump-immunity-appeals-court-arguments/">ordered “SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival”</a> and Trump’s lawyer answered that he could not unless Trump had previously been successfully impeached and convicted for doing so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roberts’s opinion in <em>Trump</em>, however, seems to go even further than Trump’s lawyer did. The Constitution, after all, states that the president “shall be commander in chief of the Army and Navy of the United States.” So, if presidential authority is “conclusive and preclusive” when presidents exercise their constitutionally granted powers, the Court appears to have ruled that yes, Trump could order the military to assassinate one of his political opponents. And nothing can be done to him for it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">writes in dissent</a>, “from this day forward, Presidents of tomorrow will be free to exercise the Commander-in-Chief powers, the foreign-affairs powers, and all the vast law enforcement powers enshrined in Article II however they please — including in ways that Congress has deemed criminal and that have potentially grave consequences for the rights and liberties of Americans.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roberts’s second conclusion is that presidents also enjoy “at least a presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for a President’s acts within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility.” Thus, if a president’s action even touches on his official authority (the “outer perimeter” of that authority), then the president enjoys a strong presumption of immunity from prosecution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This second form of immunity applies when the president uses authority that is not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, and it is quite broad — most likely extending even to mere conversations between the president and one of his subordinates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court also says that this second form of immunity is exceptionally strong. As Roberts writes, “the President must therefore be immune from prosecution for an official act unless the Government can show that applying a criminal prohibition to that act would pose <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">no ‘dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch.’</a>”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of Roberts’s opinion, moreover, details just how broad this immunity will be in practice. Roberts claims, for example, that Trump is immune from prosecution for conversations between himself and high-ranking Justice Department officials, where he allegedly urged them to pressure states to “replace their legitimate electors” with fraudulent members of the Electoral College who would vote to install Trump for a second term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roberts writes that “the Executive Branch has ‘exclusive authority and absolute discretion’ to decide which crimes to investigate and prosecute,” and thus Trump’s conversations with Justice Department officials fall within his “conclusive and preclusive authority.” Following that logic, Trump could not have been charged with a crime if he had ordered the Justice Department to arrest every Democrat who holds elective office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elsewhere in his opinion, moreover, Roberts suggests that any conversation between Trump and one of his advisers or subordinates could not be the basis for a prosecution. In explaining why Trump’s attempts to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to “fraudulently alter the election results” likely cannot be prosecuted, for example, Roberts points to the fact that the vice president frequently serves “as one of the President’s closest advisers.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, Roberts does concede that the president may be prosecuted for “unofficial” acts. So, for example, if Trump had personally attempted to shoot and kill then-presidential candidate Joe Biden in the lead-up to the 2020 election, rather than ordering a subordinate to do so, then Trump could probably be prosecuted for murder.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even this caveat to Roberts’s sweeping immunity decision is not very strong. Roberts writes that “in dividing official from unofficial conduct, courts may not inquire into the President’s motives.” And Roberts even limits the ability of prosecutors to pursue a president who accepts a bribe in return for committing an official act, such as pardoning a criminal who pays off the president. In Roberts’s words, a prosecutor may not “admit testimony or private records of the President or his advisers probing the official act itself.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means that, while the president can be prosecuted for an “unofficial” act, the prosecutors may not prove that he committed this crime using evidence drawn from the president’s “official” actions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The practical implications of this ruling are astounding. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor writes in a dissenting opinion, “imagine a President states in an official speech that he intends to stop a political rival from passing legislation that he opposes, no matter what it takes to do so,” it follows from Roberts’s opinion that the ensuing murder indictment “could include no allegation of the President’s public admission of premeditated intent to support” the proposition that the president intended to commit murder.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Monday’s decision, in other words, ensures that, should Trump return to power, he will do so with hardly any legal checks. Under the Republican justices’ decision in <em>Trump</em>, a future president can almost certainly order the assassination of his rivals. He can wield the authority of the presidency to commit countless crimes. And he can order a subordinate to do virtually anything.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And nothing can be done to him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In early December 2013, in the low-lying mountains of Guinea in West Africa, a 2-year-old named <a href="https://www.cdcmuseum.org/exhibits/show/ebola/westafrica/ebolaearlydays">Emile Ouamouno</a> had a sudden onset of strange symptoms: high fever, bloody stool, and vomiting. On December 6, the boy died in his home village of Meliandou. Emile’s 4-year-old sister, mother, and grandmother died shortly after, each suffering similar symptoms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March, scientists identified the cause of the deaths: the Ebola virus. By then, <a href="https://www.cdcmuseum.org/exhibits/show/ebola/westafrica/ebolaearlydays">82</a> more people had died. By <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/guinea/ebola-virus-disease-evd-west-africa-situation-27-may-2014">May</a>, the outbreak had spread to neighboring <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2014_03_30_ebola_lbr-en">Liberia</a> and Sierra Leone as the death toll neared 200.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These were the early months of what would become the <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/ebola-outbreak-2014-2016-West-Africa#:~:text=2016%20%2D%20West%20Africa-,Overview,outbreak%20than%20all%20others%20combined.">deadliest</a> Ebola outbreak in history. From 2014 to 2016, the outbreak overwhelmed health systems in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/ebola-outbreak-2014-2016-West-Africa#:~:text=2016%20%2D%20West%20Africa-,Overview,outbreak%20than%20all%20others%20combined.">Seven</a> other countries including Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States, also reported Ebola cases, primarily among health care workers and travelers who had recently been to West Africa.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In all, more than <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/ebola-outbreak-2014-2016-West-Africa#:~:text=2016%20%2D%20West%20Africa-,Overview,outbreak%20than%20all%20others%20combined.">11,000</a> people died.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The epidemic caught the world by surprise, exposing vast weaknesses in the world’s ability to contain and quell infectious diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Defense, and other diplomatic and development agencies responded immediately, mobilizing one of the largest outbreak response efforts in history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Ebola crisis played a role in kickstarting longer-term US government investment in global health security, a broad <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/health-security#tab=tab_1">term</a> that refers to activities needed to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, such as training health care personnel and building laboratories equipped to test for a wide range of pathogens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the CDC and other US government agencies were already involved in outbreak response activities globally before 2014, the Ebola crisis cemented a more permanent and sustained approach to building long-term global capacity to address infectious disease threats. In 2014, the CDC solidified its commitment to this by creating a new department: the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/healthprotection/about.html?_cid=dghp-lnd" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/healthprotection/about.html?_cid=dghp-lnd">Division of Global Health Protection</a>, which is solely dedicated to global health security. The US government, alongside more than 70 other countries, also launched the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/oga/global-health-security/agenda/index.html#:~:text=GHSA%20was%20initially%20launched%20in,for%20another%205%2Dyear%20phase.">Global Health Security Agenda</a>, which provided a blueprint for bolstering global health security around the world.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why I reported this</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Before becoming a fellow at Vox, I worked as an infectious diseases epidemiologist and global health security adviser in Africa. I observed many inefficiencies in the US government’s program. I thought we were squandering millions of taxpayer dollars and an opportunity to make the world safer from infectious diseases. I set out to interview others with long careers working in various facets of global health security to understand the root cause of these issues and to learn how we can do better in the future.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Have questions or thoughts? </strong>Email me at <a href="mailto:jessica.craig@vox.com">jessica.craig@vox.com</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past 10 years, the US government has doled out at least <a href="https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/breaking-down-the-u-s-global-health-budget-by-program-area/#GlobalHealthSecurity">$8 billion</a> to the CDC, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense for their global health security programs. (This figure excludes additional emergency funds provided for Zika and Ebola outbreak responses, the Covid-19 pandemic, and support for other infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.) The theory was that an infectious disease anywhere was a threat everywhere, so every country’s global health security capacity needed to improve.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Ebola crisis, and earlier pandemics such as swine flu in 2009, was a harbinger of crises to come: <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus">Zika</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">Covid-19</a>, <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/situations/monkeypox-oubreak-2022">monkeypox</a>, a resurgence in <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON518">dengue</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2023/s0323-TB-increase.html">tuberculosis</a>, and other diseases. Despite the influx of funding, we have seen that the world remains unprepared for infectious disease threats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From 2017 to 2018, I was a contractor at the CDC’s Division of Global Health Protection, and last year, I briefly served as a global health security technical advisor at USAID. Although there have been some strides in the right direction, by and large, the US hasn’t meaningfully reached many of its goals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Arguably, global health security has faltered because of a lack of solidarity. The US government has approached health security with too much of a traditional national security approach, focusing more on keeping foreign threats out of the US than quelling all threats globally. As such, US government agencies continually fail to understand or address local needs or to develop true partnerships with foreign governments, instead dictating how “partners” in foreign countries should build health security capacity with little to no local buy-in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, the Biden administration launched a new <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Global-Health-Security-Strategy-2024-1.pdf">US Global Health Security Strategy</a>, which outlines the goals for global health security for the next five years. Though the strategy highlights the importance of cooperation, country ownership, and science-based approaches, it doesn’t clearly outline how agencies will achieve those guiding principles. While the continued commitment to global health security is necessary, if the US government does not address fundamental issues underlying its programming, infectious diseases and future epidemics will continue to claim millions of lives each year and cause <a href="https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-024-08993-y#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20total%20global%20economic,110%2C111%2C112%5D.">billions</a> in economic losses.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What does it take to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What if when Emile Ouamouno first showed up at a health clinic in his rural village in Guinea, the doctors there had already been trained to identify symptoms of an Ebola infection? What if they could have immediately put him into an isolation room away from his family and other patients? What if the nurses could have donned hazmat suits and gloves, collected a blood sample from Emile, then sent it down the hall for a laboratory technician to test for a range of potential viruses or bacteria causing his sickness? What if just hours after discovering Ebola virus in his blood, the laboratory technician could have reported this finding to government staff across the country, immediately triggering a response to contain the spread of Ebola to just one village?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To prevent infectious diseases and to rapidly identify early signs of an outbreak and contain its spread, countries need four things, according to <a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/heymann.david">David Heymann</a>, a professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (he also&nbsp;previously supported Ebola outbreak responses in Africa when he worked at the CDC):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Local-level health care systems that are adequately funded, staffed, and equipped to take care of their people.</strong> This means having doctor’s offices and clinics that are accessible to the population they serve and having enough doctors and nurses even in the most remote clinic. And it means having pharmacies consistently stocked with vaccines and medicines.</li>



<li><strong>A broader, well-functioning public health system that can facilitate important information and investigations with key players. </strong>This includes functioning laboratories, a system for collecting data on disease incidence, and a system for health care providers to quickly alert officials when they come across a patient with an infectious disease that could spark an outbreak. You need teams of epidemiologists and researchers to investigate outbreaks, monitor trends in cases and deaths, and conduct contact tracing. You need public health officials communicating with the general public and working with policymakers and politicians. You need existing policies and procedures that outline how to mobilize resources to areas with outbreaks.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Health and public health systems that care for animals, an important source of zoonotic infectious diseases that may spillover from animals to humans. </strong>And you need people in the human and animal health sector to collaborate, share information, and come up with a strategy that protects both humans and animals.</li>



<li><strong>Finally, it helps to have healthy populations,</strong> where risk factors for severe disease and death — such as obesity, diabetes, malnutrition, or HIV infection — are not very prevalent.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, most countries are lacking on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers from several NGOs and universities developed <a href="https://ghsindex.org/">The Global Health Security Index</a>, which comprehensively assesses country capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases. In their 2021 <a href="https://ghsindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021_GHSindexFullReport_Final.pdf">report</a>, they found that even after significant investment and effort during the Covid-19 pandemic, “all countries remain dangerously unprepared to meet future epidemic and pandemic threats.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of 195 countries included in their index, 126 did not have an overarching national public health emergency response plan, 128 have no plan for testing for novel pathogens during a public health emergency, and 169 countries did not have national health security plans that addressed the risk of zoonotic diseases. Beyond the index, health care systems in developing countries are woefully understaffed. Some <a href="https://www.afro.who.int/news/chronic-staff-shortfalls-stifle-africas-health-systems-who-study">47 countries</a> in Africa face severe shortages of health workers, and <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/18-09-2023-billions-left-behind-on-the-path-to-universal-health-coverage#:~:text=In%202021%2C%20about%204.5%20billion,covered%20by%20essential%20health%20services.">4.5 billion</a> people around the world do not have full access to health services.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a lot of complex moving parts within global health security. Sometimes the challenge seems insurmountable. While the CDC, in a statement to Vox, said that it recognizes global public health is a “team effort,” unfortunately the current paternalistic approach alienates its most important partners, according to the experts Vox spoke with.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Global health security requires solidarity that we don’t have</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the US government’s global health security funding does, in part, fulfill a humanitarian mission to improve the lives and livelihoods of people around the world, experts have accused the US government of pushing too much of a US-centric agenda that is primarily focused on keeping diseases out of the US rather than developing true partnerships and building capacity around the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are several examples of this. The US government invested heavily in developing at least <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10032372/">two</a> effective and FDA-approved treatments for Ebola; however, to date, these drugs remain largely siloed away in US stockpiles for national security and biodefense and have not been made readily available in foreign countries during Ebola outbreaks, according to <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/msf-calls-global-emergency-stockpile-ebola-treatments">Doctors Without Borders</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Heymann points to the Covid-19 pandemic as another example. While the US and European governments were criticized for not sharing the Covid-19 vaccine, the discourse among public health officials in Africa was vastly different. In 2021, Heymann asked public health leaders from Africa what the most important vaccine was to them. They said it was the malaria vaccine. They reported that they did not need the Covid-19 vaccine because the toll was lower compared to other diseases, perhaps because populations in Africa are generally younger and have fewer comorbidities. (A lack of testing likely also reduced the number of cases and deaths recorded.) In fact, the officials Heymann spoke with saw the vaccination push as “a measure of the North to protect itself by making us get vaccinated,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is widespread perception that global health security is an American program pushing an American agenda, or perhaps more broadly an effort devised for the benefit of the Global North. Local officials and organizations do not trust American and European global health security staff, according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/syra-madad-5b9495">Syra Madad</a>, the chief biopreparedness officer at <a href="https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/">NYC Health + Hospitals</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This perception is one reason why foreign governments do not prioritize global health security  and do not dedicate domestic funds to maintaining systems that the US and other donor countries invest in. More than <a href="https://ghsindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021_GHSindexFullReport_Final.pdf">150</a> countries included in the 2021 Global Health Security Index did not have domestic funding for epidemic threats. Competing health priorities and a general lack of domestic funds certainly play a role, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The reality is, you can invest money, you can invest resources, but there’s only so much you can do, unless the other country comes to the table and says, ‘You know what, we are going to not only use this funding and resources, but we’re going to now take this on, and it’s going to be our country issue. We’re going to invest in it, we’re going to maintain it.’ And that’s really what’s been the struggle,” Madad added.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What can we do differently in the next 10 years?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the US government may have little to show for its massive investment in global health security in the past 10 years, it could be laying an important foundation for future work. Developing the health and public health systems required to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious diseases is certainly a long game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The requirements around the world for making substantial progress are huge. The world is very big. It’s very susceptible to infectious disease,” <a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/tom-inglesby-md">Tom Inglesby</a>, the director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said. “So moving the needle on real preparedness is difficult.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First and foremost, the US government needs to forge true partnerships with foreign governments where ideas are exchanged back and forth and both parties jointly work toward building health security capacity. The US government should also require local buy-in and domestic investment from foreign governments; this would help ensure that the areas where the US is putting taxpayer dollars is a true priority in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have to decolonize ourselves,” Heymann explained. “It’s no longer, ‘we’ll give you the money, and you do it.’ It’s ‘you request the money from us, and then you put in your share, and we’ll put in our share,’” he said. “If countries aren’t engaged in wanting to do the job, then why should we be giving the money? That’s just forcing them to do something they don’t want to.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Madad also recommends that the US government open up more direct funding lines to the frontline clinics and community-based organizations that are knee-deep in responding to epidemics rather than funneling those funds through larger institutions such as the Ministry of Health or World Health Organization. She also recommends focusing on building capacity at the primary health care level, such as those rural clinics like the one Emile Ouamouno visited after he became infected with the Ebola virus.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A lot of it all starts with primary care,” Madad said. “If you have a good primary care infrastructure and you’re building that workforce around it, then you’re able to really detect cases of a novel or an emerging or reemerging infectious disease much sooner,” she said. “If we’re able to really invest in primary care around the world and provide the resources and the workforce to be able to provide this primary care, then we would be in much, much better shape.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Steven Phillips-Horst had a problem — er, “problem,” depending on who you ask — that plagues many a modern Spotify listener. No matter what song the podcaster and comedian played, whether by Taylor Swift or Celine Dion, Morgan Wallen or the band How to Dress Well, the platform would immediately queue up Sabrina Carpenter’s “Espresso” next.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How is it that no matter what direction my unique personality takes me in, it leads me back to this same song that I only heard three days ago that I don’t even really like that much?” he asks over the phone, not knowing that the same thing had been happening to me, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The disco-inflected soft pop hit, performed by a Polly Pocket-sized former Disney Channel star, was <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/5/14/24155699/sabrina-carpenter-espresso-career-olivia-rodrigo-explained">deemed the song of summer</a> nearly as soon as it was released in mid-April. But Phillips-Horst wondered, was that because the song was good? Or, as he <a href="https://twitter.com/gossipbabies/status/1790841532745953781">proposed on X</a>, was it because of the tantalizing (if unfounded) theory that Carpenter’s label was paying Spotify to force-feed “Espresso” down the throats of listeners the world over?</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No matter what song you listen to on Spotify, it will play Espresso as the next track. It’s not an “algorithm.” The label is paying for radio play in an old school, industry plant kinda way and it’s honestly refreshing.

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s not an ‘algorithm,’” he wrote. “The label is paying for radio play in an old school, industry plant kinda way and it’s honestly refreshing. We are so back etc!” Responses flooded in, with hundreds of others saying they too couldn’t escape “Espresso” or other hits from new-ish entries into the pop game, namely Chappell Roan’s “<a href="https://x.com/deliclit/status/1795831409116053814">Good Luck, Babe!</a>” and Tommy Richman’s “<a href="https://x.com/JasmynBeKnowing/status/1795479334561726950">Million Dollar Baby</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The theory seems to be an increasingly popular one: that the biggest music streaming platform in the world has arrangements with record labels to boost streams for particular songs and artists. It’s not exactly a far-fetched conclusion. The history of pop music is rife with payola scandals, in which <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/hit-men-fredric-dannen/1102301782">powerful executives</a> (and sometimes the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/08/archives/moblinked-conduits-get-subpoenas-in-payola-case-u-s-officials.html">literal mafia</a>) manufactured hits by paying for radio play, and, after the practice was first outlawed in 1960, finding loopholes to get around each new restriction. “When publicity is valuable, people will inevitably find ways to pay for it,” says <a href="https://soc.ucla.edu/person/gabriel-rossman/">Gabriel Rossman</a>, a sociologist at UCLA who studies bribery in the music industry. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no hard evidence to suggest that labels are directly paying Spotify to boost certain artists and songs, according to the music industry scholars and insiders I interviewed. Yet it’s almost impossible to prove that it’s <em>not</em> happening: Deals between record labels and streaming platforms are confidential and algorithms are intentionally designed as black boxes. (Spotify would not agree to an interview, but said in a statement that “The remarkable growth of fan bases for artists like Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, and Tommy Richman on Spotify is a testament to their hard work and artistry.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the most likely explanation is the most boring — that certain songs take off on music discovery algorithms because listeners seem to like them — the question of why users keep getting served Sabrina Carpenter is far more complex than that. No wonder so many of us think something shady is going on, even if we can’t quite put our fingers on what.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Spotify’s algorithm works</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Users tend to refer to a singular, all-powerful Spotify algorithm, but there is no single one that determines what songs are served to its 600 million listeners. Rather each of the platform’s features work differently and have specific (albeit similar) goals. “Smart Shuffle,” for example, queues new songs to a playlist you’ve already made, while the personalized “Discover Weekly” uses an algorithm meant to design a playlist of new songs that are similar to the music you’ve recently listened to. Newer features like <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/spotify-daylist-trend-how-to-find-search-music-rcna134708">daylists</a> and the AI-powered <a href="https://thetacomaledger.com/2024/02/19/my-affair-with-spotifys-ai-dj/">DJ X</a> are also based on users’ “taste profiles.” Search for a specific song and Spotify will typically autoplay music that’s sonically similar to the one you searched for, while <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/FAQs/Spotify-Radio-how-does-it-work/ta-p/4757060#:~:text=Spotify%20Radio%20is%20a%20feature,what%20mood%20you're%20in.">Spotify Radio</a> creates personalized playlists out of any song, album, or artist you choose. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/C52KrcSR5jW/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"><div> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C52KrcSR5jW/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C52KrcSR5jW/?utm_source=ig_embed&#038;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank">A post shared by Sabrina Carpenter (@sabrinacarpenter)</a></p></div></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of these features are the subject of mistrust and theorizing among the listening public. The website <a href="https://www.popfiltr.com/articles/all-top-50-artists-on-spotify-have-sabrina-carpenters-please-please-please-at-number-2-on-their-artist-or-song-radios">PopFiltr found</a> that Carpenter’s new single “Please Please Please” took the No. 2 spot on dozens of artists’ Radio playlists. This would make sense for modern pop acts like Harry Styles or Lana Del Rey but less so for, say, Frank Sinatra, Creedence Clearwater Revival, or one playlist based on the artist “Fart Fest,” which publishes literal fart noises. (I wasn’t able to recreate these findings, as they’re algorithmically tailored to each user, but “Please Please Please” was second in Radio playlists for Clairo, Boygenius, Charli XCX, and Dua Lipa, and was almost always followed by a Chappell Roan song and “Espresso.”) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You’d think all this means that somewhere in the depths of Spotify’s servers, there’s a giant lever that pushes Carpenter’s music out to millions of people at once. But, as Glenn McDonald, the former “data alchemist” at Spotify and founder of the music microgenre catalog <a href="https://everynoise.com/">Every Noise at Once</a>, explains, “None of it is as centralized as you’re imagining — it’s not like there’s a master sticker on the song that causes everybody to promote it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McDonald, who understands how Spotify works better than perhaps anyone, says that the question shouldn’t be about payola or some other seedy arrangement between Spotify and music labels, but about algorithms: “A lot of things on Spotify are trying to keep you in your comfort zone and play you the right things.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://noahaskin.com/about/">Noah Askin</a>, a computational social scientist who studies the music industry, says that algorithms like Spotify’s typically use collaborative filtering, a concept used by recommendation engines to predict what users want to be served next. The gist is that if User A and User B have overlapping tastes, User A will probably enjoy the other music that User B is listening to.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-left"><blockquote><p>“It’s not like there’s a master sticker on the song that causes everybody to promote it.”<br><br> —Glenn McDonald</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He also points to the Matthew Effect, or the idea that the already successful will have an easier time becoming more successful. Music recommendation algorithms can make big songs <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/research-into-the-impact-of-streaming-services-algorithms-on-music-consumption/the-impact-of-algorithmically-driven-recommendation-systems-on-music-consumption-and-production-a-literature-review">even bigger at the expense of others</a>. “Once you have a bunch of attention, it’s much easier to get more attention,” Askin says. “When a Beyoncé song comes out, it’s more likely to get played because she’s already more popular … and so the people who don’t listen to her but are into pop music, guess who they’re going to get fed?” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He compares this to the Google and Netflix algorithms, which take an impossibly large slew of content and present it to users in a way that will make them spend as much time as possible on their platforms. The platforms do this by pushing out what’s already proven catchy with people with similar tastes. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neither Roan nor Carpenter is anywhere near as famous as Beyoncé, but Askin suspects part of the reason they keep showing up on pop fans’ Spotify algorithms is due to a sociological concept called “optimal distinctiveness” that explains many listeners’ tastes. “What we found was that the songs that are pretty similar to what&#8217;s popular but a little bit distinctive are the ones that do best,” he says. “If it all just sounds the same, it gets boring. On the other end of the spectrum, anything that’s too weird, it’s like &#8230; I’m not interested in really pushing my listening horizons that much.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1368430209102841">2009 study</a> on optimal distinctiveness found that young people preferred and identified more with music styles at “intermediate” popularity levels, as opposed to either massively popular or esoteric ones. Spotify’s algorithms likely reflect and strengthen that bias, to its own benefit. “What Spotify cares about [is that] you continue to listen on their platform, that you stay on their platform for as long as possible. And what’s going to do that is providing people with songs that sound like what they like but have some degree of novelty to them,” says Askin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McDonald’s assessment of the Spotify algorithm echoes Askin’s: “Especially if [the artist] is slightly less popular and a bit more attuned to what you usually like, then that makes them a better match than someone who’s very popular and crosses genre or audience boundaries.” A Taylor Swift listener, then, would be more likely to get fed “Espresso” or “Good Luck, Babe!” than a Carpenter or Roan listener would get served Swift. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also less tangible reasons why certain songs appear to be overnight successes when they’re anything but. “Espresso” may sound like a lot of disco-inspired pop these days, but Carpenter’s opening stint on Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour, her buzzy romance with <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24085155/irish-cillian-murphy-paul-mescal-andrew-scott-barry-keoghan">actor Barry Keoghan</a>, and a fun persona as “a proudly flippant ditz who is so much savvier than she seems,” as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2024/5/14/24155699/sabrina-carpenter-espresso-career-olivia-rodrigo-explained">my colleague described it</a>, all undoubtedly played a part in making the song the sensation it became.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chappell Roan, meanwhile, has been publicly trying to “make it” in music for years; she was dropped by her label after her 2020 single flopped — a single that just entered the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/">Billboard Hot 100</a> for the first time. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fans-are-hot-to-go-for-chappell-roan-photos-videos-show-crowds-clamoring-for-pops-rising-star-214817320.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJJOZUmzoopBsGHUdRsQbOKP4pWjVdewFP2ooo7vr9fi9ZndwmetklJR-Vo1NwZNF785s-lAC7zylDz8IfIQw6C3GtJPOq3t4DnIt5vd_Wam4vP-SYeMCevmjxjSp5qFaCZ96dYtduZ4SF4DDak-kZssMRf1GWHUav1ZN1AAReic">After scoring a spot</a> on Olivia Rodrigo’s tour earlier this year and an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4WiXKGCJhg">NPR Tiny Desk concert</a>, more fans were exposed to her high-energy, drag-inspired stage performances, drawing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/17/entertainment/chappell-roan-bonnaroo-2024/index.html">enormous crowds</a> at music festivals this spring. Despite the accusations Roan and Carpenter have <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24114819/industry-plants-music-pop-rap-internet-hottest-conspiracy">faced of being “industry plants”</a> (allegations often marred in sexism), there are clearly other explanations for their recent success beyond literally paying Spotify for it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Even if it’s “payola,” it’s not payola</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If record labels were paying Spotify for streams, it still wouldn’t technically be payola. US laws against payola, or the practice of paying a radio station to play a specific song without disclosing the payment, only apply to public airwaves. Because there is a finite amount of bandwidth for radio, they have to be managed in the public interest, Rossman explains. “The [Federal Communications Commission] gets to tell broadcasters as a condition of their license that they have to follow certain rules.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The internet, on the other hand, is capable of disseminating virtually limitless data, and therefore the payola laws don’t apply. In theory, anyone can build a Spotify competitor and queue up whatever songs they desire (fun dinner party question: you’re the CEO of Spotify, what’s your “Espresso”?). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spotify actually <em>does</em> offer a version of pay-for-play that’s theoretically available to any artist who opts in. In 2020, it debuted a feature that allowed recording artists to forfeit 30 percent of streaming profits in order to increase the likelihood that a song will be played during a listening session. The program, called <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/discovery-mode">Discovery Mode</a>, was immediately likened to payola <a href="https://www.recordingacademy.com/advocacy/news/does-spotifys-new-discovery-mode-resemble-anti-creator-payola">by the Recording Academy</a> when it launched.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While music managers said they loved the program — <a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/spotify-discovery-mode-congress-managers/">some said it</a> increased a song’s streams by 200 to 300 percent — three members of Congress slammed Discovery Mode for penalizing up-and-coming artists in an effort to beef up Spotify&#8217;s bottom line, according to a letter <a href="https://variety.com/2022/music/news/congress-spotify-troubling-discovery-mode-policy-1235226722/">obtained by Variety</a>. The program “may set in motion a ‘race to the bottom’ in which artists and labels feel compelled to accept lower royalties as a necessary way to break through an extremely crowded and competitive music environment,” they wrote to Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The artists using Discovery Mode are likely not the Sabrina Carpenters of the world. In its <a href="https://artists.spotify.com/en/discovery-mode">marketing materials</a>, Spotify highlights the success stories of a handful of smaller acts signed to independent record labels who have used the service. But because of the stigma associated with pay-for-play, it’s understandable that few would be transparent about it. It’s impossible to say for sure how many or which artists use Discovery Mode, however, because Spotify doesn’t label its songs as such.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-text-align-right"><blockquote><p>“Usually, these songs will have an entire team behind it that’s literally social engineering the whole thing.” <br>—George Goodrich</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Major label artists may not need to use Discovery Mode in part because two of the three biggest labels in the world, Universal and Sony, own between 6 and 7 percent of Spotify stock, according to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/who-really-owns-spotify-955388/">one 2020 estimate</a>. “Spotify is reliant on the major labels in particular for access to the catalogs of music that are driving its growth. It needs to play to their tune,” one music business scholar <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/music-features/espresso-sabrina-carpenter-spotify-streaming-3757741">told NME</a>. The major labels “have these tier one relationships with people that work at Spotify … and opportunities can come from that.” explains George Goodrich, founder and CEO of <a href="https://playlistpush.com/?">Playlist Push</a>, an agency that allows artists to pay for consideration on top Spotify playlists and in influencers’ TikTok videos. “It’s all just about connections.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, “playlisting” has been another important strategy for marketers since the 2010s. Artists and their teams enlist agencies to submit songs to independent playlist curators ($285 for consideration in 48 playlists, $3,000 for <a href="https://playlistpush.com/pricing">500</a>), who can either choose to include them or not; services like Playlist Push are clear in noting that paying for editorial consideration is no guarantee that a song will end up in a popular playlist. Playlist Push says they have worked with more than 25,000 artists, labels, and managers since 2017. A prime spot in a big playlist can launch an artist’s career: One <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/09/spotify-rapcaviar-most-influential-playlist-in-music.html">record exec compared</a> the Spotify editorial playlist RapCaviar to “Hot 97 in the early ’90s,” helping to blow up songs like Cardi B’s 2017 breakout “Bodak Yellow” and Lil Uzi Vert’s “XO TOUR Llif3.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One illicit way music marketers have paid for artificial boosts: stream farming. In 2021, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/digital-marketing-streaming-manipulation-1138529/">Rolling Stone investigated</a> the pay-for-play “black market” where third-party companies promise to net hundreds of millions of streams per month, typically via bot accounts, for a certain network of artists. “There are a few third-party companies out there running this for a lot of the major companies,” one anonymous record label employee told the magazine. “We use them too for some of our artists.” It’s risky business, though. Spotify penalizes artists whose songs have been found to be targets of artificial streams, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/spotify-artists-streaming-fraud-1235965379/">even in cases where</a> the artist or label wasn’t involved in the scheme. “It’s really terrible for your data profile on Spotify,” says Goodrich. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without resorting to stream-farming or some other hidden algorithmic boost, music marketers have gotten far savvier at predicting what will hit with listeners. What seems like sudden ubiquity for a song or artist is often extremely canny strategizing by well-connected industry insiders who are adept at responding to online chatter and listening habits. “People will tease songs for weeks, if not months, where the audio is already on short-form platforms but not commercially available on streaming services yet. People also test singles that way to see if their feelings on songs are right,” says Jenny Kaufman, the head of global streaming promotion at Crush Music. Post Malone and Morgan Wallen <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/morgan-wallen-post-malone-song-i-had-some-help-1234934967/">teased their song</a> “I Had Some Help” on social media for months before it was released in May; it was recently the No. 1 song on the Billboard charts (though now second to “Please Please Please.”) “We’re seeing more and more artists drop full albums, we’re seeing more and more artists do less lead-in singles. That in part is due to the interest in seeing which songs fans will react to.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On TikTok, which wields <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1m-KgEpoow">enormous influence</a> on the music industry, labels will often partner with talent agencies to pay influencers to use their music in videos. Goodrich points to the success of “Million Dollar Baby,” which Richman <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/a/eric-skelton/tommy-richman-million-dollar-baby-hit">teased on TikTok</a> in April and which blew up on the platform immediately. He guesses it capitalized on the savviness and connections of manager Ty Baisden, and artist and agency founder Brent Faiyaz. “Usually, these songs will have an entire team behind it that’s literally social engineering the whole thing,” says Goodrich. “They have extremely creative people who are thinking about how they can make the song take off, and they’re usually pretty good at it. And they’ve figured out some type of formula that no one else has.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why people are inclined to believe a Spotify conspiracy theory&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Considering all the unseen, mysterious ways that algorithms function and music marketers do their work, it’s almost easier to think that everything we’re hearing on streaming platforms amounts to straightforward payola. Perhaps it’s not a coincidence that Phillips-Horst’s tweet expresses a bit of ironic nostalgia for the days when payola was a reasonable explanation for a song’s popularity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">True, other kinds of pay-for-play transactions could very well be happening — again, those contracts are confidential, and none of the record labels I reached out to responded to my request for comment — but it wouldn’t fall under the FCC’s payola law. Though experts on algorithms disagree, Rossman says he could still envision labels paying the platform to promote certain songs. “It seems plausible,” Rossman says. “And I would expect it to happen.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tommyrichman/video/7357455205916757294" data-video-id="7357455205916757294" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@tommyrichman" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tommyrichman?refer=embed">@tommyrichman</a> <p>Million dollar baby </p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ Million dollar baby - Tommy Richman" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Million-dollar-baby-7357455282735909675?refer=embed">♬ Million dollar baby &#8211; Tommy Richman</a> </section> </blockquote> 
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rossman suggests that such agreements should fall under the Federal Trade Commission’s laws that require influencers to disclose advertisements. If Spotify “wanted to be safe, all they’d have to do is include something in the metatext saying, ‘This artist opted into the Discovery Mode program,’” he says. “Or, ‘You got this certain song because it has these attributes and we provide this weight to those attributes.’ They’re doing that internally somewhere on the Spotify servers, they’re just not sending it to the user.” (An FTC spokesperson told me it does not comment on specific companies unless it has publicly announced an action against them.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The only reason we’re having this conversation at all is because Spotify and other streaming platforms intentionally obscure how they work. “As a listener, I wish I could tell on any given song, ‘Why is this here? Why should I trust you?’” says McDonald. But crucially, he says, “To me, this is not a Spotify-specific problem, not a music-specific problem. It’s everything about how technology mediates human interaction, if it goes through these black boxes of machine learning or AI. You’re just left [asking] ‘Here&#8217;s the answer, how do I trust it?’ … I think that&#8217;s a bad state, that we as people who work on technology have to improve.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, Spotify <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/04/tech/spotify-layoffs-third-round/index.html">laid off</a> around 2,200 workers, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/12/every-noise-shut-down-spotify-layoffs/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJRvvHvdZxbpve1UomQXrJfI77lWQyaOFDoItfV5qafCBO_ej37OFBFSJX6mRZgULl03c-kFYmJw11_MZmMzCx1ddoeYeKbDmC1udHhC-_AGi4I0W4sG-iqv1Pc55_aTadELys_Mjb3dmNL3NtOFyekUHo74M2oSFg_m2aulx1_k">including McDonald</a>. Its efforts of late have centered around launching new AI features, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24124070/spotify-ai-playlist-music-beta-launch-premium-uk-australia">one</a> in which users can prompt an AI tool to create a playlist based on a few words. Pricing for the service <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/spotify-price-hike-premium-plans-2024-1235913620/">rose again this June,</a> with individual plans going up $1 per month, up to $11.99. The result will no doubt be more anxiety and confusion among its listeners, who will continue to wonder why its algorithms have so much power over the soundtrack to their lives, or whether it’s even an algorithm at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People should demand transparency and control over their own experience,” McDonald adds. “Algorithms are tools, but many times these tools are only operated by the people who run the streaming platform, the search engine, or the shopping site. To the extent that those tools can be given to you, the person, to empower yourself and to amplify your curiosity &#8230; that’s more interesting to me than things that just ask you, ‘Hold still, and we’ll discover something for you.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, the summer of Spotify conspiracy theories rages on, while the internet debates which artists are industry plants and which labels are doing payola, even if — and in fact, because — we can’t quite grasp who or how. “And the grammy for the best autoplay song of the year goes to,” wrote <a href="https://x.com/_dakshin_43/status/1802553045886419262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1802553045886419262%7Ctwgr%5E39c5986fcc6debc385d74f120f299d508548ffa1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthetab.com%2Fuk%2F2024%2F06%2F17%2Fdoes-sabrina-carpenter-always-autoplay-after-any-song-on-spotify-an-investigation-370252">one person on X</a>, “our payola queen Sabrina Carpenter.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a fractious coalition that at times seems to be held together with spit, baling wire, and old memories of Barack Obama, the Democratic Party has a remarkably singular message: Donald Trump is an existential threat to the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the Biden campaign, the existential threat to democracy has become the overriding theme in his bid for reelection. “There is one existential threat: It’s Donald Trump,” Biden <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/03/04/one-existential-threat-in-shift-biden-gives-trump-a-tongue-lashing/">said</a> at a fundraiser in February.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the environmental activists in the party, climate change is the existential concern, and a Trump victory would be devastating for the planet, as Biden himself <a href="https://norfolkdailynews.com/news/a-halting-biden-sparks-democratic-anxiety-about-his-candidacy/article_fa12172e-355a-11ef-8d78-979198cd5876.html">argued</a> at Thursday’s debate: “The only existential threat to humanity is climate change, and [Trump] didn’t do a damn thing about it.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reproductive rights, too, are cast in existential terms. “Trump poses an existential threat to abortion rights in Pennsylvania,” Democratic US Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/democrats-reproductive-rights-biden-campaign-bucks-county/">said</a> at a press conference in April. “If given the chance, he will ban abortion across the country with or without Congress.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Existential math</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As it happens, I know a little bit about existential threats, having <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/bryan-walsh/end-times/9780316449601/?lens=hachette-books">written a book in 2019</a> on the subject. <a href="https://www.existentialriskobservatory.org/risks/">It refers to those threats</a> that could conceivably risk the extinction or widespread destruction of humanity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The real way to tell the difference between an existential threat and a more ordinary one is not what people warning say, it’s what they do. Existential threats demand existential responses. After all, if you conceivably felt the country and perhaps even the world were truly at risk, you’d presumably do everything you could to prevent that catastrophe. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to the Democrats and the left — from the Biden campaign on down to the activists — it is impossible to look at what they’re doing and conclude that they truly believe Donald Trump is an existential threat. And that may pose an existential challenge to the party.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Winning is the only thing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden entered Thursday night’s debate clearly losing, and it’s safe to say that afterward, very few people — outside perhaps Biden’s inner circle — think the president is positioned to win this election. The debate spotlighted the one issue that voters have repeatedly told pollsters is a serious problem, the one issue Biden can do almost nothing to change: his age. And rather than seizing a rare opportunity to disprove those fears, Biden’s halting, often disoriented performance did the opposite. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cue the Democratic panic and an entire New York Times editorial board worth of columnists urging Biden to step aside. The campaign instantly said, as it has said every time these calls have been made, that the president would do no such thing, and at this point there’s little reason not to believe them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of this is risk aversion: A president has never called off a reelection bid this late in the campaign, and no one really knows what would come next. Some of it is presumably pride. Biden is a proud man who was on his third try for the presidency when he finally won in 2020. Giving up is not really in his DNA. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of it is political calculation. If the president steps aside, the logical candidate is Vice-President Kamala Harris, but Harris has struggled in office and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/12/kamala-harris-favorability-poll-00162093">her poor poll ratings</a> mirror those of Biden. If the Democratic Party tries to sideline Harris and open the door to other candidates through an open convention, they risk alienating her and her supporters and opening up further wounds in the Democratic coalition. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bad choices, all. But the nature of an existential threat is that everything else — feelings, ambition, everything — is put aside. Yet even as the chance of a second Trump presidency rises by the day, the Democratic political establishment does nothing. That’s not how you act in the face of an existential threat.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/gettyimages-2158937115.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="US President Joe Biden during the first presidential debate with former US President Donald Trump, not pictured, in Atlanta, Georgia, US, on Thursday, June 27, 2024. | Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Existential until it isn’t</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just politicians, though. The winners of presidential elections pick Supreme Court justices, and it was obvious that a then-83-year-old Ruth Bader Ginsburg might not make it through the next presidential term after the 2016 election, potentially imperiling abortion rights, among other Democratic priorities. Yet Ginsburg — buoyed by a number of Democratic supporters who viewed calls for her retirement as sexist — refused to step down. We all know what happened later. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One would think that sitting Democratic justices would have learned from Ginsburg’s example and acted differently in the face of a new supposedly existential threat from Trump. Yet Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — who are 70 and 64, respectively — have so far refused to heed <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/354381/supreme-court-sotomayor-kagan-retire-now">increasingly desperate calls</a> from writers like my colleague Ian Milhiser to step down and lock in their seats for decades. Each has perfectly good reasons to stay on, as did Ginsburg; none of those reasons make sense in the face of a true existential threat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nowhere is the gap between existential rhetoric and existential action greater than in climate change, which has emerged in recent years as one of the top priorities for Democrats. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can’t find a climate activist — and, increasingly, a Democratic politician — who doesn’t frame climate change as an existential issue. With reason — the worst-case climate scenarios really do <a href="https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/otm/segments/why-its-so-important-study-climate-worst-case-on-the-media">represent something like an existential threat</a> to the future of not just the US, but the entire world. And given Trump’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/26/climate/climate-policies-trump-would-reverse.html">determined opposition to actual climate policy</a>, it’s fair to view his potential return to the White House as a part of that threat. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet there <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerpielke/2019/09/19/the-yawning-gap-between-climate-rhetoric-and-climate-action/">is a clear and yawning gap</a> between climate rhetoric and climate action. On the Democratic political side, that’s perhaps understandable; climate change is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/08/09/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-climate-change/">not a top priority</a> for most voters, and politicians have to grapple with that fact. (You can’t save the Earth if you don’t have the votes.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Too often, though, climate activists and groups <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/04/06/environmentalists-climate-clean-energy-regulation/">end up opposing</a> many of the new energy projects that are needed to actually decarbonize energy, from transmission lines to solar projects to wind power, often tying them up in years of litigation. The Sunrise Movement, one of the most radical climate activist groups out there, has <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/04/scoop-group-that-aided-climate-plan-wont-back-biden?utm_campaign=editorial&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">bafflingly withheld its endorsemen</a>t from Biden so far, even though he prioritized passage of the most ambitious climate bill in US history. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The groups have reasons for what they’re doing — there are always reasons — but if climate change were treated as the existential threat the loudest activists say it is, those reasons wouldn’t matter.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do you believe what you say?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Treating an existential threat as existential requires the one thing that the Democratic coalition has increasingly struggled to do: prioritization. It means putting aside personal feelings, individual ambition, and subjective preferences in favor of a single goal: success. Otherwise, it’s just empty rhetoric.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As New York Times<em> </em>columnist Ezra Klein, who has been pushing the possibility of an open convention to replace Biden, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-presidential-debate.html">said on his podcast after Thursday’s debate</a>: “If the fate of American democracy is hinging on this election — as Democrats are always telling me it is and as I think there is a chance that it is — then you should do everything you can to win it.” That a strategy, any strategy, might make people or groups uncomfortable cannot be a reason not to pursue it in the face of an existential threat. Not if you believe what you’re saying.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is “maternal mortality”?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The dry, clinical term obscures a devastating loss: A person dies as a result of bringing a child into the world. That child loses a parent; a household is plunged into grief; a family that should be celebrating is left to mourn. Pretty much everyone can agree that such deaths are tragic and that even one is too many. What experts don’t agree on is how to count them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, researchers have been warning the public that maternal deaths in America were rising, more than doubling between the 2000s and 2010s, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That spike, shocking for one of the wealthiest countries in the world, drew concern from health professionals and policymakers alike, with <a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/community/adults/women/task_force_maternal_mortality/">many</a> <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.0463">states</a> and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/08/08/maternal-mortality-biden/">federal government</a> establishing task forces to make birth safer. Last year, for example, the Department of Health and Human Services <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/about/news/press-releases/hrsa-address-maternal-health-crisis">announced $90 million in awards</a> to fight maternal mortality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/3/16/24102224/maternal-mortality-rate-study-united-states">some scholars</a> are arguing that the CDC’s methods have become too broad in recent years and capture deaths that aren’t related to pregnancy. Others, meanwhile, say the CDC numbers remain the best way to capture a complicated picture, in which underlying conditions can combine with poor prenatal and postpartum care to cause preventable illness and death. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This debate is about more than just numbers. It has thrown into question two decades of policies and practices around childbirth and its risks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is the maternal mortality crisis referenced repeatedly in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/16/opinion/reduce-maternal-mortality-strategies.html">American</a> media <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-maternal-mortality-hits-highest-level-since-1965-f9829776">outlets</a> (including <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24092448/black-mothers-maternal-mortality-crisis-solutions">Vox</a>) overblown? And if so, are the initiatives meant to fix the problem — and the many other efforts experts and advocacy groups have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/16/opinion/reduce-maternal-mortality-strategies.html">long recommended</a> — still necessary? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Answering these questions will determine how we think and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/no-more-women-arent-dying-in-childbirth/678486/">talk about pregnancy and childbirth</a>, and how the US cares for people at an incredibly vulnerable time in their lives.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What the CDC says about maternal deaths</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maternal deaths in the US are counted in a few different ways, including analysis by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-mortality/php/mmrc/index.html">state and local committees</a>. But the topline national numbers that get the most attention come from the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. According to the agency, maternal mortality is a serious problem in America, one that’s only grown over the past two decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, the most recent year for which data are available, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2022/maternal-mortality-rates-2022.pdf">the agency reported</a> that 817 women died during or soon after pregnancy from causes “related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management.” Maternal mortality is often expressed as a ratio of maternal deaths to live births: For 2022, that ratio was 22.3 deaths per 100,000 births. That was less than in 2021, when the rate was 32.9 per 100,000, but still a marked increase from 2003, when the rate was 12.1 per 100,000.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also much higher than rates around the world. A recent <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2024/jun/insights-us-maternal-mortality-crisis-international-comparison">study by the Commonwealth Fund</a>, a foundation focused on health care access, found the US had the highest maternal mortality rate of any wealthy country. For comparison, Canada had 8.4 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2022, Japan had 3.4, and Switzerland had just 1.2.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The CDC has also found severe inequities within the US — in 2022, the mortality rate for Black women was 49.5 deaths per 100,000 births, more than twice the rate for white women — and the agency reports that more than 80 percent of pregnancy-related deaths in the US <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/features/maternal-mortality/index.html">are preventable</a>, based on analysis by teams of OB-GYNs, midwives, and other experts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The criticisms of the CDC’s measurement stem from a change in the way the agency counts maternal deaths. Until the 1990s, countries typically counted a death as maternal if pregnancy or a related condition was listed as the “underlying cause of death” on a death certificate, according to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/rise-us-maternal-mortality-rates-measurement">an analysis published in May by Saloni Dattani at Our World in Data</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this approach missed many deaths in which pregnancy or childbirth exacerbated an underlying condition, like AIDS or cardiovascular disease. Officials with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), a system used around the world for classifying death and illness, came to the conclusion that maternal deaths were being undercounted, and in 1994, they recommended that countries add a “pregnancy checkbox” to death certificates to signify whether the deceased had been pregnant or had recently given birth. This would help analysts determine if pregnancy contributed to a death.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">US states began adding the checkbox to their death certificates in 2003; by 2017, all had done so. Over this period, nationwide maternal mortality also rose significantly, from 12.1 deaths per 100,000 in 2003 to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2020/202001_MMR.htm">17.4 per 100,000 in 2018</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, some experts are taking a closer look at the checkbox and the effect it has had on how we understand childbirth in America. They have two separate but related criticisms. Let’s break them down.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Some critics argue that the maternal mortality rate isn’t really rising</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dattani, a researcher who specializes in global health, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/rise-us-maternal-mortality-rates-measurement">writes that</a> in order to prevent maternal deaths, “it’s crucial to have accurate data.” To that end, her May analysis at Our World in Data explains research first conducted by <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_044-508.pdf">the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics</a> (NCHS) in 2020, adding background and context. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dattani concludes that the increase in maternal deaths between 2003 and 2017 — the period when states were adding the pregnancy checkbox to their death certificates — can be attributed largely, or maybe even entirely, to the addition of the box. That is, pregnancy didn’t get more dangerous during that time period, officials just got better at measuring the deaths connected to it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This conclusion is a big deal because a lot of <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/07/04/1185904749/u-s-maternal-deaths-keep-rising-heres-who-is-most-at-risk">recent</a> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-maternal-mortality-rates-are-getting-worse-across-the-u-s/">coverage</a> of maternal mortality has been based on the notion that rates are skyrocketing. If that narrative is false, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/no-more-women-arent-dying-in-childbirth/678486/">some argue</a>, such coverage risks baselessly frightening people who are considering having kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this case, the critics are right, to a point. Most experts agree with Dattani’s conclusion. The CDC’s research “shows that observed increases in nationwide maternal mortality rates between 2003 and 2017 were largely due to the implementation of the checkbox, which increased identification of maternal deaths,” a spokesperson told Vox in a statement. The CDC has been open about that fact since at least <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2020/202001_MMR.htm">2020</a>, but the issue of the checkbox received little public attention until now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, the number of maternal deaths also continued to rise after 2017, when all states had adopted the checkbox. Some of the rise after 2020, Dattani and <a href="https://parentdata.org/revisiting-cdcs-maternal-mortality-data/">others</a> say, may be due to Covid, which was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/16/health/covid-pregnancy-protection.html">especially dangerous for pregnant people</a>, particularly before the arrival of vaccines. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line is that the pregnancy checkbox probably explains a lot of the increase in reported maternal mortality over the past several decades, but not all of it. Meanwhile, there’s another big point of contention around the checkbox and its impact.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Other researchers say the CDC overcounts maternal deaths</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The addition of the pregnancy checkbox has led the CDC to classify deaths as related to pregnancy when they really aren’t, contends a research team led by K.S. Joseph, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of British Columbia. For example, pregnant women who die of cancer can be classified as cases of maternal mortality, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/3/16/24102224/maternal-mortality-rate-study-united-states">the researchers argued</a> in <a href="https://www.ajog.org/article/S0002-9378(24)00005-X/fulltext">a paper</a> published in March in the <em>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Using a more conservative methodology, the researchers calculated a maternal mortality rate of 10.4 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2018-2021, compared to the 23.6 per 100,000 reported by the CDC for that timeframe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Critics of the CDC numbers are not advocating for pulling resources away from maternal health initiatives. Women’s reproductive health in general <a href="https://www.vox.com/health/23744536/fibroids-black-women-chemicals-phthalates-hair-relaxers-stress-diet-vitamin-d">remains</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23715434/baby-pregnancy-labor-due-date-premature-birth">underfunded</a>, and money set aside to combat maternal mortality is often a drop in the bucket of state and federal budgets. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, some scholars and advocates are concerned that criticism of the CDC’s count could lead to maternal health work being deprioritized. “It would be an unfortunate setback to see all the hard work of health care professionals, policy makers, patient advocates, and other stakeholders be undermined by this publication,” Christopher Zahn, interim CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, wrote in <a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2024/03/despite-new-manuscript-incontrovertible-evidence-proves-unacceptably-high-us-maternal-mortality-rate">response</a> to the research by Joseph and his team.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The CDC also strongly disputes that research, arguing that the methodology used by Joseph and his team would significantly undercount maternal deaths. A pregnant woman who dies of cancer is actually an example of maternal mortality if she has to pause her chemotherapy during pregnancy and her cancer advances as a result, the CDC spokesperson told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without the checkbox system, the spokesperson said, many deaths would simply be missed: “Capturing these otherwise unrecorded maternal deaths is critical to understanding the scope of maternal mortality in the United States and taking effective public health action to prevent these deaths.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others also agree that capturing deaths from underlying conditions that may be worsened by pregnancy is crucial for public health. “We know that poor health entering into pregnancy can lead to mortality postpartum in the ‘fourth trimester,’” Louise King, a professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard University, told Vox in an email. “Shouldn&#8217;t we want to classify the death of a pregnant person with hypertension as a maternal death? So that we can address what might be the underlying cause of this — lack of preventative health care, lack of appropriate postpartum care given current insurance coverage in [the] US?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And many scholars, including Dattani, agree that the introduction of the checkbox has led to better data, not worse. “My view is not that this is overestimating,” she told Vox. “In fact, it&#8217;s identifying maternal deaths that had been missed in the past.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, is there a maternal mortality crisis in the US?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if the CDC data isn’t perfect, many scholars agree that far too many people are dying during and after childbirth in the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We have many sources of information about maternal mortality, said Laurie Zephyrin, a senior vice president for advancing health equity at the Commonwealth Fund. The CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics releases the numbers that have been most debated recently, but the agency also has a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-mortality/php/pregnancy-mortality-surveillance/index.html">Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System</a> that employs medical epidemiologists to comb through death records from pregnancy up to a year after birth. Meanwhile, state and local <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/maternal-mortality/php/mmrc/index.html">maternal mortality review committees</a> also independently investigate maternal deaths. “All three of these ways of collecting data are showing that we have a problem in this country,” Zephyrin said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can also understand US maternal health better by putting it an international context. Comparing maternal mortality across countries can be complex, for some of the same reasons it’s complicated to count maternal deaths within the US. Some countries use a pregnancy checkbox like the one added in the US while others do not, leading to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/rise-us-maternal-mortality-rates-measurement">concerns</a> that other nations may be underreporting maternal deaths, making the US <a href="https://www.governing.com/management-and-administration/no-the-maternal-mortality-rate-is-not-rising">look worse</a> by comparison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, we know that the US lags behind other countries when it comes to policies proven to improve maternal (and overall) health. Among wealthy countries, the US is the only one without universal health care, said Munira Gunja, a senior researcher with the Commonwealth Fund’s International Program in Health Policy and Practice Innovations. It&#8217;s also the only one without federally mandated paid parental leave, and it&#8217;s the only country that doesn’t provide home visits and other comprehensive postpartum care, instead often limiting birthing people to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2020/07/14/many-new-moms-are-cleared-six-weeks-after-birth-postpartum-period-isnt-over/">a lone doctor’s appointment</a> six weeks after birth. “The US is a clear outlier, particularly when it comes to postpartum support,” Gunja said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, everyone involved in the debate over counting maternal deaths agrees that Black birthing people are dying at a disproportionately high rate. That disparity shows up whether you use the CDC’s method or Joseph’s, and it’s indicative of bigger problems within the US health care system, experts say. Black Americans in general have <a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/what-is-driving-widening-racial-disparities-in-life-expectancy/">a lower life expectancy</a> than white Americans, and Black babies are <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/death-rates-among-black-people-in-the-u-s-are-rising-after-falling/">more likely to be stillborn</a> or die in infancy. “This is across the board, not just in maternal health,” said Angela D. Aina, co-founder and executive director of the <a href="https://blackmamasmatter.org/">Black Mamas Matter Alliance</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some have argued that the language of “crisis” is unproductive, frightening pregnant people and prospective parents and clouding the search for solutions. “The constant drumbeat that maternal mortality is ‘<a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/527806002/focus-on-infants-during-childbirth-leaves-u-s-moms-in-danger">commonplace</a>’ and that pregnancy is ‘<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr51/007/2010/en/">deadly</a>’ doesn’t empower me with information to make my own decisions,” Jerusalem Demsas writes at <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/05/no-more-women-arent-dying-in-childbirth/678486/">the Atlantic</a>. “It just stresses me out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reasonable people can disagree over what constitutes a crisis and over the best way to measure how often Americans experience the tragic situation in which a person who is already sick dies from their illness after giving birth. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But experts do not disagree on the basic premise that too many pregnant and birthing people are dying in America, that many of their deaths are preventable, and that we already know some of the reforms — from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7367791/">paid leave</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24092448/black-mothers-maternal-mortality-crisis-solutions">better prenatal and postpartum care</a> — that would save their lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The great debate in the left-of-center political world is underway. Should Joe Biden stay on the 2024 ticket, or should he quit the race?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden doubters argue that the president, already trailing Trump, demonstrated during last week’s debate that his age will likely doom his candidacy. They say his polling has been bad for years and he has proved unable to turn it around, so if Democrats want to win — if they want to prevent the dangers of a Trump second term — they should nominate someone else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden defenders respond: Not so. While Biden may be the underdog, he still has a real chance of winning, they say. So switching him out in favor of an untested candidate, via an elite-dominated process with little recent precedent, could turn out to be a total disaster, ensuring the Trump victory it’s meant to prevent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Naturally, not everyone is making up their minds for purely disinterested reasons. Career incentives, personal loyalties, ambitions, grudges, inertia, or agendas on unrelated issues all help explain why some people are backing or opposing Biden. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, the loudest “dump Biden” voices have been media commentators, who have very different career incentives than the elected Democrats, nearly all of whom are so far backing him publicly. Meanwhile, resentment and suspicion against Biden’s top aides and family have risen due to a belief they’ve been hiding his condition. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So this is not exactly a high-minded debate in which everyone is reasonably weighing arguments to determine the best path forward for the party and the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if you are torn on whether replacing Biden would be a good idea, here are three questions that could help clarify your thoughts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1) How wounded is Biden politically?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden doubters view the debate as a catastrophe but believe the president’s political problems long predated — and will postdate — that event. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They point out that Trump has narrowly led <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden">most national polls</a> since last fall and that he has an Electoral College advantage on top of that. Those polls could well get worse after the debate; it’s too early to say for sure (some so far have shown <a href="https://nhjournal.com/trump-holds-narrow-lead-over-biden-in-post-debate-st-as-poll-of-nh-voters/">real damage</a> while others have shown <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/01/biden-poll-shows-no-change/">little change</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the Biden doubters fear that the voters’ perception of the president as an aged, declining, doddering incompetent has been cemented by the debate and that it will be very difficult for Biden to turn that around.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s defenders, in contrast, believed he was not in such a bad polling position before the debate. Though he trailed, it was not by an overwhelming amount, and he still had a plausible Electoral College path to victory by winning Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Election forecast models varied between giving Biden <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/">about a 1 in 2 shot</a> to win, or a <a href="https://x.com/AlecStapp/status/1806007153922121760">1 in 3 shot</a>. They point to stronger-than-expected Democratic performance in the 2022 midterms, and in recent special elections, to argue that the polls might be missing something.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the debate itself, they’ve argued that it was a fluke: one bad night, optimistically pointing to Biden’s vigorous speech at a rally the following day as a contrast. Even if his polls decline afterward, the election is still months away and, they hope, Biden has ample time to turn things around.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the doubters respond with the worry that Biden lacks the capacity to turn things around. They point to the White House’s longtime avoidance of placing the president in unscripted adversarial settings — which, they now suspect, reveals a belief that the president likely can’t sustain scrutiny in such settings because his age really has affected him. Why, they ask, hasn’t he done an interview or press conference since the debate to put the doubts at rest?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2) How politically risky is the process for replacing Biden?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s defenders typically lean very heavily on the argument that, whatever the president’s flaws, ditching him would likely result in a worse outcome.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They argue that the obvious choice to replace Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, would herself be a weak nominee as stories about Harris’s political struggles as veep <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html">have</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html">been</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/11/kamala-harris-vice-presidency-2024-election-biden-age/675439/">legion</a>. However, they say, passing over Harris, a woman of color, to anoint someone else would be highly controversial. Throwing open the nomination process at the convention would invite chaos and intra-party fights, forfeiting one of the party’s best opportunities to message its case against Donald Trump, and likely leaving Democrats embittered rather than united. Better to close ranks, stick with the plan, and make the case for Biden. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These fears are exaggerated, the dump Biden camp claims. Some recent polling <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/cnn-poll-post-debate/index.html">has shown</a> Harris performing better than Biden. Any ambitious Democrats who weren’t picked would eventually unite around the greater goal of stopping Trump. An open convention might be messy, but it would also bring attention and excitement to the party. A new nominee could get a burst of good feeling from voters who dislike both Biden and Trump. And in any case, even if the fears of chaos are well-founded, perhaps they’re still preferable to sticking with Biden given his diminished chances.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polling evidence on how Biden substitutes would fare against Trump has typically shown <a href="https://x.com/ShaneGoldmacher/status/1807252295572226519/photo/1">only minor differences</a>. In my view, such polling isn’t worth very much. The replacement’s prospects would depend on many things that haven’t happened yet, such as how their nomination process plays out and how they hold up to attacks from Trump and the right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there is an interesting implicit disagreement here. The Biden doubters believe that the Democratic Party is politically strong, that it’s the president who’s the problem, and that if they replace him with somebody else, they have a good shot of being fine. Biden’s defenders, in contrast, seem to think that the president is the only one holding the party together. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3) Will Biden hold up to a second term?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of the above has been framed under the assumption that the most important thing is to defeat Trump. That’s of a piece with how the discussion has generally unfolded in Democratic circles.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But is there reason to worry about Biden himself in a second term? Is replacing him with another Democrat not only the politically wise thing to do but the morally right thing to do for the country?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many Democrats have long viewed the Biden “age issue” as overstated and, to the extent they were concerned about it, those concerns were about perception and politics, not governance. Biden had, they believed, been a good and effective president. Sure, he wasn’t the best communicator, but he’d passed major new legislation, rallied the defense of Ukraine, and put the nation on a path to economic recovery. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among some, there was even an unspoken assumption that perhaps Joe Biden’s condition doesn’t matter that much because he’s appointed good people. Basically, that the Democratic coalition and foreign policy establishment are in charge and they’ve got things under control, so how bad would it be? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that debate may spur some reexamination of those premises. Will the candidate who was on that stage hold up through four and a half more years in the Oval Office? Would his ability to manage foreign and domestic crises be limited? How would foreign leaders view him? Isn’t communication part of the job of being president? Might it be better for the country to have a different Democrat in charge?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the goal of national Democrats is to keep Donald Trump out of the White House to protect democracy — and <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/358061/democrats-biden-trump-existential-threat-democracy-debate">they’ve largely framed the 2024 election in just those existential terms</a> — who is best equipped to do it? And after a dismal debate performance by President Joe Biden last week, is it possible that there is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024">another Democrat</a> better equipped to beat Trump than the sitting president?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polling gives us one way to answer that question. But it’s not as simple as looking at the topline numbers and deciding that it’s time to dump Biden. The only timeline for which we know anything, solidly, is the one we’re living in: anything else is purely hypothetical, and requires some suspension of belief, some scrutiny in looking at numbers, and some skepticism in how we might expect the public to react.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we know: The data shows a wash</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a few different ways to judge how a hypothetical non-Biden candidate might fare against Trump:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Head-to-head polling, which asks voters who they would vote for: Trump or [insert Democrat here]?&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polls taken before Thursday all largely deliver the same answer: any Biden alternative — <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357948/url-harris-replace-biden-trump-debate-reaction-polling-vice-presidency">Vice President Kamala Harris</a>, Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Gavin Newsom of California, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg — performed about the same, or worse, than Biden against Trump when voters were asked how they’d vote in head-to-head matchups.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In averages of national polls fielded between February 2023 and January of this year, for example, Harris underperformed Biden by <a href="https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1755963760173289503/photo/1">about 2.3 percentage points</a>, per tracking by the former Democratic pollster Adam Carlson.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/03/05/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html">New York Times/Siena College poll</a> asked this question of likely voters. Harris received the support of about 42 percent of respondents against the 48 percent who said they’d back Trump, trailing by 6 points. Biden, by comparison, received the support of 44 percent of respondents against Trump’s 48, trailing by 4 points. The 2-point gap is within the margin of error, so there’s little daylight between Biden and his vice president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Less polling data exists for non-Harris alternatives. Back in February, Carlson <a href="https://x.com/admcrlsn/status/1756003253190357282/photo/1">also compiled</a> the results of different polls in that same period that asked voters to choose between Trump and Whitmer, Newsom, Buttigieg, or Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Bernie Sanders of Vermont. All those polls were conducted at various points in those 11 months, by different pollsters, about different hypothetical matchups.&nbsp;He found that only Manchin did better than Biden — but based on just one poll.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Buttigieg, Newsom, and Sanders did worse than Biden against Trump (Newsom, for example, trailed Biden’s margin against Trump in every poll in which he was included, by about 3 percentage points on average). Whitmer did roughly the same as Biden, but that’s also based on only two polls.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even more recently, a <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24787646/cnn-poll.pdf">new CNN national survey</a> of registered voters taken in the two days after the debate gives us one more data point. It’s one that suggests these alternative candidates could do a bit better than the president. Biden still trails Trump by 6 points, the same margin as before Thursday. When compared to Trump in hypothetical match-ups, Buttigieg, Newsom, and Whitmer all trail by about 4 or 5 points. Only Harris does significantly better: down by 2 points against Trump.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Who’s better-liked?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another way to ask this question is to look at the favorability ratings of Biden, Biden alternatives, and Trump. Biden and Trump are both historically disliked political figures —  Biden himself is the most unpopular modern president since … Trump. The latest source of information we had<strong> </strong>before the debate is the Economist/YouGov’s poll <a href="https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/econTabReport_DqmBE9q.pdf">from the last week of June</a>, which asked about approval ratings for Trump, Biden, and Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The poll found that Trump is disliked by 57 percent of Americans and liked by 39 percent, putting him at -18 percent. Biden is viewed similarly: disliked by 58 percent of the public and liked by 39 percent, placing him at -19 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris does slightly better: disliked by 54 percent, and liked by 37 percent, placing her at -17 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, Harris is viewed slightly less negatively than Biden is, but she isn’t significantly more popular.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latest CNN poll shows this too: Harris has a negative net favorability rating, -20, similar to Biden’s -24. Meanwhile, Trump’s is -15. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polling aggregates of favorability ratings show something similar. In the Real Clear Politics average, <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/favorability/kamala-harris">Harris</a> holds a -15.4 point rating; <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/favorability/joe-biden">Biden</a> stands at -15.9; <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump">Trump</a> stands at -11.2. Biden and Harris are viewed roughly the same.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the debate, we really only had one clear source on how Americans view these figures: a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2024/6/29/in-post-debate-poll-voters-think-biden-is-too-old-to-be-president-yet-alternative-candidates-perform-similarly-against-trump">Data for Progress flash poll</a> fielded the day after the debate. This one poll of about 1,000 likely voters has been <em>the </em>key evidence used by Biden defenders and Biden critics to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/358461/replace-joe-biden-drop-out-kamala-harris">make their cases</a>, but it shows pretty much what we saw before the debate: no alternative candidate does better than Biden against Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In terms of vote share, Harris performs roughly the same as Biden, garnering the support of 45 percent of likely voters against Trump’s 48 percent. Other Democrats, like Buttigieg, Newsom, Whitmer, and Shapiro, win slightly smaller shares of the electorate — anywhere from 44 to 43 percent of likely voters. But at the same time, in those matchups, the share of undecided voters grows. Trump’s support, meanwhile, stays steadily between 46 and 47.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What we&#8217;re seeing pretty frequently is that Trump&#8217;s numbers are pretty solid. Trump doesn&#8217;t move much,” <a href="https://www.gqrr.com/team/natalie-jackson/">Natalie Jackson</a>, a pollster and vice president at the GQR public opinion research firm, told me. “He stays pretty steady right around where he was in 2020.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These are all national polls. If you’re wondering who might do better in the specific battleground states crucial to winning the Electoral College vote, we simply don’t have data.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we don’t know</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it’s too soon to tell just what the American people are thinking about replacing Biden with an alternative.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plenty of political developments and newsworthy events are still unfolding, influencing how people think about Thursday night.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even the one poll everyone has been referencing since Thursday should be viewed with a grain of salt, Jackson told me, since it was put together and fielded quickly, opening it up to some bias, since it’s taking stock of the type of people who would be willing to answer questions about the debate almost immediately.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We won’t know for two or three weeks how all of this bakes into the numbers, and now we have <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">the immunity case</a> stacked on top of it, so it’s possible that we’re not ever going to really know how this one event played out,” she told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Next, we are dealing in hypotheticals. Any talk about how a Biden alternative would fare against Trump is purely imaginary at this point: we don’t really know how well any of these candidates would do among specific kinds of voters or in different states or regions. How would Whitmer do in the Sun Belt? How would Newsom do in the Midwest? Those questions are crucial to winning the Electoral College, and the polls we have don’t come close to answering them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nor do we know how any of these candidates would get to the top of the ticket, and how their path would influence their popularity (or lack thereof). Would the nomination flow to Harris, who seems like the logical successor despite years of negative coverage? Would she be passed up in favor of Newsom, Whitmer, or Shapiro — and if so, how would the Democratic base, especially Black voters, respond to the first Black female vice president being sidelined so publicly? Would this all be fought out at the floor of an open convention in Chicago? And would all that chaos end up dealing the eventual nominee the same kind of damage that Biden’s age is dealing him right now?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are, broadly speaking, two ways to look at the data we do have.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first is that the polls show hypothetical Biden alternatives would do no better than Biden (generally what Biden defenders say). The second is that they are doing just as well as Biden without even running as actual presidential candidates — and could do better still (what Biden critics say).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But neither side can fully claim to be right, and there are strong counterarguments to both sides. The <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2024/6/29/in-post-debate-poll-voters-think-biden-is-too-old-to-be-president-yet-alternative-candidates-perform-similarly-against-trump">DFP poll</a>, for example, shows that Harris, post-debate, still has a better favorability score than Biden, and is doing better than the president with women, Latino voters, and young voters — groups that Biden has <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2024/06/30/the-case-for-and-against-joe-biden/">struggled with overall</a>. Philip Bump at the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/06/28/kamala-harris-trump-matchup/">did some digging</a> on this question last week as well, comparing Harris and Biden’s favorability ratings among subgroups before the debate, and found Harris seems to be viewed more favorably by younger voters, women, and non-white voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, respondents are likely still not seeing Harris or alternatives as actual options, instead seeing these names as stand-ins for a “generic Democrat” — anyone who is not Joe Biden. Each of these alternatives is less well known than Biden in DFP’s poll; unless you’re super plugged into political news or from the Midwest, you probably don’t know who Gretchen Whitmer is; if you know of Gavin Newsom, you probably have strong feelings about him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whitmer, Shapiro, and Buttigieg, for example, all have better net favorability ratings than Biden or Harris in the DFP poll, but many <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2024/6/29/in-post-debate-poll-voters-think-biden-is-too-old-to-be-president-yet-alternative-candidates-perform-similarly-against-trump#:~:text=Voters%E2%80%99%20Perceptions%20of%20Biden%20and%20Alternative%20Democratic%20Candidates">respondents say</a> they haven’t heard enough about these people to form an opinion. For Shapiro, Whitmer, and Buttigieg, the share of respondents who haven’t heard of them is much larger than the share who can form a positive or negative opinion. Newsom is the best-known of these alternatives, but he’s also disliked nearly as much as Biden, and more than Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being little-known isn’t necessarily a bad thing. To optimists about the alterna-Bidens, it means that there is more room for these candidates to grow, for the public to get to know them, and to put forward a new, positive message.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s also a pessimistic side: You’re less publicly vetted and more vulnerable to skeletons in the closet. Many would also be trying a first national campaign on the highest-stakes platform possible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In short, we don’t know much. These are all hypotheticals we’re trying to game out from a very limited set of data. And we’re likely to get a bunch more data as we move further from the debate. As that happens, Jackson urged a word of caution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think we&#8217;re in a position where there&#8217;s so much going on that we haven&#8217;t seen before that we should treat polling skeptically and as what it is: a snapshot of what opinion looks like in the moment that could change.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican party is going in two directions on race&nbsp;at the same time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Electorally speaking, the modern GOP has never been so diverse. Each of the past two elections, and most available 2024 polling, reveals the GOP making real inroads with Black and (especially) Latino voters. These gains <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23982907/trump-democrats-republicans-working-class-voters-latino-black-voters">shouldn’t be overstated</a> —&nbsp;Democrats still dominate among non-whites as a whole — but they are real.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But at the elite level, conservative intellectuals and operatives are developing a new doctrine of white identity politics. And it’s already shaping the Trump administration’s plans for a second term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A new book on “anti-white racism” — <em>The Unprotected Class</em>, by Claremont Institute fellow Jeremy Carl — illustrates this trend clearly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Its April release went unheralded outside conservative circles, but it received laudatory attention inside them. Tucker Carlson praised it as “outstanding”; leading activist <a href="https://www.vox.com/23811277/christopher-rufo-culture-wars-ron-desantis-florida-critical-race-theory-anti-wokeness">Chris Rufo</a> described it as a “must-read.” Nate Hochman, a former speechwriter for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, called it “<a href="https://x.com/njhochman/status/1773026164765872213">the most important thing you read this year</a>.” Carl got friendly interviews on <a href="https://x.com/realJeremyCarl/status/1793780627201782177">Donald Trump Jr.’s web show</a> and on <a href="https://x.com/realJeremyCarl/status/1794074114312806660">Fox News during primetime</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carl’s book centers on the claim that “anti-white racism is the most predominant and politically powerful form of racism in America today.” What mainstream scholars of race call “white privilege” is, in his view, a series of “informal evanescent cultural legacies.” By contrast, anti-white discrimination “is increasingly legal and formal.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This discrimination is, for Carl, primarily the product of a pernicious ideology popular among elites (nonwhite and white alike). “Anti-white racism is the all-but-official ideology of our ruling regime,” he writes —&nbsp;and they have acted in such a way as to ensure that whites are increasingly shunted to the bottom of America’s social hierarchy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carl’s arguments for this view resemble a funhouse mirror version of American racial history: roughly the same series of events, but with the roles of victim and perpetrator reversed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone agrees, for example, that the integration of America’s cities led white people to move to suburbs and other outlying areas. Traditionally, <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691133867/white-flight">historians</a> and <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/why-us-cities-are-segregated-race-new-evidence-role-white-flight">social scientists</a> see this as a manifestation of white racism: either white urbanites worried about the effects of integration on property values or they simply disliked living near Black people. The flight of white wealth then deprived Black people and neighborhoods of high-quality public services, recreating the inequalities of de jure segregation on a de facto basis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Carl argues that white flight can more accurately be described as a reaction to anti-white racism. He claims that integration brings crime, often involving minority perpetrators targeting longtime white residents (Carl sources data on “interracial murder” to the anonymous Twitter account @fentasyl). The situation for whites is so perilous, Carl argues, that it’s akin to state-sanctioned mob assaults on Jews in czarist Russia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Anti-white crime functions as a twenty-first-century <em>de facto</em> pogrom, driving whites out of areas where they have lived for decades,” he writes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carl’s version of white identity politics is hardly isolated on the intellectual right. He cites two other prominent book, by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Age-Entitlement-America-Since-Sixties/dp/1501106899">New York Times contributor Christopher Caldwell</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Origins-Woke-Corporate-Identity-Politics/dp/0063237210/ref=pd_bxgy_d_sccl_2/133-8685539-4311037?pd_rd_w=tvrkS&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.d09bc3f2-0166-4869-be1b-350c42c0f80c&amp;pf_rd_p=d09bc3f2-0166-4869-be1b-350c42c0f80c&amp;pf_rd_r=X3Z9GHD990895R7011R0&amp;pd_rd_wg=XjAKK&amp;pd_rd_r=645481f5-5e00-405f-ab81-7d8858bf46b7&amp;pd_rd_i=0063237210&amp;psc=1">think tanker Richard Hanania</a>, to argue that the legal roots of anti-white racism were created by the legislative victories of the civil rights movement. Their accounts align on the idea that the basic structure of anti-discrimination protections —&nbsp;including the Civil Rights Act of 1965 —&nbsp;needs to be overhauled or repealed entirely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, conservatives have complained about “reverse racism” for decades. What’s new is not just the aggressiveness of Carl’s claims and others like them, but their direct connection to radical policy proposals — and the fact that people in positions of power appear to be listening.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In April, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/01/trump-reverse-racism-civil-rights">Axios’s Alex Thompson reported</a> that “close Trump allies” are planning a second-term overhaul of anti-discrimination law, one that would “dramatically change the government&#8217;s interpretation of Civil Rights-era laws to focus on ‘anti-white racism’ rather than discrimination against people of color.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of this work, per Thompson, is coming out of America First Legal — the law practice of infamous Trump aide Stephen Miller. Since leaving government, Miller has filed a number of lawsuits alleging anti-white discrimination. Examples include <a href="https://aflegal.org/america-first-legal-blasts-the-nfls-illegal-and-racist-rooney-rule-files-federal-civil-rights-complaint/">a suit against the NFL’s “Rooney Rule</a>,” which requires teams to interview a minority candidate for some high-level coaching positions, as well as a successful bid to block pandemic assistance <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/554361-federal-judge-says-biden-restaurant-fund-discriminated-against-white-male/">for women-and-minority-owned restaurants</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Miller is poised to play an important role in a second Trump administration. Ty Cobb, Trump’s former attorney, told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/08/trump-second-term-lawyers-stephen-miller">the Guardian</a> that “Trump is looking to Miller” when it comes to choosing his White House lawyers and Justice Department officials. With that kind of power, Miller’s quest to write white identity politics into law could well start succeeding next year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a hard time to be someone who works in the heat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just two weeks after a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/20/heat-wave-record-temperatures">blistering heat dome</a> smothered parts of the Midwest and Northeast, yet another heat wave is set to <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/02/heat-wave-california-oregon-wildfires">break temperature records</a> in California.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s an unforgiving start to a summer that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/16/record-hot-summer-2024-us-la-nina">projections</a> show could be the hottest on record. Exposure to extreme heat can be deadly&nbsp;— <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/extreme-heat/about/index.html">around 1,200 Americans</a> die from it every year (a <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/16/extreme-heat-related-deaths-climate-change-estimates/">number</a> that’s likely <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/30/nx-s1-4854224/death-heat-arizona-climate-change-medical-examiner">severely undercounted</a>), making extreme heat perhaps one of <a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/">the deadliest of all weather events in the US</a>. And even when heat doesn’t kill or hospitalize people outright, it can <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/7/21/23799004/invisible-consequences-extreme-heat-physical-mental-health">silently harm</a> our physical and mental health through straining the heart and altering our behavior around risks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Weather Service <a href="https://x.com/nwswpc/status/1802796988444160291?s=46&amp;t=mPnbvyFgt7avJRNpnS1BDw">recommends</a> people spend time in air-conditioned spaces, shade, and to consistently hydrate during intense heat waves. But for more than <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/0983100fa18744fc97bd477d9879a9f8">30 million</a> workers whose job requires them to work outdoors, like farmworkers or construction workers, those NWS recommendations aren’t often accessible, let alone guaranteed, on the job. The very nature of their work leaves them as much as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4657558/">35 times more at risk</a> of dying from heat exposure than the general public. And heat waves like this one are expected to increase in frequency <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/7/5/23784587/hottest-day-heat-wave-recorded-temperature-climate-change">thanks to climate change</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lulu Guerrero, an undocumented farmworker in Colorado, told Vox she has fainted twice from the heat — once last year and once the year prior. “Two years ago, the temperature was about 105 degrees,” she said in Spanish. “It’s very difficult for us, because we still have to keep working to earn money, because of the needs we have. These are the experiences working in the fields leave you with — sometimes beautiful, sometimes very hard.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just outdoor work that puts people at risk of heat injury or death. Some indoor workers, like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/08/economy/phoenix-cleaners-hot-airplanes/index.html">airplane cabin cleaners</a> or <a href="https://truthout.org/articles/kitchen-workers-demand-federal-protections-against-excessive-heat/">kitchen cooks</a>, also experience scorching temperatures in their line of work, as confined spaces and proximity to ovens without AC can cause a person to overheat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How one perceives and responds to heat varies from person to person, but the Occupational Health and Safety Administration says that a <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/354977/heat-wave-wet-bulb-temperature-climate">wet bulb temperature</a> (a more accurate method of understanding heat risk by measuring temperature, humidity, and sunlight) of 77 degrees or more can make strenuous work unsafe. From 2011 to 2021, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2023/36-work-related-deaths-due-to-environmental-heat-exposure-in-2021.htm">the Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reported 436 workplace deaths due to heat exposure, and from 2010 to 2020, almost <a href="https://www.osha.gov/heat/sbrefa">34,000 workers</a> suffered a heat-related injury that required time away from their job. OSHA has pointed out that it’s likely that these numbers are also a vast undercount.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know how dangerous heat can be, and we know that danger is likely to amplify with each summer, yet there’s no federal protection for workers against heat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that might change soon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, after years of worker activism on the issue, OSHA began the process of developing a ruling on a <a href="https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure/rulemaking">heat workplace standard</a>, with the aim to reduce heat-related injuries and death on the job. This standard would create a set of obligations that employers must comply with to protect their workers from heat. It generally takes about seven years for OSHA to publish a final ruling. On Tuesday morning, the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/biden-heat-rules-climate-deaths-00166162" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/biden-heat-rules-climate-deaths-00166162">Biden administration</a> made its proposal for a heat standard public — but it won&#8217;t be final until 2026, at the very least. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OSHA might face some resistance, though. Historically, some employers and business groups have been opposed to a mandatory heat standard and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/31/heat-protections-workers-big-business-lobbies">have lobbied against it in the past</a>. And if Donald Trump wins the presidency, it would likely upend the standard entirely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Time will tell what a final ruling for a workplace heat standard will be, and how well it will align with the needs of workers. Which invites the question: what would strong workplace protections against heat look like?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What workplace protections we do (and don’t) have against heat</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Long before President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/21/1039372888/the-biden-administration-is-adding-worker-protections-to-address-extreme-heat">pushed for OSHA to develop a heat illness prevention rule</a>, OSHA has understood heat as a hazard to workers — they created their first document for <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2016-106/pdfs/2016-106.pdf?id=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2016106">recommended heat standards</a> back in 1972. Their webpage on <a href="https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure">heat exposure</a> details how to spot heat illness and injuries, heat-related case studies from past OSHA investigations, and even updated criteria for a recommended heat standard for employers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that’s all it is: recommendations, guidance, suggestions. Unlike OSHA’s work safety standards, such as <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.134">respiratory protection</a> or their <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.1200">hazard communication</a> standard, none of the things OSHA lists on heat exposure are mandatory for employers to comply with until a final rule on heat is published.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What employers do have to comply with is OSHA’s <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/oshact/section_5">general duty clause</a>, which requires that they ensure the workplace is “free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.” In theory, this includes hazards like extreme heat. But in practice, it leaves a lot of room for employer discretion, and very little room for workers to demand more protections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In absence of a federal rule, five states have passed some sort of heat protection standards: California, Colorado, Minnesota, Washington, and Oregon. In 2022, Oregon’s state OSHA <a href="https://osha.oregon.gov/OSHARules/adopted/2022/ao3-2022-letter-alh-heat.pdf">adopted heat protection rules for both outdoor and indoor workers</a>, and just this week, California approved heat standards for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2024-06-20/after-backlash-cal-osha-board-to-vote-on-safeguards-for-hot-workplaces">indoor workers</a> nearly 20 years after they implemented a workplace heat rule for outdoor workers, <a href="https://calmatters.org/politics/capitol/2024/02/workplace-safety-california-indoor-heat/">the first of its kind</a>. The other states offer protections for only certain groups of laborers — Washington covers outdoor workers only, while Minnesota covers indoor workers and Colorado covers agricultural workers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably missing from this list are some of the United States’ hottest regions, such as the South, which is overwhelmingly dominated by state Republican legislatures. That doesn’t mean efforts haven’t been made to implement heat protections in those places, statewide or locally. In Texas, city councils in Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio passed ordinances to protect construction workers from the heat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But all of this was <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/12/workers-texas-heat-wave/#:~:text=There%20are%20no%20federal%20or,local%20rules%20with%20that%20purpose.">overturned by the Texas legislature</a> in 2023, when lawmakers passed a bill that restricted Texas counties and cities from developing laws that go beyond state law. The Florida legislature <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/12/1244316874/florida-blocks-heat-protections-for-workers-right-before-summer">did the same</a> when Miami-Dade County was on course to pass a heat protection standard for outdoor workers, a devastating blow to workers and labor advocates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">States developing heat protections for workers is a step in the right direction — but it’s only possible when the state government isn’t hostile to such regulations. A federal ruling would supersede any state laws on workplace heat standards (or lack thereof).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What could strong workplace protections against heat look like?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bare minimum needs for a federal workplace heat standard are “really pretty simple,” says <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/about/people/kristina-dahl">Kristina Dahl</a>, a principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It&#8217;s water, shade, and rest. And each of those needs to become progressively more present as the temperature or heat index increases.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Dahl also emphasizes that there should be clear standards for water, shade, and rest. There’s a difference between drinking cold water and drinking water that’s turned hot from the sun; between a true 15-minute rest break and doing light work while on a break; between resting in the shade of a truck and resting in the shade of a tent with air conditioning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dahl also wants to see workers’ wages protected during these breaks. In a <a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/too-hot-to-work">report</a> she co-wrote about the risk outdoor workers face from their exposure to extreme heat, Dahl said one of their findings was that “there&#8217;s the potential for workers to lose a lot in earnings if they&#8217;re not getting paid for these increasingly long rest breaks as the temperature increases.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The protection of pay is key for ensuring workers’ safety, says Antonio De Loera-Brust, communications director for <a href="https://ufw.org/">United Farm Workers</a>. A lot of outdoor workers make less than the national median income, which makes any potential loss to a paycheck especially difficult. Agricultural workers in particular make <a href="https://www.epi.org/blog/the-farmworker-wage-gap-farmworkers-earned-40-less-than-comparable-nonagricultural-workers-in-2022/">low wages</a> as is, and it’s still common for farmworkers to be paid by how much crops they harvest, rather than a secured hourly wage. All of this forces workers to decide between their income and their safety.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The economic incentive for workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, or living in poverty, or struggling with food on their own tables, is to push themselves to the limit,” De Loera-Brust told me. “They will push their bodies past the breaking point, and will suffer severe health consequences up to and including death, which happens every year.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to OSHA, <a href="https://www.osha.gov/heat-exposure">50 to 70 percent of heat-related fatalities</a> occur during the first week of work, because workers had not adequately acclimated to the heat. In Florida, a young farmworker <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article277382588.html">died from the heat</a> on his first day of work in January 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To prevent these unnecessary deaths, Dahl recommends “at least a two-week acclimation period, where there&#8217;s increasing work time in the heat.” And it’s not just those new to heat-exposed work who need to be acclimated to the heat — returning workers who have been away for an extended period, such as seasonal agricultural workers, also need time to get used to the heat again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last July, another young farmworker in Florida named Efraín López García died on the job, after working on farms for nearly a decade. His coworkers said they were never trained on how to spot heat illness or give first aid, <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/climate-change/article277399723.html">the Miami Herald reported</a>. To prevent tragic deaths like López García’s, it’s critical that a heat standard also includes mandatory training for workers to recognize the signs of heat stroke and exhaustion, first aid, and what their rights are — all provided in the language they speak.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if all criteria for a strong heat standard is met, then comes the issue of enforcement. A lot of workers in industries exposed to heat, like <a href="https://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/ETAOP2022-16_NAWS_Research_Report_16_508c.pdf">agriculture</a> and <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/02/EW-Construction-factsheet.pdf">construction</a>, are undocumented. Retaliation for standing up for their basic rights and needs can be a real threat to their income and livelihood, and can discourage workers from enforcing standards. There needs to be some sort of combination of worker empowerment, whether through unions or worker collectives, and anti-retaliation measures to ensure that the heat standard is actually imposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How different these key demands from workers and advocates will be from the final ruling on a heat standard is still up in the air. Even in some of the best-case scenarios, obstacles to a strong, enforceable rule lie ahead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about OSHA’s proposed heat standard, and what stands in the way</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <a href="https://www.regulations.gov/document/OSHA-2023-0003-0007">recommendations</a> from OSHA’s National Advisory Committee on Occupational Safety and Health work group, the proposed rule&nbsp;is aimed at both indoor and outdoor work. It <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/biden-heat-rules-climate-deaths-00166162" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/02/biden-heat-rules-climate-deaths-00166162">includes the following</a>: a temperature trigger for when the standard would take effect, mandatory 15-minute paid rest breaks for all employees after two hours, access to shade and water, and an acclimatization period for workers to get used to the heat.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are you a business owner with employees who work in the heat? Here’s how you can protect them.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s likely that we’re still years away from OSHA enforcing a standard to prevent heat illness and death, and until then, we’re bound to see more workers get injured or killed from extreme heat.&nbsp;If you’re an employer of workers exposed to heat, here are just a few key recommendations around heat safety in the meantime,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/recommendations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to NIOSH</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rest breaks:&nbsp;</strong>Allow for workers to cool down by ensuring consistent breaks, and increase rest breaks as the weather gets hotter.</li>



<li><strong>Hydrate:&nbsp;</strong>Provide enough potable water for all workers, and make sure it’s in easily accessible areas.</li>



<li><strong>Acclimatize:&nbsp;</strong>Gradually expose new workers to the heat for at least two weeks before they complete a full day’s worth of work in the heat.</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, talk to your employees. Workers on the ground will have crucial knowledge about what’s necessary to protect themselves from extreme heat, so their input and participation in creating a standard will be key to ensuring that it actually works.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of this aligns with what workers and advocates are calling for. But we’re likely still years away from a final ruling, says Jordan Barab, former deputy assistant secretary of labor at OSHA and writer of the newsletter <a href="https://jordanbarab.com/confinedspace/">Confined Space</a>. A lot could happen in the meantime, and it also provides ample room for threats to the rule — one major one being if Trump wins the presidency this fall. Trump would likely kill the OSHA’s initiative to develop protections against heat entirely, Barab told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if Biden can hold onto the White House, there’s a much better chance at seeing the rule come to life — though it will still be met with opposition. Some businesses and employers aren’t excited about the prospect of being required to protect workers from heat, and have actively lobbied against it at the federal and state level. They have said that such a standard would be too much of a burden for employers, and that they’re already doing what would be mandated (which, if that’s the case, then why worry about a standard being written down?). “We can certainly expect this one to be challenged in court,” Barab said about the heat standard.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While OSHA generally wins these legal battles, it’s still another obstacle that can cause delays. But in the meantime, some workers are taking matters into their own hands by writing <a href="https://grist.org/labor/heat-waves-are-making-restaurant-kitchens-unsafe-workers-are-fighting-back/">heat provisions</a> into their <a href="https://grist.org/accountability/chicago-teachers-want-climate-solutions-next-contract/?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=daily">union contracts</a>. At the end of the day, a federal ruling on a workplace heat standard would take some of the current pressure off workers to be solely responsible for their health on the job and move a large part of that responsibility onto employers. And with each summer we wait, more and more workers’ lives are at risk.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The clock is ticking,” said De Loera-Brust. “It&#8217;s already been over 100 degrees in much of the country this year. No one wants to be the last farmworker to die of heat.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricane Beryl reached Category 5 strength as it tore into the Caribbean on Monday, with sustained winds reaching 165 miles per hour. This marks the earliest point in the season on record that a tropical storm has reached this intensity. As of Tuesday morning, at least one death has been confirmed in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The storm is now heading toward Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, bringing “life-threatening winds and storm surge,” according to the <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT2+shtml/011153.shtml">National Hurricane Center</a>. The storm is expected to weaken as it reaches Mexico by the weekend.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hurricane Beryl has achieved the following:<br>– Earliest Category 4 on record in Atlantic<br>– Earliest Category 5 on record in Atlantic<br>– Fastest intensification before September in Atlantic<br>– Southernmost Category 4 on record<br><br>The fingerprint of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/climate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#climate</a> change is a solid one. <a href="https://t.co/tkv3zIbXwd">pic.twitter.com/tkv3zIbXwd</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Cappucci (@MatthewCappucci) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewCappucci/status/1807977650079633724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As unprecedented as the storm may be, it lines up with what scientists have been predicting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Atlantic Ocean has been gathering the raw materials for a raucous hurricane season for months and is now assembling them into major storms. Beryl is the Atlantic’s first big project for 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ocean surface temperatures are the foundation for hurricanes. The water needs to be around <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/tropical_stuff/hurricane_anatomy/hurricane_anatomy.html">80 degrees Fahrenheit</a> or warmer. Typically, the amount of hot water needed to power a major hurricane doesn’t accumulate until later in the summer, but the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/2/28/24085691/atlantic-ocean-warming-climate-change-hurricanes-coral-reefs-bleaching">Atlantic Ocean absorbed</a> a tremendous amount of heat in the past year as the planet heated up to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/23969523/climate-change-cop28-paris-1-5-c-uae-2023-record-warm">hottest average temperature on record</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other major component of hurricanes is the air above the water. Hurricanes thrive when there is minimal wind shear, a phenomenon where winds push in different directions as the altitude changes. They also count on less stability in the layers of temperature and moisture in the atmosphere. “Weak stability (not much density change with altitude) allows easier transport of moist air near the surface to rise in the atmosphere where it can form cumulus clouds that produce heavy rain,” said <a href="https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/scientist/dr-michael-james-mcphaden">Michael McPhaden</a>, a hurricane researcher at NOAA, in an email.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, the shift from <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific">El Niño to La Niña</a> in the Pacific Ocean is driving more of these hurricane-favorable atmospheric conditions over the Atlantic. That’s why forecasters have been warning since May that this summer will bring an <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season">above-normal hurricane season</a>, with upward of seven major hurricanes at Category 3 or above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beryl also stands out because of how quickly it <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/01/hurricane-beryl-rapid-intensification-warning-sign">gathered strength</a>. Meteorologists describe this trait as <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/9/28/23376761/hurricane-ian-rapid-intensification-climate-change">rapid intensification</a>, where a hurricane’s wind speeds rise by at least 35 miles per hour in 24 hours. Beryl picked up 65 mph between Saturday and Sunday, though still nowhere near as quick as <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23932000/hurricane-otis-mexico-acapulco-rapid-intensification-extreme-climate">Hurricane Otis</a>, which spun up almost 100 mph in 12 hours last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the while, the climate is changing and <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/">worsening some of the most destructive elements</a> of hurricanes. Warmer temperatures are lifting sea levels, so when tropical storms make landfall, they push more water inland. Warmer air also holds onto more moisture, so storms dish out more rain. Hotter water also tends to lead to more rapid intensification.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More people are living in areas vulnerable to cyclones, too, so as these storms spool up, more lives and property are at stake.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, the people living in some of the most vulnerable areas are taking steps to prepare for future hurricanes. In particular, Caribbean countries have been investing in <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23886118/climate-change-disaster-warning-hurricane-maria-dominica-caribbean">disaster early warning systems</a> that can identify brewing storms and alert residents to evacuate or seek shelter. The Caribbean warning system received <a href="https://wmo.int/media/news/new-funding-approved-strengthen-multi-hazard-early-warning-systems-caribbean">$7 million in funding</a> from the United Nations in May to upgrade disaster alerts and responses across countries in the region. It’s part of a broader $3.1 billion UN push to ensure that all people on Earth are protected by a <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/early-warnings-for-all">disaster early warning system by the end of 2027</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But warnings are only the first step. The people receiving the warnings need to be able to act on them. On small, resource-poor islands, the routes to safety are few and fragile. And the threat from Beryl may not end when the storm passes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Getting relief supplies into afflicted countries is likely to remain a challenge, and the damage from Beryl could leave the Caribbean <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous">more vulnerable to the next hurricane</a> that erupts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em><strong>Update, July 2, 10:05 am ET:</strong> This story was originally published on July 1 and has been updated with news that Hurricane Beryl has intensified. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last Thursday night, President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">advertised his inability</a> to reliably remember the topics of his own sentences to over 50 million Americans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president’s excruciating debate performance triggered an avalanche of op-eds calling for his exit from the race. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/biden-election-debate-trump.html">editorial board</a>, Biden’s <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/06/30/2024/totally-different-bidens-biographers-and-defenders-reckon-with-the-debate">(admiring) biographers</a>, and a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/30/opinion/biden-debate-convention.html">wide range</a> of liberal <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/biden-and-harris-absurd-case-for-post-debate-complacency.html">pundits</a> have all argued that the Democratic Party — and the country as a whole — would be better served by a different nominee, no matter how fraught the process of selecting a Biden replacement might be.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus far, Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/30/politics/biden-family-camp-david-debate/index.html">has rejected this view</a>. And some <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/30/biden-trump-chris-coons-00165938">Democratic politicians</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/01/biden-2024-election-pr-campaign-step-aside">operatives</a>, and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/fault-lines/the-case-for-joe-biden-staying-in-the-race">columnists</a> have fed him rationales for soldiering on.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, it has become clear that Biden staying in the race is making it more likely that Donald Trump will be the next president. To the contrary, the president’s conspicuous cognitive and rhetorical decline has rendered him an exceptionally weak candidate, whose odds of victory look much slimmer than any of the Democratic Party’s plausible alternatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To see why this is so, it’s worth examining five prominent arguments for Biden to remain in the race — and why they are misguided.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>1. “Biden’s post-debate poll numbers aren’t </strong><strong><em>that</em></strong><strong> bad.”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a memo <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/01/biden-poll-shows-no-change/">circulated among Democrats</a> Monday, the Biden campaign’s pollster Geoff Garin wrote that internal polling showed that the president had not lost substantial support since the debate: In his survey, Trump narrowly led Biden before Thursday night, and maintained roughly the same lead afterward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://x.com/danielmarans/status/1807893052016447846">fundraising email</a> over the weekend, meanwhile, the Biden campaign told supporters that “according to the polls” every high-profile alternative to the president would “be less likely to win than Joe Biden — the only person ever to defeat Donald Trump.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The basis for this claim was a post-debate <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2024/6/29/in-post-debate-poll-voters-think-biden-is-too-old-to-be-president-yet-alternative-candidates-perform-similarly-against-trump">Data for Progress (DFP) poll</a> that found Biden and Harris taking 45 percent of the vote against Trump, while various other Democrats — from Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg — won no higher than 44 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two problems with the argument that Biden’s polling isn’t so bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first is that Biden’s campaign is misrepresenting the available polling data. On the day of his debate with Trump, Biden trailed his Republican adversary by 0.2 percentage points in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a>. Today, the president trails Trump by 1.4 points. And some of the most recent surveys have been downright catastrophic: A <a href="https://x.com/ShaneGoldmacher/status/1807867916399804825">post-debate poll</a> of New Hampshire voters released Monday found Biden trailing Trump by 2 points. In December, Biden led Trump by <a href="https://www.anselm.edu/about/anselmian-hub/news/new-poll-saint-anselm-college-survey-center-finds-nikki-haley-clear-choice-voters-have-unfavorable-opinion-former-president-donald-trump">10 points in the same poll.</a> In 2020, he won the Granite State by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/state/new-hampshire">more than 7 points</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even the Biden campaign’s own handpicked public poll suggests that he is not the Democrats’ strongest candidate. Yes, the president received 45 percent support against Trump in DFP’s survey, while other hypothetical nominees secured slightly less. And yet, in some of those theoretical head-to-heads, Trump’s share of the vote also fell; whereas the Republican led Biden 48 to 45, he led Whitmer 46 to 44. In other words, the best poll the president could find showed him losing by a larger margin than the governor of Michigan — who has yet to introduce herself to the national electorate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2024/6/29/in-post-debate-poll-voters-think-biden-is-too-old-to-be-president-yet-alternative-candidates-perform-similarly-against-trump">that same poll</a> also showed that 1) 67 percent of Americans think Biden is too old to serve as president, 2) a majority of voters are more concerned about Biden’s age than Trump’s “criminal charges and threats to democracy,” and 3) Biden has a worse net approval rating than every single other Democrat included in the survey.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is true that, to this point, we haven’t seen massive erosion in Biden’s support since the debate. But it’s much too early to say that no such decline is forthcoming. The full impact of major news events can take a week or two to pervade the public’s consciousness. Even if Biden’s numbers hold roughly steady, however, that does not constitute a strong argument for his candidacy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After all, the president was losing before Thursday’s debate! Biden has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/upshot/introducing-2024-poll-tracker.html">trailing Trump</a> in polls of virtually every swing state for months. Before Thursday night, <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model">Nate Silver’s election forecast model</a> gave Trump a roughly two-thirds chance of winning. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s team pushed for an early showdown with Trump because they needed to change the race’s trajectory.&nbsp; The fact that Biden emerged from the debate in worse position than he had entered it — but maybe, only slightly worse — is not cause for comfort.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>2. “Elites may have been scandalized by Biden’s debate performance, but ordinary voters weren’t.”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some analysts have argued that the debate will not durably dent Biden’s numbers because the general public <em>already </em>believed that he was too old to competently serve. The hoarse, sputtering old man they saw Thursday night was exactly whom they already thought Biden to be. As the <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/hawk-tuah-and-the-zynternet">Substack columnist</a> Max Read puts the point, elite liberal commentators are panicked because “they might be the only people in the country to have <em>just now </em>realized that Biden is too old to be running for president. <a href="https://x.com/SteveKornacki/status/1806681534507659459">Most voters have known that he’s too old for months</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, the election analyst Lakshya Jain <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2024/06/30/the-case-for-and-against-joe-biden/">notes</a> that “<a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/706018390/Cbsnews-20240215-Econ-Biden#1fullscreen=1">in February</a>, 35% of registered voters believed that Biden had the mental and cognitive ability to serve as president.” In a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-debate-should-biden-be-running-mental-abilities/">post-debate survey</a> from the same pollster, that figure did fall to 27 percent. But this loss came almost entirely from partisan Democrats who will vote for Biden over Trump, anyway. Thus, one could argue that Biden’s incapacity to speak coherently off the cuff was already accounted for in his poll numbers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Read and Jain don’t think this constitutes a strong argument for Biden 2024. But the president and his team apparently do, dismissing his critics in the media as a <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/30/us-news/biden-campaign-rips-bedwetting-brigade-in-blast-touts-poll-pegging-him-stronger-than-other-dems/">“bedwetting brigade”</a> that’s out of touch with the electorate. As Garin, Biden’s pollster, argued Monday, “the president’s age was already priced into the decision-making process before the debate, and the debate itself did not cause any substantial reconsideration of the voters’ decision-making process.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, even ignoring the fact that Biden has lost support in the polls, the argument that “our candidate’s debate performance only generated a media consensus against his candidacy” is not reassuring. The media is a very powerful actor in American politics! Voters do not derive their impressions of candidates and parties from the ether; their understanding of the world is shaped by the editorial decisions of editors, reporters, and newscast producers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s say that two weeks from now Biden’s polls look no worse than they did before the debate. With that generous assumption, he would still be on track to lose the election. To gain the necessary ground, his campaign needs to shift the nation’s focus toward Trump’s vulnerabilities and Biden’s more favorable issues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s team struggled to do that before Thursday’s debate. Now, they need to find a way of doing so in the face of unrelenting media scrutiny of Biden’s age.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The past four days have already witnessed <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/biden-age-concerns-world-leaders-democrats-6d753921">a series</a> of <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/29/two-bidens-trump-debate-2024-president">leaks</a> from White House staffers and foreign officials detailing the president’s declining cognitive performance. Reporters love nothing more than an opaque scandal. They will spend the next four months digging up other anecdotes about Biden’s senescence, and giving headline coverage to his every campaign-trail misstatement or brain freeze. They will ask which Democrats knew that Biden was like this, and when. Picture Hillary Clinton’s email server scandal, only with actual stakes — not “but her emails” so much as “but his almost certain inability to effectively serve as president in 2028.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the problem extends beyond objective reporters. A wide array of liberal pundits (including myself) have declared that Biden lacks the communication skills necessary to be an effective presidential candidate (if not an effective president). It is possible to believe this while also considering Biden exponentially more fit for national leadership than Donald Trump. But that is not the easiest case to make to anyone who does not find Trump’s unique monstrosity self-evident — a group that includes all undecided voters by definition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality is that Biden — unlike more or less any other Democrat nominated in his place — will not be able to count on the full-throated support of his party’s most prominent allies in the media. Every case for his candidacy will either include a disclaimer acknowledging the legitimacy of concerns about his fitness, or else, be tainted by the absence of such acknowledgements.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The political elites stunned by Biden’s performance also include many of the Democratic Party’s most influential donors and activists. Some I’ve spoken with say that they feel gaslit and humiliated by the president’s showing, having previously vouched for his vitality when friends, family, and special counsel <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/3/12/24098577/robert-hur-testimony-report-biden-memory">Robert Hur called it into question</a>. They are now demoralized at the prospect of having to fundraise and organize for a candidate who they consider cognitively compromised and politically doomed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, as Republicans hammer down-ballot Democrats for <a href="https://x.com/davemccormickpa/status/1807441295826121165?s=46&amp;t=6pIOBuXCDYR3MDdqas9hTg">alleged complicity</a> in covering up Biden’s decline, many will likely feel compelled to distance themselves from the president and affirm voters’ fears about his competence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever polls show in the coming weeks, Biden’s candidacy now faces irrevocable challenges, which no other Democrat would confront.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>3. “Kamala is even more unpopular.”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most common and potent argument for Biden’s candidacy might be that Kamala Harris is the only realistic alternative and she is even less likely to defeat Trump than he is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first part of this claim is reasonable. I’m not certain that bypassing Harris would trigger a huge backlash among Black voters, <a href="https://x.com/lxeagle17/status/1755724546693538236">as many are wont to claim</a>. After all, Harris attracted so little support from Black Democrats during her first presidential run that she ended up dropping out before the South Carolina primary.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, passing over the first Black woman to serve as vice president would be a risky maneuver. And going with anyone besides Harris would create myriad logistical problems. Only Biden’s running mate would have immediate access to his campaign funds, for one thing. Thus, it seems more likely than not that Harris would be the nominee if Biden dropped out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the idea that Harris is a worse candidate than today’s version of Biden lacks support. Voters disapprove of <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">Biden by an 18.4-point margin</a>, while <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">disapproving of Harris</a> by only 10. And since she is less well-known to the public, it is more plausible that she can change voters’ perceptions of her than that Biden can.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, Harris is more capable of running as a “normal” candidate, one whose liabilities are sufficiently ordinary to keep attention focused on Trump. Her nomination would also flip the valence of the age issue, enabling Democrats to hammer Trump’s own declining lucidity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris is no one’s idea of an optimal candidate. Her electoral track record is lackluster. But, unlike Biden, she’s not regarded as too old for the presidency by a majority of Americans.&nbsp; She can be an awkward speaker at times, but never so incoherent as her boss now is. And she offers voters an alternative to the Trump-Biden binary they’ve long been discontented with.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s not a great option. But she has a better shot of changing the race’s menacing trajectory than Biden does.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>4) “Biden stepping down would be undemocratic.”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/01/biden-2024-election-pr-campaign-step-aside">Axios</a> reports, one of the Biden campaign’s “biggest arguments” against a new nominee “will be that Biden won the Democratic primaries overwhelmingly, and that result is final.” One source close to Biden told the publication, “You guys don’t get to decide. That’s not how this works. We don’t have smoke-filled rooms.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the idea that Biden stepping down would constitute an affront to (small-d) democratic principles does not withstand scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/11/us/politics/biden-approval-polling-2024.html">2022</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/09/07/poll-biden-2024-second-term-democrat-voters-cnn">2023</a>, polls repeatedly showed around two-thirds of Democratic voters wanted a nominee other than Joe Biden. In at least <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/analysis/biden-trump-debate-poll-june-2024">one post-debate survey</a>, more Democratic voters supported Biden dropping out than opposed him doing so, even this late in the game. These polls represent the views of a much larger body of Democrats than the small minority who turned out for uncompetitive primary elections this year. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, were the Democratic Party to somehow rewrite the rules of his nominating procedures to oust Biden, that would violate democratic principles. But no one is suggesting anything like that. The decision is ultimately Biden’s alone. If he wants to base that decision on what’s best for democracy, however, then he must do whatever would give his party the best chance of keeping an authoritarian demagogue out of power.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>5) “Biden’s exit would lead to chaos.”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the New Yorker, Jay Caspian Kang <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/fault-lines/the-case-for-joe-biden-staying-in-the-race">argues</a> (somewhat tentatively) that Biden should stay in the race, as “the known bad candidate is better than the chaos of the unknown.” He notes that Biden’s exit could lead to a “potentially toxic battle for the candidacy” at a disorderly Democratic convention. Given that one of Trump’s chief liabilities is his association with chaos, better for Democrats to project an image of stability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a reasonable view. Without question, all of the Democratic Party’s available options are freighted with risk. But staying the course is nevertheless the least promising play.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As already noted, Biden is losing and is ill-equipped to catch up to Trump, as he’s saddled with a unique incapacity to communicate effectively off the cuff or persuade the press that he is physically capable of serving four years. And he is also personally identified with the highest inflation of the past four decades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea that the safest bet is to stick with a nominee whom more than <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poll-debate-should-biden-be-running-mental-abilities/">70 percent</a> of the country deems unfit to run for president is founded on little beyond status-quo bias. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, Biden’s belated exit from the race would invite some disorder. But if he were to immediately endorse Harris, it seems likely that the party would coalesce behind her rapidly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Were Biden to drop out — and advise his party to settle on a replacement through deliberation at its convention — then matters would get rather chaotic. But there would also be significant upsides to such a scenario, which Biden’s defenders have given short shrift.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An open convention almost certainly guarantees <em>much</em> higher ratings than an ordinary one would receive. Yes, this might mean that a massive, national audience might be exposed to bitter Democratic infighting. But competent producers and stage managers could also ensure that that audience sees a great deal of anti-Trump propaganda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, there are potential strategic benefits to springing a mystery nominee on the GOP in late August. A “generic Democrat” tends to perform much better in polls than any particular Democratic politician. Giving Republicans less than three months to define the Democratic nominee — and dent his or her “generic” status — might be advantageous. In the interim, it might be easier to portray the election as a referendum on Trump if he is the only major party candidate during the next two months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, I’m not sure that the hypothetical benefits of a completely open convention outweigh the hazards. The best of the party’s bad options might be to rally around Harris as quickly as possible, her vulnerabilities as a candidate notwithstanding.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But sticking with the known over the unknown — when the former is a nominee severely compromised by old age — is not prudent. There are risks to replacing Biden, but also, potentially large upsides. The same cannot be said of running a candidate whom a large and growing majority of voters consider unfit to serve.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps, this reality is best conveyed through a hypothetical: Imagine that Donald Trump was trailing Biden in virtually every swing state and had just appeared senile at the first presidential debate. In that world, how would Democrats feel if they woke up to learn that Trump was voluntarily stepping down and that the Republican National Convention would be nominating a new candidate (who could be certain of Trump’s unequivocal support)? Would they consider themselves fortunate to no longer be running against a historically unpopular candidate who was oratorically incompetent and on track to lose, since now the GOP was going to look chaotic? Or might they be more afraid of an unknown, more generic Republican than they were of the much-disliked, elderly guy they were already beating?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It seems clear to me that Democrats would not be happy to see Trump step down in that scenario. In any case, according to reports, Republicans <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-campaign-email-details-how-defend-presidents-debate-performance">are privately fretting</a> about the possibility that Biden will hang it up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricane season has begun, and it’s off to a frightening start.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday night, Beryl, the first named hurricane of the year,&nbsp;strengthened into a dangerous Category 5 storm as it moved northwest towards Jamaica.<strong> </strong>Earlier in the week, it pummeled islands in the southeast Caribbean,<strong> </strong>including St. Vincent and the Grenadines,<strong> </strong>destroying homes and leaving at least one person dead.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The storm, which <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPAT2+shtml/020855.shtml?">is expected</a> to weaken later on Tuesday, is already record-breaking. Beryl is the earliest Category 5 storm on record in the Atlantic. It also intensified at record speeds for a storm this early in the year, jumping from Category 1 to Category 4 in less than 24 hours.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caribbean nations are particularly vulnerable to hurricanes, for the obvious reason that they&#8217;re often in the path of these storms. Hurricanes typically form in the Atlantic Ocean, west of northern Africa, and then travel west toward the Caribbean and Southeastern US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Caribbean islands also have one of the world’s best defense systems against superstorms like Beryl. That system is hidden under the waves, it’s free, and it’s all-natural. It’s coral reefs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, most Caribbean nations are surrounded by a colorful patchwork of coral reefs, communities of living animals that function together as natural seawalls. These hard, rocklike creatures help dampen waves and reduce flooding. Research shows that coral reefs help dozens of countries avert billions of dollars in flood damage each year, in the Caribbean and globally.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem, more pressing now than ever, is that these lifesaving ecosystems are vanishing —&nbsp;for the very same reason hurricanes are becoming more destructive.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">An all-natural hurricane defense system&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Each piece of coral on a reef is actually a colony of tiny animals, called polyps. Those polyps build skeletons out of calcium carbonate, not unlike a snail growing a shell, that form the structure of the reef.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s these coral skeletons that safeguard coastlines during a storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Simply put, waves lose energy when they ram into coral reefs. The bigger and taller the reef, the more wave energy it dissipates, for the same reason that coastal cities use breakwaters made of rocks to protect the shoreline. Remarkably, studies show that coral reefs can dissipate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4794">more than 90 percent</a> of wave energy. Waves with less energy are smaller and slower and don’t deal as much damage when they reach the shore.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even a small difference in a reef’s height can make a big difference in risk. Flood risk is often measured by what’s called the 100-year flood zone — an area in which the chance of a flood in a given year is 1 percent. If coral reefs in the US lose 1 meter of height, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/value-us-coral-reefs-risk-reduction">a study</a> found, that zone in the US would grow by 104 square kilometers (or about 26,000 acres, nearly twice the size of Manhattan), putting about 51,000 more people at risk of flooding.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1491221549.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.041829306103,100,69.916341387793" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">This service —&nbsp;which coral reefs supply for free —&nbsp;is worth a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the US, including Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, coral reefs help safeguard the homes of more than 18,000 people and avert $1.8 billion in flood damage each year, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/pcmsc/value-us-coral-reefs-risk-reduction">according</a> to a 2019 study by the US Geological Survey (USGS). Slightly <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5997709/">older research</a> found that, globally, this number is more than $4 billion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Without reefs, annual damages would more than double,” authors of the latter study, published in <em>Nature Communications, </em>wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caribbean nations are among those that benefit most from coral reefs and the damage they prevent. In the <em>Nature Communications </em>study, published in 2018, researchers ranked countries by how much flood damage coral reefs avert, relative to their GDP. Eight of the top 10 are Caribbean nations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No. 3 is Grenada,&nbsp;where Hurricane Beryl made landfall Monday.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Vanishing reefs</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the financial and potentially life-saving benefits reefs provide make losing them that much scarier. And we are indeed losing them, especially in the Caribbean’s warm(ing) waters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The area of live hard corals on Caribbean reefs has fallen by about <a href="https://www.epa.gov/coral-reefs/us-coral-reefs">80 percent</a> in recent decades. In some regions, like the Florida Keys, the declines are <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23868423/florida-coral-reef-bleaching-heat-wave-climate-change">even steeper</a>.&nbsp;Compared to the 1970s, most Caribbean reefs are <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24137250/coral-reefs-bleaching-climate-change">almost unrecognizable today</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elkhorn coral — a species resembling moose antlers known for its wave-weakening abilities  —&nbsp;is especially endangered. In the 1970s, it grew across more than 30 percent of Caribbean reefs. By the 1980s, coverage of the coral had fallen to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37858-2">less than 2 percent</a>, a number that has likely only shrunk further in the years since.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A number of human behaviors have destroyed Caribbean coral, from coastal construction to fishing, as have some seemingly natural threats, like disease. The most enduring and existential problem, however, is climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warming ocean water disrupts the relationship between coral and a kind of symbiotic algae that lives inside the polyps. This disruption causes coral to turn white —&nbsp;or “bleach” —&nbsp;and starve. Bleached corals often have more trouble surviving other threats and die.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means climate change is not only making tropical storms more severe, but it can also weaken our natural defenses against them.&nbsp;And this is an important, frightening point: A warming ocean makes storms more dangerous, not just because they’re intensifying faster or dropping more rain but because, in places like the Caribbean, we’re losing resilience that iconic ecosystems provide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re looking for electoral suspense, don’t look across the pond. Barring a polling error of world historic proportions, 14 years of Conservative rule will come to an end in the United Kingdom on July 4. The question isn’t whether Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s party will lose, it’s whether anything will be left of them the day after.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just five years after the Conservatives won their <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2019-50765773">own historic landslide</a>, pollsters are warning that the party faces “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-polls-point-electoral-extinction-prime-minister-sunaks-conservatives-2024-06-15/">electoral extinction</a>.” The current <a href="https://www.economist.com/interactive/uk-general-election/forecast">forecast from the Economist</a> predicts the opposition Labour Party will win around 431 seats in the 650 seat parliament, up from the 205 they currently hold. That would be the center-left party’s biggest majority of the post-war era, eclipsing the landslide 1997 election, when the Tony Blair-led party trounced John Major’s Conservatives, ending a 18-year period of Tory dominance. The Conservatives, meanwhile, are projected to fall from 344 seats to just 109. Constituencies that have been loyal Tory bastions for decades <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/london-essex-red-elections-uk-2024-conservative-working-class-liz-truss-pledge/">are in play</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The party is likely in for a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-general-election-conservative-party-tories-rishi-sunak-successor/">brutal internal</a> battle over its future, with some right-wingers calling for a merger with Trumpian gadfly Nigel Farage’s right-wing Reform UK party. Some polls suggest Sunak might become the first ever sitting prime minister to <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2024/06/19/rishi-sunak-to-lose-seat-tory-wipeout-major-poll-predicts/">lose his own seat</a>. (Though he fortunately <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/19/rishi-sunak-california-00164050">has a $7.2 million mansion</a> in Santa Monica, California to fall back on, which presumably has many seats.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Conservatives ended up on the brink of a historic loss the way Hemmingway described going bankrupt: Gradually, and then suddenly. The Tories have been underwater in the polls <a href="https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/">since late 2021</a>, but Sunak only <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/uk/uk-early-elections-sunak-conservatives-intl/index.html">called this election in late May</a>, likely sensing his party’s prospects were not likely to improve any time soon. That’s a swift, though not exactly painless, end to a political era that radically changed a country and its place in the world. The consensus view is that it has not changed for the better.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/conservative-effect-20102024/29642F14C9265B69EEC9283AFD3FF9E6">forthcoming book</a>, <em>The Conservative Effect, 2010–2024: 14 Wasted Years?</em>, co-edited by Anthony Seldon, a veteran chronicler and biographer of contemporary British prime ministers, attempts to take stock of the legacy of this period. Seldon is unsparing in his concluding essay, writing, “By 2024, Britain’s standing in the world was lower [compared to 2010], the union was less strong, the country less equal, the population less well protected, growth more sluggish with the outlook poor.” He concludes: “Overall, it is hard to find a comparable period in history of the Conservatives which achieved so little, or which left the country at its conclusion in a more troubling state.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how, exactly, did we get here?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">14 years, five prime ministers, one Brexit</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This 14 year period of Conservative rule is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6e670e62-57a0-404b-a0a1-66cc5b98ee57">really two different periods</a>: pre- and post-Brexit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first period began in 2010, when Prime Minister David Cameron, leading a coalition government consisting of the Conservatives and the centrist Liberal Democrats, moved into 10 Downing Street, ending 13 years of Labour rule under Tony Blair and his dour successor Gordon Brown. Relatively youthful at 44, Cameron, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/dec/18/conservatives.interviews">self-described “liberal conservative,”</a> distinguished himself from previous generations of conservatives with stances like his support for <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-22605011">gay marriage</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/14/cameron-wants-greenest-government-ever">calls for action on climate change</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But his&nbsp; economic policies were anything but moderate. Cameron’s government came into office in the wake of the global financial <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/cameron-uk-deficit-even-worse-than-we-thought">crisis facing a budget deficit</a> of some $225 billion. In response, the government <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/04/01/what-have-fourteen-years-of-conservative-rule-done-to-britain">carried out a program</a> of fiscal consolidation and budget cuts that the UK budget office has described as “one of the biggest deficit reduction programs seen in any advanced economy since World War II.” Public spending fell from around 41 percent of GDP to 35 percent, with deep cuts to social programs, infrastructure and international diplomacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Heading into the 2015 election, Cameron was also coming under pressure from the insurgent UK Independence Party, led by Farage, and from his own party’s right-flank, to hold a referendum on whether the UK should remain a member of the European Union. Though Cameron personally opposed withdrawing from the EU, in part to respond to dissidents from his right <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-21148282">he vowed</a> that if he won, he would attempt to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU and then hold an “in/out referendum” on whether Britain should stay.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a short-term political move, it worked out great. The Conservatives won an overall majority in 2015, ending the coalition era. But <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/brexit-european-union-chaos-brief-guide-how.html">Cameron was less successful</a> in convincing Brussels to give Britain “special status” within the EU. Cameron won only minor concessions on sovereignty and immigration. There has always been an undercurrent of Euro-skepticism in British politics, but it grew stronger in the 2000s and 2010s. The financial crisis of 2008 and the eurozone debt crisis that followed undermined the appeal of the EU as an economic union. The unprecedented number of migrants who attempted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/21/8462219/europe-migrant-mediterranean-drowning">reach Europe in 2015</a> reduced support for the EU’s open border policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In retrospect, it was a perfect storm for Brexit, but it was still stunning when the country voted 52 to 48 percent in 2016 to leave the EU. Cameron, who had campaigned for the “Remain” side, resigned as prime minister. He was replaced by Theresa May, previously the home secretary and a fellow Remainer, who had the unenviable task of negotiating Britain’s withdrawal from the EU while simultaneously presiding over a <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/03/brexit-european-union-chaos-brief-guide-how.html">civil war within her own party</a> over how exactly Brexit should be implemented.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moderates wanted a “soft Brexit” that would preserve Britain’s access to Europe’s common market. Hardliners wanted a “hard Brexit” that would prioritize ditching EU regulations and controlling immigration. European negotiators in Brussels were not going to let the Brits have both. Further complicating the process was an issue that few anticipated before the referendum: the economic and political status of Northern Ireland — the only part of the UK with a land border with the EU. Finding a way to avoid a hard border across the island of Ireland — a key pillar of the Northern Irish peace process — while also removing the UK as a whole from the EU turned out to be excruciatingly difficult.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">May stepped down in 2019, and after an internal party leadership election, was replaced by former London mayor and omnipresent media figure Boris Johnson. Johnson is not exactly known for holding consistent views.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2014/11/boris-johnson-london-s-mayor-on-why-he-wrote-a-book-about-winston-churchill.html">2014 interview for Slate</a>, two years before the Brexit vote, he told me that when it came to the EU, “We may want to change our relationship a bit, but fundamentally we will remain within the European common market.” Just a few years later, he would be one of the most visible and enthusiastic campaigners for “Leave.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few months after taking office, Johnson called a national election, campaigning on a pledge to “get Brexit done” — and won a landslide victory. It didn’t hurt that Labour at the time was led by the veteran left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, who had both failed to take a strong stance on Brexit and was beset by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-45030552">accusations of anti-semitism</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Armed with his new large majority, Johnson did something unusual for him: He did what he said he would do, and indeed got Brexit done. Britain formally left the EU on January 31, 2020. Just two years later, however, Johnson left as well, forced to resign over a scandal over allegations that he misled parliament <a href="https://apnews.com/article/boris-johnson-resignation-60da3c4b29a4e9c93c7db9f53034ad0e">over parties held in his office</a> during Covid-19 lockdowns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was followed by the 50-day reign of Prime Minister Liz Truss, which was the shortest in British history — so short, in fact, that she was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/world/europe/liz-truss-lettuce-stream.html">famously outlasted by a head of lettuce</a>.&nbsp; Truss is <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66897881">mainly remembered</a> for a proposed set of tax cuts so extreme it triggered weeks of panic in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66897881">global bond markets</a> and the kind of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63051702">upbraiding from the IMF</a> normally reserved for failed states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Truss was then replaced by Sunak, who made history as the first prime minister of Asian descent, as well as <a href="https://www.oldest.org/politics/youngest-prime-ministers/">the youngest one since William Pitt</a> (the Younger, of course) in 1783. Under Sunak, the lingering effects of the pandemic and the shock to energy markets caused by the war in Ukraine have contributed to a cost-of-living crisis that has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/uk-energy-prices-warm-hubs-84dc6878fd3c5b91837f8d3558c1f672">disproportionately impacted the poorest Britons</a>. Sunak has tried to make the case that the UK economy is turning the corner — and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jun/19/inflation-rishi-sunak-analysis">indeed inflation is now starting to ease</a> — but it’s almost certainly too little too late.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The aftermath</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To some extent, Sunak’s biggest crime is simply to be in office during a widespread anti-incumbent trend throughout the Western democratic world. He’s deeply unpopular, but <a href="https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval">not significantly more so</a> than G7 counterparts like France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Defenders of the Conservatives’ time in office will point to the external shocks the party had to contend with, including the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid pandemic, and the economic impact of the war in Ukraine. But every major economy had to deal with those shocks. Only one country — and one party — chose Brexit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disentangling the effects of the withdrawal from other post-2020 shocks isn’t easy, but a recent study from Britain’s National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR), an independent think tank, <a href="https://www.niesr.ac.uk/publications/revisiting-effect-brexit?type=global-economic-outlook-topical-feature">estimated</a> that the UK’s real GDP is about 2 to 3 percent lower today, compared to a scenario where it stayed in the union. Real income is about 8 to 9 percent lower.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn02784/">government’s own figures</a>, Britain’s GDP today is only about 1.7 percent higher than it was pre-pandemic, compared to 3.7 percent for the Eurozone and 8.7 percent for the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ironically, Brexit didn’t even accomplish the goal that motivated many of its supporters to vote for it: Net migration to the UK <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/three-years-after-britain-left-eu-net-migration-never-been-higher-brexit/">has actually increased</a> since the withdrawal. Much of the debate around immigration policy has focused on the government’s bizarre and inhumane plan to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-61782866">fly asylum seekers to Rwanda</a> to have their claims processed, as a means of deterring them from trying. But asylum seekers are <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01403/SN01403.pdf">only about 11 percent of the UK’s immigrants</a>, and half of those are Ukrainians who entered under a specially tailored system and significantly more public support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The real driver of migration is economic — including the economic needs of Britain itself. As migration researcher Hein de Haas <a href="https://www.bigissue.com/opinion/brexit-net-migration-rishi-sunak-uk-immigration/">has written</a>, while “Brexit successfully curtailed free inflows of EU workers, it did not eliminate labor shortages that had been driving increasing migration to the UK ever since the 1990s.” Some jobs staffing Britain’s stores and its much-beloved National Health Service have been filled by non-EU migrants instead of European ones; some European migrants who previously traveled back and forth between the UK and the continent have stayed put.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Brexit’s advocates had argued that the benefits of trade with Europe could be offset by a free trade agreement that a new “global Britain,” unshackled from the EU, could pursue. But other than new deals with Australia and New Zealand, <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9314/">progress has been slow on that front</a>. Johnson and Truss both promised a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/21/britains-hopes-of-early-post-brexit-trade-deal-with-us-appear-dashed">new free trade deal</a> with the United States as a benefit of Brexit, but badly <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8f229e15-9842-46ce-a828-19647a48f6d6">misjudged the changing mood in Washington</a>, where both the Republicans and Democrats have taken a turn toward protectionism. (Credit where it’s due: Johnson did get the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-58654045">US to lift a ban</a> on the imports of British lamb.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than 60 percent of British voters, including more than a third of “Leave” voters, now say Brexit has been <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/politics/articles/45733-most-britons-say-brexit-has-been-more-failure">more of a failure than a success</a>. But the damage is done.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Not-so-global Britain</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality is that far from broadening Britain’s horizons, Brexit has forced it to confront what it really is: a mid-sized country with a mid-sized economy that has a mid-sized influence on the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Asked what role foreign policy and national security have played in this election, Nick Witney, a former British diplomat and defense official now with the European Council on Foreign Relations, told Vox, “Not much, because&nbsp; we don&#8217;t have much of a foreign or defense policy at the moment. And there&#8217;s going to be no money available to buy ourselves one for a number of years under new government.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, for all Johnson’s <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3de0d68a-9df9-11e7-8cd4-932067fbf946">talk</a> of a “global Britain” recovering its “buccaneering” spirit, the UK cuts a more modest profile on the world stage today than it did when Conservatives took over. London has cut funding to the <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/the-incredible-shrinking-global-britain/">foreign office</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/25/boris-johnson-likes-tout-global-britain-he-may-be-its-biggest-enemy/">foreign aid</a>, and one of the country’s most significant soft power assets: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/dec/03/rishi-sunak-says-bbc-cuts-welcome-cost-of-living-crisis">the BBC</a>. Defense spending<a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2024/04/the-uk-is-boosting-defence-spending-but-will-it-boost.html"> has increased</a> since Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine but the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-army-armed-forces-ukraine-b2482059.html">size of the military in terms of manpower</a> has shrunk. A last-ditch <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/355547/soldiers-shortage-demographics-population-conscription">campaign proposal by Sunak</a> to mandate national service for 18-year-olds did not go over well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No one talks about ‘global Britain’ anymore,” said Witney. “It’s extraordinary how our horizons have shrunk. If you go back 20 years, there was practically not a sparrow that fell anywhere around the globe where the British didn&#8217;t feel they would have something to say about it. Nowadays, we are an impoverished and ultimately less ambitious country.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One very notable exception has been the war in Ukraine, where the UK has been a significant provider of military aid, training, and economic support — often taking a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-us-and-uk-are-split-on-the-ukraine-war-weapons-russia-oligarchs-churchill-8540ef60">more aggressive stance</a> than the US on providing new weapons systems and capabilities to the Ukrainians. Johnson may be persona non grata in British politics right now, but there are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-town-names-street-after-boris-johnson-2022-5">streets named after him in Ukraine</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Probably due in part to the fact that the result hasn’t really been in doubt, the election itself has been heavily dominated by gaffes and scandals, including Sunak’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jun/07/rishi-sunak-d-day-blunder-uk-election#:~:text=Britain's%20clearly%20wounded%20prime%20minister,at%20the%20American%20cemetery%20off">ill-advised decision</a> to leave D-Day commemorations in France early and the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/27/why-are-uk-politicians-in-trouble-for-placing-bets-on-election-date">revelations</a> that candidates in both parties have been betting on the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also true that compared to figures like Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, or even David Cameron — all of whom came into power in landscape-shifting change elections — current Labour leader Keir Starmer isn’t exactly promising radical change. Starmer has managed to stabilize his party after the politically disastrous Corbyn years, and — perhaps not surprisingly given that he entered the race with a huge lead — has run on a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyxx1lq50nlo">relatively modest policy platform</a>. It’s too modest for some allies, who accuse of him of “<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/keir-starmers-labour-has-been-too-timid-and-must-not-settle-for-limping-into-no-10-says-unites-sharon-graham-12979396">limping into No. 10</a>,”&nbsp; while the party has also <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/uk-election-starmer-labour-party-accused-purging-left-wing-candidates-rcna154624">angered progressives</a> by barring several left-wing candidates, including two women of color, in the run-up to the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the party opposed Brexit during the referendum, Labour <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/266d8501-1c60-4afa-963b-c82757b5e3da">does not plan to try to rejoin the European Union</a>. Ahmet Kaya, an economist with the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told Vox that wouldn’t really be practical in the near term anyway, and that the focus should be on negotiations with Europe aimed at “reducing the barriers on trade and facilitating some of the free movement of people,” particularly students. Steps like these, he said, could “reduce the overall negative impact of Brexit.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s won’t be a huge shift on foreign policy either. Unlike in the US, support for Ukraine is pretty bipartisan in the UK. In the wake of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Sergei_and_Yulia_Skripal">poisoning of a former Russian spy</a> and his daughter on British soil in 2018 as well a flurry of coverage of how Russian oligarchs have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-62410715">manipulated the British financial system</a>, there’s little pro-Russian sympathy in the UK, though Farage recently <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722pn07w99o">caused a media uproar</a> with remarks suggesting NATO was partly to blame for the invasion of Ukraine. Starmer has also <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-67213191">taken some criticism</a> from Muslim Labour supporters over being slow to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. This hasn’t mattered much for his election chances, but his choices on this and other contentious issues are going to get a lot tougher when he’s actually in power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Above all else, Starmer will face the challenge of overcoming the perceptions built up during the past decade. “Brexit has kind of defined how the UK is perceived internationally by many of our partners,” Evie Aspinall, director of the British Foreign Policy Group, told Vox. “We’re seen as a more isolated nation than we were prior to Brexit.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are some parallels here with the Biden administration, which came into office promising allies that “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/02/04/remarks-by-president-biden-on-americas-place-in-the-world/">America is back</a>” following the isolation of the Trump years. As with the Democrats in 2020, Labour has gone with a broadly popular — if somewhat dull — candidate, whose promise is that he can turn down the political temperature after a period of chaos and upheaval. It may not be enough to get them another 13 or 14 year stint in power, but it’s almost certainly enough to turn the page on July 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s undeniable: the era of Chappell Roan is upon us. At music festivals and on the lists forecasting <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/chappell-roan-5-things-know-090855914.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEefUpnkTaIJpRuEbR6dE8g5e8t3nu9bxSbG-mFk3deSmqQseg2Xmsg51irNEqZ3m3ocr0VrQCUQ5pmmLthbiscRQAPsECNMFwIwcpklVdeo-dS_3mOVBmbh0PJ6i8XuouS6Ft8w8qPXFF3zbm0RKAMXGEpx0cZJyXZ70EIFkZk5">pop’s</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin">next</a> <a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/chappell-roan-big-year-interview-coachella-performance">big</a> <a href="https://industryme.co.uk/born-this-way-the-rise-of-chappell-roan/">thing</a>, there she is: big red hair and big powerhouse voice, unapologetically queer lyrics and exuberant drag queen aesthetic. This is the summer Chappell Roan became impossible to ignore. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan has been a working pop artist for years. Now 26, she signed her first record deal with Atlantic Records at 17 and has been putting out songs ever since — but for a long time, none of them seemed to quite hit. Last September, though, Roan released her first full album, <em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</em>, and set off on tour as Olivia Rodrigo’s opener. In March, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4WiXKGCJhg">her appearance on NPR’s Tiny Desk Concert series</a> went surprisingly viral (3.4 million views and counting), sending her <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/sabrina-carpenter-chappell-roan-are-pop-stars-in-the-making-how-opening-tour-gigs-tiktok-and-coachella-are-keys-to-their-success-215444839.html">Spotify monthly listeners count</a> rocketing up by 500 percent. In April, she became one of the <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/music-features/coachella-2024-review-best-acts-3618348">biggest stories out of Coachella</a>. In June, she was the story of the <a href="https://people.com/chappell-roan-dresses-as-statue-of-liberty-governors-ball-statement-about-freedom-8660637">Governor’s Ball</a>. She’s been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L94zTNhLnXo">on Jimmy Fallon</a>. She’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOg93THAyE0">performed on <em>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</em></a>. She is currently in the process of crossing the border that separates “working pop artist” and “pop star.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that makes Roan’s story so compelling is how long it took her to get here and what a strikingly different artist and performer she was at the beginning of the journey. Today, a Chappell Roan show plays like a joyous drag ball. A few years ago, Roan was making broody Lorde-meets-Florence Welch power ballads about suffering deliciously for the love of a boy. She pitched her voice deep and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkyqkv/cursive-singing-tiktok-trend-explained">sang her lyrics in smooth, diphthonged cursive</a>. In her videos, she wore her hair dark and straight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan’s trajectory from there to here reveals a lot about why, exactly, she’s taking off so precipitously right now. It’s the story of coming of age, both artistically and personally, at exactly the right time and place. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How Kayleigh became Chappell</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan grew up with the name Kayleigh Amstutz. She lived in what she sometimes describes as a <a href="https://www.polyesterzine.com/features/chappell-roan-audience-participation-playing-a-character-and-being-horny">trailer park</a> in Willard, Missouri, <a href="https://data.census.gov/profile/Willard_city,_Missouri?g=160XX00US2979882">population 6,000</a>. Her childhood was deeply conservative. She went to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin">church three times a week</a>, she said in an interview with the Guardian, and was taught that “being gay was bad and a sin.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I wish it was better. I wish I had better things to say,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">she told Rolling Stone</a> in 2022. “But mentally, I had a really tough time.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her family and peers found out she could sing when they heard her in a middle school talent show, and she signed to Atlantic Records after she was scouted posting songs to YouTube. Flying back and forth between her parents’ home in Missouri and studios in LA and New York, she got to work. She released her first single, “Good Hurt,” in August 2017, and her first EP <em>School Nights</em> a month later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Already, she had decided that she would not be performing as Kayleigh Amstutz. Instead, <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/entertainment/2017/08/17/chappell-roan-singer-willard-she-just-made-big-time/548315001/">she created a stage name</a> in honor of her grandfather, Dennis Chappell, and his favorite song, “The Strawberry Roan.” </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>A few years ago, Roan was making broody Lorde-meets-Florence Welch power ballads about suffering deliciously for the love of a boy</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;The picking of the name was the hardest part of this entire thing,&#8221; <a href="https://www.news-leader.com/story/entertainment/2017/08/17/chappell-roan-singer-willard-she-just-made-big-time/548315001/">Roan confided in her hometown newspaper</a>, The Springfield News-Leader, in the lead-up to releasing <em>School Nights</em> in 2017. &#8220;It was the most stressful part.&#8221; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few years later, Roan had a different perspective on this part of her life. All of it seemed strange to her, stressful in its own way. “I felt very unprepared,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">she told Rolling Stone</a>. “I didn’t know the consequences of how much I had to sacrifice. I didn’t do my senior year. I didn’t go to prom. I didn’t go to graduation. I missed a lot of what would have been the end of my childhood to do this job.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, the job was to sing dark, moody songs about the sadomasochistic thrill of being in love with a bad boy. “No one else compares to who I had first,” Roan sings in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmEWNgO0F9k">Good Hurt</a>” as she submerges herself somberly in a lake of black water in the accompanying video. “All I really want is a good hurt.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan of this era was a markedly different performer from the Roan we know now. There was no hint of queerness in her presentation yet, with her songs addressed mainly to an unnamed “<a href="https://genius.com/Chappell-roan-sugar-high-lyrics">beautiful boy</a>.” With her long hair worn dark and straight, she gave off a witchy aura, an impression she magnified by gliding around in long white gowns — a far cry from the gleefully tacky drag get-ups she wears now. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps most striking of all, the aesthetic Roan used in the 2010s doesn’t feel like one particular to her. She was doing a variation of the melancholy indie pop sound and look that was then in vogue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467">Roan now describes her sound of this era as</a> “really dark, angsty pop that was pretty boring.” Her magnetic presence and vocal chops were enough to garner her a small and fervent fanbase, but it wasn’t yet a group large enough to reach critical mass.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everything changed, Roan has said in interviews, when she left Missouri to live full time in Los Angeles on her own in 2018. For the first time, she was able to separate herself from the conservative ideology of her childhood.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I was told this city is demonic and Satanists live here,” <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467">Roan told NME this February</a>. “But when I got to West Hollywood, it opened my eyes [to the fact] that everything I was afraid of wasn’t always true — especially [what I’d been told] about the queer community. Going to gay clubs for the first time, it felt spiritual.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was also in LA that Roan met the man who would become her primary creative collaborator: Dan Nigro, a music producer and former indie frontman. He and Roan  began collaborating just a few months before Nigro broke out in a huge way for his work on Olivia Rodrigo’s “Driver’s License.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first collaboration Nigro and Roan released together was “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR3Liudev18">Pink Pony Club</a>,” which dropped in April 2020. There, we start to see the beginning of what we now know as Chappell Roan: hair worn loose and curly, vulnerability pushed forward but shame exuberantly chased away.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Pink Pony Club” is a story song Roan has said was inspired by her first trip to the Abbey, an institution in LA’s gay nightlife scene. She was transfixed by the go-go dancers, and so she wrote a song about a woman from a small town who leaves her scandalized mother behind to become a stripper at the Pink Pony Club. Roan had sung all her previous songs in the deep indie girl slur that was popular at the time, but she does “Pink Pony Club” in a voice so precise it starts to feel like a burlesque.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“<em>God</em>, what have you <em>done</em>?” wails the narrator’s mother in the chorus, with Roan coming down hard on the d’s and the t’s, her falsetto bright and airy. “Oh mama, I&#8217;m just having fun,” the narrator responds, and although the song is in a minor key, Roan’s voice is joyous: “On the stage in my heels, it&#8217;s where I belong.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately for Roan, April 2020 was not a time that welcomed raucous odes to the dance club. When “Pink Pony Club” dropped into the traumatic early days of the pandemic, it sank like a stone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The song was also <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/the-cover/the-cover-chapell-roan-interview-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-midwest-princess-3582467">unpopular at her label</a>, which disapproved of Roan turning her back so abruptly on the aesthetic she’d begun to craft in <em>School Nights</em>. Roan released only two more songs with Atlantic: the light love ballad “<a href="https://youtu.be/0SfI95-XIqU?si=xYK-CHWLXetEukRD">Love Me Anyway</a>” and the melancholy “<a href="https://youtu.be/GcXlN7meclE?si=7xSlEVN8IHIbaeCy">California</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“California” is a sort of response to and inverse of “Pink Pony Club.” Like its predecessor, it tells the story of a dreamer who left her small town for a love of delicious sin in LA. Unlike the main character in “Pink Pony Club,” the narrator of “California” feels increasingly like she’s failed by coming to the city and that everything she’s sacrificed has been for nothing. “Won’t make my mama proud,” Roan sings with mounting excitement in “Pink Pony Club.” “I let you down,” she sings on a down note in “California.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ten days after “California” was released, in August 2020, Atlantic officially dropped Roan from the label. Her music, they said, was underperforming. The same week, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">her relationship with the man she’d been seeing for four and a half years ended</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Midwest princess rises</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I felt like a failure, but I knew deep down I wasn’t,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/dec/29/chappell-roan-pops-next-big-thing-i-grew-up-thinking-being-gay-was-a-sin">Roan told the Guardian in 2023</a>. She moved back home to Willard, Missouri, got a job working the drive-thru window at a coffee kiosk, and plotted her next move. She wanted to give herself time to recalibrate and save money before going back to LA and trying music again. She would give herself a year there to make it before giving in and enrolling in college. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, little by little, Roan was beginning to develop a cult following, without any official backing from the music industry. “Pink Pony Club” was becoming a bona fide sleeper hit as it took off across TikTok and through word of mouth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Here’s a totally reasonable proposal for song of summer 2021: a single that dropped more than a full year ago, in April 2020, to essentially no fanfare, by a 21-year-old singer-songwriter who hasn’t even cracked 4,000 followers on Twitter,” <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/song-recommendation-chappell-roan-pink-pony-club.html">announced Vulture in 2021</a>, describing “Pink Pony Club” as “a pop hit from an alternate timeline that somehow ended up in ours by accident.” The song wasn’t charting yet, not even close, but it was starting to get attention in all the right places.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Nigro had been helping Olivia Rodrigo craft and release her hit debut studio album, <em>Sour.</em> In November 2021, with Rodrigo launched, Nigro and Roan reunited. Roan was feeling listless and ignored, she says, and Nigro gave her the impetus she needed to start working for herself. “[Dan] was just looking at me and goes ‘You are going to run your career into the fucking ground if you don’t start doing shit on your own,’” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">Roan told Rolling Stone in 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March 2022, Roan released “<a href="https://youtu.be/nXZuv1T8bfg?si=Sfu9KPq3laClLfbS">Naked in Manhattan</a>,” her first song as an independent artist, without the backing of a music label. She shot the accompanying video with friends in thrifted wardrobe on the streets of New York City.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The song sees Roan crushing on a girl friend, hoping to finally cross the line and kiss her. “Boys suck, and girls I’ve never tried,” she sings. In real life, she says, the lyric was true when she wrote it. “I was dating a boy then,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">Roan told the LA Times last August</a>. “I had never even kissed a girl when these songs [“Naked in Manhattan” and “Red Wine Supernova”] were written. It was all what I wished my life could be.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Chappell Roan - Naked in Manhattan (Official Music Video)" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXZuv1T8bfg?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Naked in Manhattan” continues the aesthetic project Roan found in “Pink Pony Club” and develops it. It’s Roan’s first explicitly queer song. (“Pony Club” covers its coming-out narrative in a thin veil of plausible deniability.) It’s also the first to feature the spoken word interlude that would become a go-to move for her. The accompanying video also debuts the “<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/chappell-roan-casual-release-1234618237/">thrift store pop star</a>” drag queen style that became her calling card: fire engine red hair, elaborate hyper-femme outfits cobbled together from thrift store pieces, a pinup girl burlesque cheekiness. It was a sign that Roan had at last found a new image that she loved. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March 2022, Roan was announced as the opener for Olivia Rodrigo and Fletcher. She continued releasing independent singles: “<a href="https://youtu.be/ePsqyPMIg6I?si=d-PcUErh9GQdzuhw">Karma</a>” and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdaKBAuO8zg">Femininomenon</a>” in August 2022, and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfSjnsYiY_A">Casual</a>” in October. In February 2023, she launched her own national tour.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the while, she was developing the character of “Chappell Roan” beyond just a stage name into a fully distinct persona like those used by the drag queens she had come to idolize. “Don’t call me baby, and don’t call me Kayleigh,” she would say at the opening of her shows. When she was performing, she stopped being Kayleigh and Chappell took over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chappell was all the things Kayleigh was ashamed of, made newly exuberant and joyful. She wore clownish white-face makeup because “that’s what the <a href="https://www.papermag.com/chappell-roan-trixie-mattel#rebelltitem2">country boys called gay people in my hometown. Clowns.</a>” She plays campily with the signifiers of her small-town background: <a href="https://5centsound.com/blog/house-of-chappell">yodeling vocal trills and camo-print merch</a>. Perhaps most significantly, she is unapologetically sexual in ways that her creator cannot quite bring herself to be.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I have such a difficult time — as Kayleigh — with sex,” she said in an <a href="https://www.polyesterzine.com/features/chappell-roan-audience-participation-playing-a-character-and-being-horny">interview with Polyester Zine in 2023</a>. “I have a hard time watching sex scenes or flirting with people! I get really uncomfortable with hyper sexual things. But as the drag queen that I play, Chappell, she&#8217;s not like that &#8211; she is very confident and comfortable singing about those things.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Don’t call me baby, and don’t call me Kayleigh,” she would say at the opening of her shows</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March 2023, Roan announced that she had signed to Nigro’s new label, Amusement Records, in partnership with Island Records.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Roan, by then, she had options. “I met with nine labels and I went in with the attitude [of], ‘This is what I need — the only thing I need right now is money,’” she told <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/music-interviews/chappell-roan-interview-red-wine-supernova-debut-album-radar-3458322">NME</a>. “So if you don’t give me this, this and this, I’m just not going to sign with you because I can keep going on my own. I was very picky and I had a fuck ton of leverage.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roan wasn’t wrong. She had all that leverage because it was clear that her moment was arriving. Now, after years of trying on personas that didn’t quite fit, of working bad day jobs and living with roommates, of scrabbling studio time and music videos together without a label to back her, it’s finally here.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A drag queen pop star in a time of moral panic</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking back over the arc of Roan’s career, it becomes clear that her music got really good and her career started to take off once she had a strong sense of who she was as an individual. That sense of self is intertwined with Roan defining herself as a queer woman.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The energy of <em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess</em> comes from the palpable joy of finding oneself and rejecting old beliefs. “Touch me, baby, put your lips on mine,” Roan instructs her sapphic crush in “Naked in Manhattan,” adding with a verbal shrug, “Could go to hell but we’ll probably be fine.” The Chappell Roan of “Good Hurt” might have believed she would go to hell if she kissed a girl. The Chappell Roan of “Naked in Manhattan” doesn’t much care either way, even if the person who wrote the lyrics hasn’t quite gotten there herself yet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If <em>Midwest Princess</em> is a celebration of finding oneself, Chappell Roan the character is the personification of that glee. Chappell, with her white-face makeup and princessy gowns that are just a little off, expresses what her creator longs for and cannot quite reach herself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The whole project is to honor my 10-year-old self. My whole persona is just me trying to honor that version of myself that I was never allowed to be,” <a href="https://www.papermag.com/chappell-roan-trixie-mattel#rebelltitem2">she told Paper in June</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is probably not just coincidence that America fell in love with Chappell Roan at the same time that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/9/7/23860447/supreme-court-drag-shows-ban-tennessee-montana-texas-florida-queens">drag shows are becoming criminalized</a>. As lawmakers position drag queens as monstrous threats to children, Roan stands for drag as the thing that saved an unhappy child, a joy, a marvelous act of creation. Her artistic project is about finding her self-identity, and as soon as she found that self, she made her a drag queen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What makes Chappell Roan so compelling to watch is that as a character, she stands for a profound release, an unshaming. She is the artistic culmination of a long search for self-discovery, and you can hear the joy and celebration of that search in the music. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is, she’s the culmination for now. Who knows what’s coming next?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you spent Monday morning following each of the cases handed down by the Supreme Court, you’re probably experiencing a bit of whiplash.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest news out of the Court on Monday, of course, is a sweeping decision holding that former President Donald Trump was effectively <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">allowed to do crimes while he was in office</a>. Indeed, under the six Republican justices’ decision in <em><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf">Trump v. United States</a></em>, it is very likely that a sitting president can order the military to assassinate his political rivals without facing any criminal consequences for doing so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just a few minutes before the Supreme Court handed down its <em>Trump</em> decision, however, it also handed down another case reaffirming that the First Amendment does not permit Republican-led legislatures to seize control of what content is published by media companies. That decision, in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-277_d18f.pdf"><em>Moody v. Netchoice</em></a>, was 6-3, with three Republican justices who also held that the leader of the Republican Party was allowed to commit many crimes while he was in office joining Justice Elena Kagan’s majority opinion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, on the same day that the Supreme Court appears to have established that a sitting president can commit the most horrible crimes imaginable <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">against someone who dares to speak out against him</a>, the same Court — with three justices joining both decisions — holds that the First Amendment still imposes some limits on the government’s ability to control what content appears online.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined both decisions in full. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the <em>Netchoice </em>opinion in full, plus nearly all of the <em>Trump</em> decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s impossible to comprehend the value system that would lead a justice to join both decisions, but nevertheless here we are. That said, the Court’s decision in <em>Netchoice</em> is a victory for free speech, even if it comes the same day as one of the most chilling decisions in the Court’s history.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s at stake in <em>Netchoice</em>?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Netchoice</em> concerns two state laws, one from Florida and one from Texas, which seek to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/22/23883888/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment-netchoice-paxton-murthy-missouri-twitter-facebook">control what content must be published by major social media platforms</a> such as Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube. Both laws were enacted by Republican legislatures, and signed by Republican governors, for the very purpose of forcing these platforms to publish right-leaning content that they would prefer not to publish.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said before signing his state’s law, it was enacted to stop an allegedly “dangerous movement by social media companies to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/22/23883888/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment-netchoice-paxton-murthy-missouri-twitter-facebook">silence conservative viewpoints and ideas</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two laws, and especially the Texas law, are extraordinarily broad. Texas’s, for example, prohibits major social media companies from moderating content based on “<a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/872/billtext/html/HB00020S.htm">the viewpoint of the user or another person</a>” or on “the viewpoint represented in the user’s expression or another person’s expression.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s such a sweeping restriction on content moderation that it would forbid companies like YouTube or Twitter from removing content that is abusive, that promotes violence, or that seeks to overthrow the United States government. Indeed, Kagan’s opinion includes a bullet-pointed list of eight subject matters that the Texas law would not permit the platforms to moderate, including posts that <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-277_d18f.pdf">“support Nazi ideology” or that “encourage teenage suicide and self-injury.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, Kagan makes clear that this sort of government takeover of social media moderation is not allowed, and she repeatedly rebukes the far-right US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which upheld the Texas law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Kagan writes, the First Amendment does not permit the government to force platforms “to carry and promote user speech that they would rather discard or downplay.” She also cites several previous Supreme Court decisions that support this proposition, including its “seminal” decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3261378222094247847&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo</em></a> (1974), which held that a newspaper has the right to final control over “the choice of material to go into” it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nothing in Kagan’s opinion breaks new legal ground — it is <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/9/22/23883888/supreme-court-social-media-first-amendment-netchoice-paxton-murthy-missouri-twitter-facebook">very well-established</a> that the government cannot seize editorial control over the media, for reasons that should be obvious to anyone who cares the least bit about freedom of speech and of the press. But the Court’s reaffirmation of this ordinary and once uncontested legal principle is still jarring on the same day that the Court <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">handed down a blueprint for a Trump dictatorship</a> in its presidential immunity case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth noting that Kagan’s decision is technically a victory for Texas and Florida, although on such narrow grounds that this victory is unlikely to matter.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Kagan’s <em>Netchoice</em> decision actually says</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The specific holding of the <em>Netchoice</em> opinion turns on a distinction between a “facial” challenge to a state law, and a more limited “as-applied” challenge.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A facial challenge, which is what the social media platforms brought against Texas and Florida’s unconstitutional laws, alleges that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications and must be effectively removed from the books in its entirety. That contrasts with an “as-applied” challenge, which merely alleges that a law is unconstitutional when it is enforced against a particular plaintiff in a particular context.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Facial challenges, however, are notoriously difficult to win. Ordinarily, as Kagan writes, a plaintiff must show that “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-277_d18f.pdf">no set of circumstances exists under which the [law] would be valid</a>,” though it is somewhat easier to win such a case in the First Amendment context.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Kagan’s <em>Netchoice</em> opinion lays out why the Texas and Florida laws are unconstitutional as applied to social media companies’ core product — a curated list of content authored by social media users — both laws are so broadly drafted that they also may apply to less core features at websites like Facebook or Twitter, such as “direct messaging or events management.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kagan faults the lower courts for failing to separately evaluate whether the laws can constitutionally be applied to these non-core features, and sends the case back down to those lower courts to do that work. That said, the bulk of her opinion is quite clear that the laws cannot constitutionally be applied to core features like Facebook’s Newsfeed or YouTube’s homepage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, on the same day that the Supreme Court holds presidents above the law, it also appears to rule that lesser public officials still must comply with the First Amendment.</p>

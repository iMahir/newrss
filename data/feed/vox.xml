<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgians are on the streets protesting following the government’s announcement it would pause the process to join the European Union until at least 2028.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The protests come amid a greater, global power struggle over the country’s place in the world order. The protesters —&nbsp;as well as the European Union and the United States — are pushing for a more democratic society that’s aligned with the West. The ruling party, Georgian Dream, meanwhile, is cracking down on liberal democracy while aligning the state more closely with Vladimir Putin’s Russia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past year, Georgian Dream has taken a number of undemocratic actions. Those include crackdowns on LGBTQ people, civil society, and press organizations. Those laws, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-russia-election-european-union-8f040cb30e1d9c9e778383cbcbb7b2c1">plus a potentially tainted</a><a href="https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/georgia/579376"> parliamentary election in October</a>, have protesters concerned that the country is moving further away from European-style liberal democracy and toward autocracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The stakes for Georgian democracy are high; Georgian Dream appears to have decided it must embrace authoritarian tactics to remain in power, and the EU accession plan is an important and powerful barrier to that. EU and NATO accession are also popular among the Georgian population, hence the enormous and contentious protests going on right now in the capital city of Tbilisi and other major cities. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now the question is whether Georgia’s democracy, such as it is, can be reoriented toward Europe and the West, or whether its fate is more along the lines of Belarus, the Russia-aligned Eastern European state ruled by dictator Aleksandr Lukashenko.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgian Dream’s latest move away from European liberal democracy may be a boon for Russia, Sam Greene, director of Democratic Resilience at the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think Moscow sees Georgia as a test case to show that it can maintain regional hegemony even after significant depredations,” such as the punishing, nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine, Greene said. “They may believe that their ability to maintain Georgia’s allegiance is a harbinger of things that may come in Ukraine — although I think they’re wrong. What’s more likely true is that they see it as a nice black eye to the EU.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while Georgia’s current political crisis is caught up in a conflict between Russia and the West, the situation is complicated by the country’s internal struggle for democracy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The fight for Georgia’s place in the world</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze announced Thursday that the government suspended talks to join the EU until 2028, and that Georgia would refuse all EU funding till then as well. <a href="https://matsne.gov.ge/en/document/view/30346?publication=36">Georgia’s constitution requires government officials to work toward EU membership</a>, and some have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/georgia-police-fire-tear-gas-scatter-protesters-russian-agencies-say-2024-12-02/">resigned in protests of Kobakhidze’s decision</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the EU had already shut down those talks back in June, after the government enacted two concerning laws. The first <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-lgbtq-rights-crackdown-election-2cac5aea651c0380d6a2829aa28c4697">severely curtailed LGBTQ rights</a>, including abolishing same-sex marriage, the right of same-sex couples to adopt, and media depictions of LGBTQ people. The second targeted nongovernmental organizations and independent press.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both are similar to Russian laws that have significantly curtailed the right to protest and organize, as well as the flow of independent information there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In Georgia, the protest is against &#8230; the Putinist type of governance which is autocratic, which is anti-Western, and tries to generate support among masses through populism, conservatism, and appeal to traditional values and so on,” Natalie Sabanadze, senior researcher in the Russia and Eurasia program at UK think tank Chatham House, told Vox. “Fundamentally, it is anti-Western, anti-liberal, and it is about one-party rule with fake opposition, and everybody else either leaves the country or is in jail.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.state.gov/statement-on-georgias-suspension-of-european-union-accession/">US responded forcefully to the pause in accession talks</a>. “​​By suspending Georgia’s EU accession process, Georgian Dream has rejected the opportunity for closer ties with Europe and made Georgia more vulnerable to the Kremlin,” the State Department said in a statement. “The Georgian people overwhelmingly support integration with Europe.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/statement-high-representative-vice-president-commission-kaja-kallas-and-commissioner-enlargement-2024-12-01_en">The EU’s response</a> has been less firm; while the bloc “regrets” the Georgian government’s decision to pause the negotiation process and halt EU funding, the statement thus far does not outline consequences for Kobakhidze’s decision, nor does it indicate how the EU and Georgian Dream will navigate this crisis if indeed the door to EU accession remains open. That, Sabanadze said, indicates a lack of consensus and a lack of leadership on the EU’s part.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That lack of clarity and consensus in the face of increasing illiberalism and democratic backsliding weakens its position in the world, Sabanadze said. “That is a big blow, in my view, to the EU, as a normative, transformative power, which was very much part of its identity up until now,” she said. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It’s not just about Russia vs. the West</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgia declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 but has never made a full transition to a consolidated democratic system. There are elections, and there has historically been space for opposition and freedom of expression, especially against the government’s more autocratic excesses. But the government and its institutions have taken the character of a <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/georgia">hybrid regime</a> — a government that uses the democratic processes to consolidate power for the benefit of a select few. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The decision to move toward the EU and NATO was initially a pragmatic one, specifically aimed at protecting Georgia’s sovereignty, which has been tenuous following Putin’s rise to power; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/03/13/world/europe/2008-georgia-russia-conflict/index.html">Russia invaded in 2008</a>, <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-hybrid-aggression-against-georgia-use-local-and-external-tools">destabilizing the country’s democratic transition</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The country’s aspirations to join the EU <a href="https://www.eeas.europa.eu/delegations/georgia/eu-enlargement-report-2024-georgia-assessment-implementation-steps-priorities_en">require democratic reforms</a> such as increased judicial independence, as well as fighting disinformation and tackling political polarization — none of which are in the interest of an <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/microsite/2/node/124652">increasingly autocratic government trying to maintain power</a>. Georgian Dream has changed significantly over its 12 years in power, shifting from a progressive <a href="https://ge.boell.org/en/2024/10/30/2024-elections-georgia-descent-hegemonic-authoritarianism">multiparty coalition to a right-wing party</a> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/georgian-ruling-party-founder-vows-ban-opposition-final-pre-election-rally-2024-10-23/">headed by a billionaire </a>who has threatened to ban opposition parties. Georgian Dream has become increasingly unpopular as it has shifted to the right, consolidated power, and also failed to improve Georgians’ material conditions; controlling state institutions and polarizing the electorate with extremist disinformation are part of the path to maintaining power.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some, however, see increasingly complex Russian meddling in Georgia’s affairs, especially following contentious parliamentary elections in October. Outside and internal elections observers reported voting irregularities, and protesters and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-russia-election-european-union-8f040cb30e1d9c9e778383cbcbb7b2c1">opposition politicians have called for new elections</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that doesn’t necessarily mean Russia is directing the Georgian move toward authoritarianism, both Greene and Sabanadze said: Georgian Dream is also trying to keep hold of power at home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I often say that the government is pro-Russian, maybe not necessarily by intent, but that&#8217;s definitely the effect,” Sabanadze said. “So the effect of this is Russia strengthening its position in the South Caucasus, Russia having a regime that it&#8217;s much more comfortable with, that it can do business with. But what motivates the Georgian Dream, whether it is necessarily love for Russia or rapprochement [with] Russia or rather love for power and the ability to and the need to stay there and take Georgia in a different direction, that&#8217;s a more complex question to be honest.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last few decades, marijuana’s had a major glow-up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1992, less than 1 million people were using it daily or nearly every day — a low point, according to an analysis of data from the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which began surveying Americans in the 1970s. Ten times as many people, meanwhile, reported drinking alcohol daily or almost daily.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1990s, weed was illegal nationally and in every state. But marijuana’s since had a major rebrand: Three decades later, it’s legal for recreational adult use in nearly half of the 50 states. Now, it’s even challenging alcohol for its status as America’s favorite daily intoxicant. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, for the first time, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.16519">more Americans were using marijuana daily, or near daily, than consuming alcohol</a> at the same rate, according to a study by <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/caulkins-jonathanp">Jonathan Caulkins</a>, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. The number of daily or near daily marijuana users has grown from less than 1 million in 1992 to 17.7 million in 2022; in terms of per capita rate, that’s a 15-fold increase. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Marijuana is having a moment just as Americans reconsider their relationship toward alcohol. As public awareness of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/4/24/17242720/alcohol-health-risks-facts">toxic effects of even moderate alcohol consumption grows</a>, many people are turning to THC products as an alternative. The THC industry touts its wares as a more natural alternative to alcohol with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425767/">myriad health benefits</a>, including decreased <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35258504/">nausea</a>, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26103031/">pain</a>, and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36539991/">sleeplessness</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rise in daily smokers (and vapers, and edible enjoyers, if you will) is also driven by the explosion of the industry. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/02/29/most-americans-now-live-in-a-legal-marijuana-state-and-most-have-at-least-one-dispensary-in-their-county/">Millions of Americans</a> live in cities and counties with retail shops offering a range of products that make the dimebags of yesteryear seem quaint by comparison: vape cartridges, edibles, oils, and waxes, offering more <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6312155/">highly concentrated THC doses</a>. The rise of marijuana retail has opened new doors for people who might have once shied away because they didn’t like smoking or were worried about breaking the law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For many people, the rapid shift toward liberalization of marijuana policy, and the swiftness with which Americans have taken up consumption, has been great. But it’s also caught researchers off guard. Society has moved more quickly than they’ve been able to keep up with. That means millions of daily users are essentially conducting a real-time experiment on their own bodies.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">Marijuana isn’t benign for everyone, though. Some of the results of the real-time experiment are already becoming apparent, both to regular users and people working in health care.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It is very desirable to believe that there is a drug that can make you feel good, that can relax you, and has absolutely no negative outcomes,” <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/about-nida/directors-page/biography-dr-nora-volkow">says</a> Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health. “But in biology, there are no free lunches.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take the emergence of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK549915/">cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome</a>, a condition marked by intense and prolonged bouts of nausea and vomiting and brought on by regular, long-term marijuana use. While once extremely rare, some doctors are saying <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/cannabis-marijuana-risks-addiction.html">they now see patients with symptoms</a> frequently. “It emerged because people were consuming marijuana regularly with high [THC] content,” Volkow says. “And similarly, there is now evidence that consumption in those patterns is associated with <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2816618#:~:text=Compared%20with%20nonusers%2C%20daily%20cannabis,42%25%20higher%20odds%20of%20stroke.">higher risk of stroke or cardiovascular disease</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maybe the most worrying studies about frequent, heavy marijuana use involve teens and young adults. (While experts say marijuana use appears to be less risky for middle-aged adults, there’s still a lot they don’t know that needs to be researched further. Some note that more research is needed on older adults in particular.) Studies show regular marijuana use among adolescents and teens can predict increased risk of the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2424288/">development of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders</a>. Others have shown an increased likelihood of depression and <a href="https://adai.uw.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cannabis-Concentration-and-Health-Risks-2020.pdf">suicidal ideation, disrupted dopamine function, and disruptions in the anatomy of the brain</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And marijuana, contrary to popular belief, can be <a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/marijuana-use-disorder#:~:text=About%2010%25%20of%20people%20who,developing%20cannabis%20addiction%20is%20hereditary.">habit forming</a>. It can also <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425760/">increase the risk of dependence on other substances</a>. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/04/us/cannabis-marijuana-risks-addiction.html?campaign_id=190&amp;emc=edit_ufn_20241017&amp;instance_id=137117&amp;nl=from-the-times&amp;regi_id=216178965&amp;segment_id=180707&amp;user_id=8814718662865e19d88b8253b3544fca">recent analysis</a> by Columbia University for the New York Times estimated that as many as 18 million people in the US may have some form of cannabis use disorder, or addiction. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Getting a handle on who might be harming their health is tricky. Even the findings that point to a major rise in daily users leave a lot of questions unanswered, especially around how often they’re smoking, vaping, or ingesting, and how potent the THC is.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Caulkins, the <a href="https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/faculty-research/profiles/caulkins-jonathanp">Carnegie Mellon</a> professor who published the research showing that more Americans are using marijuana daily, says there are different categories of daily or near daily users. There are the people who use marijuana similar to the way someone might pop a melatonin before going to bed at night — a small, daily dose to help with sleep or pain. And then there are those who are more like heavy cigarette smokers, consuming marijuana multiple times a day, morning or night, before or after meals, on breaks from work, or out with friends. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His previous research has found that daily or near daily users are a small portion of overall users, but make up about three-quarters of all marijuana purchases. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But just how many of the 17.7 million daily or near daily marijuana users are truly heavy users remains a mystery, because the US National Survey on Drug Use and Health doesn’t ask about how many times a day someone is using, or what they’re taking. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We can have people who are using near daily, but they&#8217;re taking a puff off their vape pen right before they go to sleep,” says Ziva Cooper, a researcher and director for the UCLA Center for Cannabis and Cannabinoids, “versus somebody who&#8217;s using daily or near daily and they&#8217;re using five to 10 one-gram <a href="https://dcweed.com/pre-rolls-in-dc/">pre-rolls</a> every day. You can imagine that the health outcomes are going to be quite different.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just that researchers are often unsure of how much people are taking. The consumers are also often not sure what they’re putting in their bodies. That’s partly because what’s being sold in stores is way stronger than the weed that millennials and previous generations grew up with. Over the last 25 years, <a href="https://nida.nih.gov/research/research-data-measures-resources/cannabis-potency-data">government data shows</a>, the percentage of THC in marijuana seized by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has more than tripled, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/08/high-potency-marijuana-regulation/679639/">from 5 percent to 16 percent</a>. And a lot of the products for sale in dispensaries can be even more potent — with vendors selling concentrated products, some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/23/well/mind/teens-thc-cannabis.html">claiming 90 or close to 100 percent THC.</a> Some teens who’ve used those products have struggled <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/15335/?utm_source=gquery&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=gquery-home.">with vomiting and substance abuse</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cooper says it’s not uncommon for her to end up on the phone with her patients as they read the label aloud to her and she searches the internet to try to find out what exactly they’re taking.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As researchers,” Cooper says, “we are trying to catch up with what&#8217;s actually happening in the world of cannabis. And we are woefully behind.”</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though humans have been <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7605027/">using cannabis for at least 10,000 years</a> — it was widely used for medical purposes in the United States in the late 19th century — the demonization of marijuana under the Nixon administration in the 1970s pushed the plant into the shadows. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nixon, according to secretly reported tapes, knew at the time that marijuana was “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/14/us/nixon-marijuana-tapes.html">not particularly dangerous</a>.” But his “war on drugs,” carried on by the administrations of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton forced consumers and their providers to stop or risk arrest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The drug’s public image was less threatening — smoking pot was played for laughs in movies and TV shows — but the reality of its criminalization was much darker. <a href="https://www.drugpolicyfacts.org/table/total_arrests">Hundreds of thousands of people were arrested</a> and incarcerated each year for selling and dispensing marijuana, with the harms falling disproportionately on Black people. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Public awareness of the harms caused by criminalizing marijuana grew, and so too did a movement to raise awareness about the medicinal benefits of its use, especially for chemotherapy and cancer parents, who found marijuana use helpful for combatting nausea. Meanwhile, advocates focused on reducing mass incarceration and addressing racial disparities in the judicial system pushed states to begin decriminalizing marijuana and revising the sentences for people serving time for it. After getting the states to approve marijuana for medicinal purposes, organizations began pushing for it to be legal for all adults. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/about/state-medical-cannabis-laws.html">marijuana is legal</a> for medical use in 38 states and for recreational use for adults in roughly half of the states, plus the District of Columbia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But marijuana is still illegal on the national level, where it is classified as a <a href="https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Marijuana-Cannabis-2020_0.pdf">Schedule I drug</a> — meaning the government doesn’t recognize it for medical use. That’s made getting the safety <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9903742/">approvals and government funding necessary to study the drug</a> difficult. Researchers say it’s made it harder to study potential risks of long-term marijuana use. But it’s made it harder to study the potential benefits, too. Earlier this year, the Biden administration proposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/us/politics/marijuana-schedule-drug-biden.html">changing marijuana to a Schedule III</a>, which will put it in a lower-risk category with drugs like ketamine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2022, President Joe Biden signed the <a href="https://www.addiction.rutgers.edu/congress-passes-medical-marijuana-and-cannabidiol-research-expansion-act/">Medical Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act</a>, hoping to reduce some of the federal barriers that have stymied research in the past. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8454">legislation</a> required the DEA to register and approve more researchers, and more manufacturers who can provide them with marijuana or cannabidiol (CBD). In addition to creating more opportunities and resources for researchers, the bill asked the DEA to assess whether there is enough marijuana to meet researchers’ experimental needs, and allowed doctors to discuss the benefits and harms of marijuana with their patients.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The federal government’s approach to marijuana has also meant that each state is doing its own regulation of its markets, without a concrete set of federal safety guidelines. The piecemeal nature of legalization, absence of national regulation, and lack of public awareness has contributed to the uncertainty around marijuana use and its long-term consequences. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The market is also changing rapidly. The 2018 farm bill, for example, legalized hemp, which inadvertently popularized delta-8 THC. Delta-8 THC, <a href="https://cendigitalmagazine.acs.org/2021/08/30/delta-8-thc-craze-concerns-chemists-3/content.html">which is similar to delta-9 THC</a>, is less potent in its natural form, but producers have been able to extract and synthesize the delta-8 THC in hemp, converting it into more potent concentrates. Manufacturers are now selling products the FDA <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc">says</a> have serious health risks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that isn’t the only thing that the government can and should be doing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In September, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2024/09/to-protect-public-health-federal-government-should-provide-guidance-to-states-that-have-legalized-marijuana-close-hemp-regulatory-loopholes-create-public-health-campaign">issued a report</a> outlining what state and federal governments could do to establish better public policy around marijuana and minimize potential negative public health consequences over the next five years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The report outlined specific actions, such as closing the loophole in the 2018 farm bill that legalized delta-8 THC and clarifying that all forms of THC are subject to regulation under the Controlled Substances Act. More broadly, <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/27766/chapter/1">the report calls for</a> states that have legalized, public health officials, and government agencies like the CDC to come together and establish more unified guidelines for marijuana, working to develop a set of regulations around the production and sale. Marijuana, the report argues, should be regulated the same way as alcohol and tobacco.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The report also recommends that the federal government support more research into marijuana use, along with a public health campaign to educate people about individual risks for different populations, including teens and older people. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a tall order, but even that doesn’t capture everything researchers want to know. Caulkins, for one, has other questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Cannabis intoxication impairs short-term memory formation. When cannabis was only being used as a social drug on weekends, who cares if it reduced effective performance on intellectual tasks?” he says. “Now, roughly half of cannabis is consumed by people who use often enough that they spend perhaps 50 percent of their waking hours under the influence of the drug. A lot of those hours of cannabis intoxication are while people are on the job or in school. How does that impact your functioning, how much you’re learning in college? We underinvest in thinking about the consequences of so many billions of hours of work and school time being, in some form, under the influence.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a question that might be hard to answer empirically right now. But it matters — maybe most of all for the millions of people taking part in America’s real-time marijuana experiment. “Maybe it&#8217;s not a problem,” Caulkins says. “But possibly, it&#8217;s affecting people&#8217;s abilities to meet their life goals in some subtle ways.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The new Netflix true crime docuseries <em>Cold Case: Who Killed JonBenét Ramsey</em> puts forth a theory that hasn&#8217;t seen a lot of defenders in recent years: that JonBenét’s family didn’t do it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The series, from veteran true crime director <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/2/5/18210945/ted-bundy-extremely-wicked-shockingly-evil-vile-review-netflix">Joe Berlinger</a>, takes a fresh look at the case that became arguably the biggest media sensation of 1997, the year following JonBenét’s violent death. She died sometime during the early morning hours of December 25 and 26, 1996, in her family’s massive home in Boulder, Colorado.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To this day, many members of the public look at the 6-year-old pageant queen’s parents, John Ramsey and his wife Patsy (who died in 2006), and assume their guilt. One big reason for that is <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/388794/jon-benet-ransom-note-full-text-theories">an infamous ransom note</a>, packed with weirdly specific references and movie quotes, found at the house.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet if we look beyond the ransom note, what are we left with? Not only was the evidence found at the scene insufficient for the Boulder District Attorney’s office to bring either of the Ramseys to trial, it was insufficient for a judge in a 2001 civil suit, who <a href="https://prosecutorspodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wolf-v.-ramsey-253-f.-supp.-2d-1323-n.d.-ga.-2003-__-justia.pdf">ruled</a> that “the weight of the evidence is more consistent with a theory that an intruder murdered JonBenet than it is with a theory that Mrs. Ramsey did so.” The DA ultimately <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna25608543">exonerated the pair altogether</a> in 2008.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the reason it’s so difficult to pin down exactly what happened that night is the lack of integrity of the investigation. In the hours immediately after the Ramseys called 911 to report their daughter missing, rather than treating the house as a crime scene, police allowed friends and family to traipse in and out for most of the morning and afternoon. The Ramseys and company were allowed to clean rooms, remove evidence, and tamper with JonBenét’s body. Because of this fiasco, nearly all of the publicly available evidence from the crime scene has been hotly contested and debated for decades. Other evidence from the original investigation has been unavailable thanks to a 1999 grand jury hearing. The jury <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/indictment-of-jonbentramseys-parents-released/">voted to indict</a> the Ramseys for charges of child abuse resulting in death, as well as accessory to murder, but the DA declined to move forward and the voluminous amount of evidence shown to the jurors has been sealed from the public ever since.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, over the decades, three main competing theories have emerged. The first is that one or both of the Ramseys did it. The second, arguably the most popular thanks to the 2016 CBS docuseries <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trailer-cbs-jonbenet-ramsey-miniseries/"><em>The Case of JonBenét Ramsey</em></a>, is that their 9-year-old son Burke did it and they covered up the crime. The third — the least popular theory but one that the district attorney’s own investigator believed — is that an intruder broke into the home that Christmas night.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why it’s so hard to reconcile the murder itself with the Ramseys as suspects</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most difficult parts of the case to grapple with — and the part of this case that frequently gets lost in all the furor — is that JonBenét Ramsey’s murder was extremely violent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 6-year-old was strangled using a garrote — a rope attached to an object on one end that’s typically used to tighten the rope —&nbsp;that cut deep into her throat. The garrote was made from a broken-off paintbrush handle taken from Patsy Ramsey’s paint supplies and a cord of unknown origin. She was also forcefully struck on the head with an unknown object that left an 8-inch crack in her skull. She had injuries all over her body, including two evenly spaced circular marks on her back that many have speculated could have been from a stun gun. (The CBS documentary posited that train tracks from a toy train set could also have caused this injury, but that theory seems far-fetched given the level of intentional violence inflicted on JonBenét.) Most horrifyingly, a 2003 court filing <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp2/253/1323/2567726/">revealed</a> that remnants of the handle of the same paintbrush used to garrote her were located inside JonBenét’s vagina, putting an end to years of debate about whether there was conclusive evidence of sexual assault.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts have long debated whether the autopsy report indicated <a href="https://web.dailycamera.com/extra/ramsey/1997/02/15-3.html">long-term</a> sexual abuse. Patsy Ramsey <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-ramsey-interview-part-2/">confirmed</a> that JonBenét had been experiencing bedwetting issues, which is a well-known sign of sexual abuse — but typically only when the child is older than JonBenét;<strong> </strong>at age 6, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bed-wetting/symptoms-causes/syc-20366685">nighttime bed-wetting is a normal phenomenon</a>. Further, JonBenét’s pediatrician <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/feb/16/girl-had-no-history-of-being-abused/">insisted</a> she showed no signs of sexual abuse, and to date no publicly available evidence has contradicted this. The 2003 court ruling <a href="https://prosecutorspodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/wolf-v.-ramsey-253-f.-supp.-2d-1323-n.d.-ga.-2003-__-justia.pdf">found</a> that “absent from the [Ramseys’] family history is any evidence of criminal conduct, sexual abuse, drug or alcohol abuse or violent behavior.” Although wildly popular, the theory that familial sexual abuse played a role in the crime simply isn’t supported by currently available evidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The supposition that the crime was committed accidentally seems equally implausible. JonBenét was alive while she was being garrotted — we know this because according to the <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/1996/08/13/text-of-jonbenet-autopsy-report/">autopsy report</a>, she had hemorrhaging in her eyes and heart due to the strangulation. Theories that the garrotting was staged after an accidental blow to the head — a theory popularized by former head of the police investigation Steve Thomas in his book <em>JonBenet: Inside the Ramsey Murder</em> <em>Investigation</em> — wouldn’t explain the timing of her injuries. As for JonBenét’s brother, the hypothesis that a 9-year-old with no history of violence before or after the murder could have been capable of delivering such a brutal blow to the head, either accidentally or in a fit of rage, doesn’t seem likely either. If the Ramseys did this, their loving family facade would have been obscuring deeply disturbing, dark secrets — secrets buried so deep that there’s no credible sign of them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, there’s no doubt that the Ramseys invited the decades of speculation about their involvement. In the hours after the 911 call, they acted strange. John located JonBenét’s body immediately upon being asked by the sole police officer at the scene to search the house, in another jaw-dropping police failure. He and Patsy both let the time window for the call promised by the note-writer pass by without any comment, leading the police to suspect they weren’t bothered because they concocted the note themselves. Later in the day, John went about preparing to fly the family to Atlanta, giving the impression to police that he was behaving as though nothing was out of the ordinary. (He claims he just wanted to relocate to be with his Atlanta-based family.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s some evidentiary basis for the suspicion, as well. In addition to the fact that the paintbrush handle used as the garrote came from Patsy’s paint collection, fibers from both John’s and Patsy’s clothing were found all over the crime scene. Fibers from a sweater Patsy was wearing that day were <a href="https://extras.denverpost.com/news/jon101799a.htm">found</a> on a strip of duct tape that had been placed over JonBenét’s mouth, while black fibers consistent with a sweater belonging to John were <a href="https://www.wickedlocal.com/story/archive/2016/09/10/wendy-murphy-predictable-new-nonsense/63561666007/">found</a> on her underwear. <a href="https://extras.denverpost.com/news/ram1014k.htm">According to</a> the coroner’s report, her body appeared to have been cleaned at some point, a detail that leads many people to point to the parents rather than an intruder.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the body had been cleaned, that could also theoretically explain the total lack of Ramsey DNA associated with the attack. A small sample of touch DNA was found on JonBenét’s long underwear and a DNA mixture believed to be saliva was found on her underwear. All samples were consistent with one another and all matched an unknown male contributor who has yet to be identified. That said, touch DNA, sometimes called trace DNA, is extremely easy to leave behind and therefore generally considered <a href="https://forensicresources.org/2023/challenges-with-touch-dna-implications-for-interpreting-and-evaluating-touch-dna-evidence/">more unreliable as evidence</a> than other types of DNA. Investigators also found an unknown palm print on the door of the wine cellar where JonBenét was found.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So. What do we know about who that unknown person might be?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The other suspects</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the frustrating aspects of this case is that if we’re looking for people who had access to the Ramseys’ house, the list is arguably endless; the Ramseys hosted a Christmas party for the tech company where John Ramsey was CEO&nbsp;a few days before the murder which saw hundreds of people coming in and out of the house. Other breadcrumbs in the case include multiple <a href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/media/2923/download?inline=">unverified</a> <a href="https://web.dailycamera.com/extra/ramsey/2000/26aram1.html">allegations</a> of a local child sex ring that led nowhere but gave plenty of fodder to conspiracy theorists.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are a few other frequently mentioned names associated with the case, some of which are likely to raise eyebrows.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Bill McReynolds, a.k.a. “Santa Bill”</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A family friend of the Ramseys, Bill McReynolds was so good at playing Santa that he did it for three years in a row at the Ramseys’ annual Christmas party. According to Patsy in her book <em>Death of Innocence</em>, McReynolds, a retired journalism professor, asked her to throw the party in 1996 because he was <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/1997/02/21/kuralts-blown-moment/">filming a segment</a> for famed CBS anchor Charles Kuralt’s news show and wanted JonBenét and her family to be part of it. McReynolds had a <a href="https://thewebsafe.tripod.com/02271997mcreynoldsongeraldo.htm">special friendship</a> with JonBenét — so much so that, <a href="https://jonbenetramseymurder.discussion.community/post/suspect-bill-%E2%80%98santa%E2%80%99-mcreynolds-12221151">according to</a> his wife, he took a vial of glitter she gave him with him into heart surgery.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This might all sound sweet and innocent, but it gains significance for several reasons. JonBenét had personally given McReynolds a tour of the Ramsey house, so he was familiar with the layout. Additionally, according to Laurence Schiller’s book <em>Perfect Murder, Perfect Town</em>, JonBenét had told family friend Barbara Kostanick just days before her murder that “Santa” had promised to come visit her “after Christmas.” According to Kostanick, JonBenét had emphasized that the visit was after Christmas and that it was to be a secret.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chillingly, as a child, McReynolds’ own daughter and her best friend had been kidnapped exactly 22 years earlier, on December 26, 1974. Before they were located, McReynolds’ daughter’s friend had been sexually assaulted. The perpetrator was never caught. Because of these many coincidences, the Boulder police looked into McReynolds as a suspect. Ultimately, he was cleared after he claimed to have been miles away with his family during the time of the killing. He died, still a <a href="https://web.dailycamera.com/extra/ramsey/2002/05lbil.html">beloved</a> community figure, in 2002. In interviews given since, his daughter has proclaimed his innocence, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/at/podcast/interview-with-jill-mcreynolds-a-man-who-just/id1626854863?i=1000564735543">describing</a> him as a kind and loving man “who just believed in magic.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Linda Hoffman-Pugh</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Ramseys’ housekeeper, Linda Hoffman-Pugh, is an outlier among suspects because if she committed the crime, her motive would have been not sexual but financial and perhaps personal. The Pughs — her husband is often thought to have been an accomplice — were struggling financially, and Linda had recently asked and been granted a payday loan from Patsy. Under this theory, the Pughs would have genuinely intended to kidnap JonBenét for the ransom money — Linda would likely have known about John’s Christmas bonus, mentioned in the ransom note — and would have decided to stage a sexually motivated murder together after something went horribly wrong in the commission of the kidnapping.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s little concrete evidence to support this theory, however, despite the popularity of “LHP” as a suspect. <a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-11th-circuit/1113694.html">Linda sued Patsy</a> in 2002 over a passage in Patsy’s book in which Patsy described her as acting suspiciously, but the case was ultimately dismissed.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The predators: Gary Oliva, Randall Simons, and John Mark Karr</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Netflix series spends most of its final episode exploring several known predators who each have connections to the case. Gary Oliva is a convicted sex offender who confessed, in a series of letters written from prison in 2019, to murdering JonBenét. According to John Ramsey, Oliva, who lived in Boulder at the time, was <a href="https://www.westword.com/news/jonbenet-ramseys-father-gives-thoughts-on-release-of-gary-oliva-19976076">a known suspect</a> in the case early in the investigation. He was <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/02/us-news/convicted-pedophile-who-confessed-to-jonbenet-murder-seen-following-jailtime/">released</a> from prison in January, was living as a transient, and has since <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/11/27/us-news/convicted-pedophile-who-confessed-to-jonbenet-ramsey-murder-is-missing-reports/">reportedly</a> fallen off the radar of officials. Oliva was known to have an obsession with the case and had a photo of JonBenét in his possession at the time of a 2000 arrest. In 2023, new handwriting analysis <a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/9797920/jonbenet-ramsey-update-ransom-note-handwriting-gary-oliva/">concluded</a> that he was “very likely” the author of the ransom note.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Randall Simons seems to have been an under-investigated subject at the time of the murder, despite multiple parents expressing concern about his potential involvement, according to Berlinger’s docuseries. A photographer for many of JonBenét’s child pageants, he worked with her directly on multiple photoshoots and seemed to have a prurient interest in children that ultimately revealed itself when he was <a href="https://www.registerguard.com/story/news/2021/09/17/jonbenet-ramsey-photographer-prison-child-porn-randall-simons/8386707002/">convicted</a> on 15 counts of possession of child pornography in 2021 and sentenced to 10 years. Despite his having a <a href="https://archive.org/details/RandySimons_CBI/page/n1/mode/2up">history</a> of assault charges prior to JonBenét’s murder, it’s unclear if he was properly investigated at the time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">John Mark Karr is famously the only person to have ever been <a href="https://www.dailycamera.com/2016/10/26/john-mark-karr-arrested-in-connection-with-jonbenet-ramsey-slaying/">arrested</a> in the Ramsey case, though the evidence for his guilt seems to come down to his status as a known sex offender and a really disturbing interest in the case — including a creepy recorded rape fantasy that Berlinger subjects Netflix audiences to during the new docuseries. Despite being extradited to the US from Thailand to face charges for the murder, Karr’s DNA didn’t match anything found at the crime scene so he was released.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, only faint trace amounts of DNA were located in a crime scene that was hopelessly contaminated before it was ever locked down. So — as the new docuseries argues — trying to use it to eliminate anyone seems to be as impossible as everything else about the case.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">March 26, 2024, was a weird day for me because it was the only one in my life where I was actively trying to get bitten by mosquitos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I had volunteered to be exposed to malaria as part of a study at the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) <a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/cvd/trials/mam01/">evaluating MAM-01</a>, an injectable drug meant to prevent infection. And by “exposed to malaria” I mean “bitten by mosquitos infected with malaria.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The procedure takes place in a biosafety level 2 laboratory operated by the university’s Center for Vaccine Development, and while that sounds otherworldly and high-tech, the reality was more mundane. You sit in a foldable chair at a foldable table with a bunch of other volunteers, while nurses place a small cardboard cylinder containing several infected mosquitos against your arm, separated by a mesh that keeps the mosquitos from escaping but enables them to bite you. Which they do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After that’s done, the researchers take away the mosquitos and dissect them, measuring how much blood they’ve taken from you. If the blood volume hits a certain threshold, you’re done. If you don’t, it’s time for more mosquitos to meet your arm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I was going into the lab, another volunteer who had just finished up gave me a tip: Use your socks. Take them off and rub the dirty sock soaked in your grimy foot sweat against your arm. He was right; Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes are apparently foot fetishists.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This mosquito feast in the middle of Baltimore was part of what’s called a “<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/9/21209593/coronavirus-vaccine-human-trials-explained">human challenge trial</a>,” a class of medical experiments in which therapies and preventatives are tested by actually exposing human volunteers to the pathogen they’re meant to defend against. To know if vaccines and treatments work, you need to look at people who’ve been exposed to the pathogen in question. Most studies do that by studying places where the disease is spreading rapidly. But the easiest way to know people have been exposed is to expose them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve been doing human challenge trials to test drugs and vaccines for centuries. The UMB program I volunteered for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6402913">dates back to the 1970s</a>. But these trials are poorly understood by the general public, and I had heard from sources for years that given their clear benefits, they’re underutilized in efforts to develop new treatments and protective drugs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I decided to enroll in a challenge trial to find out what, exactly, it entails. The experience was long, lasting over a year with hours upon hours of appointments. But it was incredibly safe, and though (spoiler alert) I did wind up getting malaria, the symptoms were mild and over quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My takeaway: This really isn’t that bad. And it does seem like a technique that could help save a lot of lives — if the medical research community and regulators are willing to use it, and ordinary people are willing to volunteer for it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">My challenge, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">MAM-01, the subject of this malaria challenge trial, is a “monoclonal antibody.” While ordinary vaccines induce your immune system into producing antibodies that target particular illnesses, MAM-01 skips the immune system step: It’s just a lot of antibodies made in a lab and inserted into your bloodstream. Instead of teaching your immune system to fish, you’re giving your immune system some fish.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Malaria experts are very excited about monoclonals, especially as a prophylactic in parts of the world (like the Sahel region of Africa south of the Sahara) where malaria chiefly spreads in the rainy seasons that extend from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9884660/">roughly June to October</a>. Take the monoclonal just before the season starts, and the protection could last until the coast is clear again. The hope is the shot would be more effective and offer more protection than the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23933962/malaria-vaccine-challenge-trials-drugs-tropical-disease-africa-research">recently approved vaccines</a> for the disease.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In a place like Burkina Faso in the Sahel, where there&#8217;s near zero transmission outside a four- to five-month window, you could, with a single encounter, stop a full year of transmission,” <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/leadership/philip-welkhoff">Philip Welkhoff</a>, who directs malaria efforts at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, told me. But for that to work, the monoclonal has to be very highly effective, and to be that effective, the antibodies need to be specific enough to the strain of malaria that’s circulating.&nbsp;And unfortunately, Welkhoff added, “It looks as though the first two [candidates] are not going to be quite there yet.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of those first two candidates is MAM-01, and sure enough, about two weeks after my mosquito bites, I tested positive for malaria. It wasn’t a bad case: I was put immediately on Malarone, a combo pill of two anti-malarial drugs, and I only had one day of noticeably unpleasant symptoms: nausea, chills and fever, muscle aches. I binged season two of <em>Will Trent</em> and napped a lot, and then I was fine. But I couldn’t help but feel mildly bad: MAM-01 may yet be very effective, but it’s not 100 percent effective. My dumb immune system made sure of that. Sorry, Philip.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was the most exciting week of the trial. The rest of it was incredibly routine. I got two injections of MAM-01, once in October 2023 and again in May 2024. In addition to wanting to see if this would prevent malaria infection, the researchers were interested in how long the antibodies stayed in my system. That meant returning to the lab (at first daily, then weekly, then fortnightly, then monthly) to have my blood drawn from an arm vein and/or squeezed from a prick in one of my fingers, to see if the antibodies were still circulating, both in large blood vessels and tiny capillaries. This also entailed driving an hour and 15 minutes each way between my house in Washington, DC, and the lab in Baltimore a total of 34 times, usually for a procedure that took maybe five minutes total.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Eighty-five hours of driving was, to be honest, pretty annoying — more annoying than actually getting malaria — but it had a silver lining: I got through most of the audiobooks of <em>War and Peace</em> and <em>The Power Broker</em> on those trips on I-95. Malaria’s major side effect was to make me more cultured, and also possibly the only person on Earth to associate a tropical disease with Moscow in winter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This routine, mundane process means that malaria trials get a decent number of recruits compared to other challenge trials (especially from people who, unlike me, live in Baltimore). “We&#8217;re actually pretty lucky,” <a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/profiles/lyke-kirsten/">Kirsten Lyke</a>, professor of medicine at the University of Maryland and the principal investigator in my trial, told me. “We&#8217;ve been pretty successful recruiting. Not to say that it&#8217;s easy, but we&#8217;ve developed social media and a lot of different techniques to reach out to people.” I should note that my study is <a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/cvd/trials/malaria-prevention-research-study/">still recruiting people</a>, as are <a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/cvd/trials/">several others at the Center for Vaccine Development</a>; I’m particularly excited for one testing a <a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/cvd/trials/malaria-mrna-vaccine-trial/">new mRNA vaccine for malaria</a>. If you’re in DC or Baltimore, it’s worth considering.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, the kind of relaxed outpatient experience common for malaria studies isn’t necessarily the same for other illnesses. Keller Scholl, an AI policy researcher I know in DC, did a <a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/life-in-the-time-of-zika/">challenge trial in which he was exposed to and contracted Zika</a>; his trial was inpatient, requiring him to stay in a special hospital dormitory for nine days, a burden against which my trial looks like child’s play.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jake Eberts went viral after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220414095624/https://twitter.com/wokeglobaltimes/status/1510768591012085768">live-tweeting his experience</a> as a volunteer in a challenge trial for shigella, one of the bacteria that causes dysentery. He got a fever of 103 degrees, plus diarrhea and blood in his stool. “I truly felt like I could not move,” Eberts later told a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/man-drank-smoothie-that-gave-him-dysentery-for-vaccine-trial-2022-4">reporter</a>. He also had to collect his watery, bloody waste for researchers to analyze. He earned slightly more money than I did for his trial, but personally I think he should have gotten <a href="https://jme.bmj.com/content/46/12/815">maybe 10 times as much</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unsurprisingly, Lyke told me that recruiting for shigella and cholera trials is a lot harder than for malaria.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A brief history of challenge trials</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To join my challenge trial, I had to read through a 21-page document explaining in meticulous detail exactly what the trial entailed. I had to go through a screening appointment, pass a quiz about the contents of that 21-page document, and sign many forms. Every one of the dozens of visits I’ve made as part of the study has begun with a nurse asking me if I consent to continuing with the study.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For my troubles, I’ve been paid $4,740 so far. I’m donating all of that to the <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf">Against Malaria Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium">Malaria Consortium</a>, since I didn’t want any readers to think my impression of the experience was inappropriately biased by being paid. After deducting the mileage costs and dividing by the 85 hours driving and maybe 30 hours in labs and tests, it works out to about $12.50 an hour, below <a href="https://www.epi.org/minimum-wage-tracker/">Maryland’s minimum wage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I say all of this to emphasize that UMD conducts these studies with the highest professional and ethical standards, and I emphasize that because I know “deliberately infecting people with diseases” is a genre with a long, and sometimes less than noble, history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ve had challenge trials for as long as we’ve had vaccines. Edward Jenner, who pioneered the vaccination of patients against smallpox by injecting them with fluid from cowpox sores, <a href="https://www.jameslindlibrary.org/articles/edward-jenners-1798-report-of-challenge-experiments-demonstrating-the-protective-effects-of-cowpox-against-smallpox/">repeatedly exposed his gardener’s son to smallpox after the inoculation</a>, to prove it worked.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/82_2022_253">modern history of challenge trials</a> begins with the 19th-century Cuban doctor Cárlos Finlay, who for decades attempted to demonstrate that yellow fever was spread by mosquitos. The disease was a major scourge at the time; in a famous 1793 outbreak, about <a href="https://news.virginia.edu/content/walter-reed-and-scourge-yellow-fever">one in 10 Philadelphians died of the disease</a>, and the federal government (then headquartered in the city) was forced to shut down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finlay conducted studies deliberately exposing volunteers to mosquitos, killing some subjects and infecting many, but the results were still inconclusive. His work inspired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_William_Lazear">Jesse Lazear</a>, a young Army doctor posted in Cuba after America conquered it from Spain, who sought in 1900 to prove the Finlay thesis. He did so by deliberately coaxing a mosquito to bite him. Lazear got yellow fever and died, evidence American officials took somewhat more seriously than Finlay’s work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lazear’s death helped inspire his boss, Walter Reed (after whom the famous military hospital would later be named), to adopt <a href="https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article-abstract/181/1/90/4158283?redirectedFrom=fulltext#google_vignette">one of the first ethical codes ever for clinical trials</a>. Participants in human trials overseen by Reed in 1900 signed a letter, in English or Spanish, confirming, “The undersigned understands perfectly well that in case of the development of yellow fever in him, that he endangers his life to a certain extent but it being entirely impossible for him to avoid the infection during his stay in this island, he prefers to take the chance of contracting it intentionally in the belief that he will receive … the greatest care and the most skillful medical service.” Every volunteer also received $100 (about <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1800-">$3,800 today</a>), plus another $100 if he fell ill or died.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reed’s trials would ultimately help prove Finlay right that mosquitos transmit disease, specifically yellow fever. That led to a mosquito eradication campaign that <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5349382/">proved wildly successful</a>: In the 1890s, an average of 462 people in Havana died of yellow fever every year, but not a single death was recorded after September 1901, after the eradication campaign was underway. Reed’s studies identified the main culprit behind the plague and enabled public health officials to eradicate it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the 1930s and ’40s, there were <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/82_2022_253#Sec4">challenge units</a> studying the flu in the Soviet Union, the US, Australia, and <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Cold_Wars/ALxG44e0bfAC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PA26&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=chimpanzee">the UK</a>. Perhaps the most storied effort was the <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/82_2022_253#Sec6">Common Cold Unit</a> located in a hospital in the small English city of Salisbury, which used human volunteers to study the virus (specifically a coronavirus) that causes the common cold. While the unit obviously did not produce a cure, it did give us a greater understanding of coronaviruses in general (which came in handy when a different coronavirus ignited a pandemic in 2020), as well as some delightfully British promotional videos:</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="IN SEARCH OF THE COMMON COLD GERM" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkcgFR5F7jc?rel=0" width="720" height="405" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But these challenge studies were also occurring at a time and in places where what we’d now consider absolute bare minimum ethical procedures were not followed. While Reed did pay his volunteers and get consent forms, he was still experimenting on incredibly poor Cubans, as a member of an occupying army. Some of the earliest challenge studies on malaria were conducted on <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/543656">prisoners at Stateville Penitentiary</a> in Illinois. Anthony Allison, the researcher who determined that the same genes that cause sickle cell anemia also protect against malaria, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7431914/#Sec5title">demonstrated this</a> through a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2093356/pdf/brmedj03376-0014.pdf">challenge trial exposing Kenyans to malaria</a> — conducted by Allison, a white South African, while Kenya was an English colony. These are conditions of domination where freely given consent is impossible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it feels important to clarify that today’s challenge trials, like the one I joined, are ethically scrupulous to a fault. The Center conducting the trial emphasized informed consent again and again until it became annoying; all participants knew the exact risks, and the exact procedures from the get-go, but they were still reminded constantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moreover, those risks were very low. The reason why challenge studies have been going on longest for malaria out of any infectious disease is, in part, because today it is trivially easy to cure malaria in rich countries with strong medical infrastructure, especially when the strain of malaria is one that researchers have hand-selected, that we know is not drug-resistant, and in which the long-term effects of a single infection are minimal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Studies evaluating the safety record of challenge trials confirm this. A recent <a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/76/4/609/6758436?login=false#396235529">comprehensive review of 308 studies from 1980 to 2021</a>, which enrolled over 15,000 patients altogether, found that challenge studies during that period did not result in a single death. They led to 24 &#8220;serious adverse events,&#8221; or SAEs, a frequency of less than 0.2 percent. Even better, the authors clarify, &#8220;it is unlikely that any SAEs captured in this review were life-threatening,” not least because they occurred in hospitals where any problems could be caught very early.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Surveys of modern challenge trial participants have found that medical risks are among the least of their concerns. &#8220;Most participants said the burdens were greater than the risks, most commonly mentioning the time commitment and frequent blood draws,&#8221; the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1556264618820219">authors of one survey found</a>. This fit my experience: It never felt dangerous, but it occasionally felt annoying.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/7/e033796">survey of volunteers in the Netherlands</a> found that 84 percent of participants reported being proud of their choice, 89 percent would encourage others to volunteer, and 85 percent would do a similar trial again. I agree with all three (though maybe not a trial that requires 85 hours of driving) —&nbsp;and generally, if such an overwhelming share of participants have the reaction “I want to do this again,” that’s a sign that you’re onto something.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why challenge trials could be game changers for TB and hepatitis</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I, like many people, first heard of challenge trials in the depths of the Covid-19 pandemic, when they appeared to be a way to test possible vaccines more rapidly, potentially saving huge numbers of lives by shortening the emergency. I wrote about them <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/9/21209593/coronavirus-vaccine-human-trials-explained">sympathetically</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/5/20/21258725/covid-19-human-challenge-trials-vaccine-update-sars-cov-2">repeatedly</a> — but ultimately, none of the three vaccines available in the US were tested through challenge trials. They were approved based on traditional “field trials,” based on how effectively they reduced infections among people just going about their business in a world full of Covid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To some extent, this was only possible because the governments of the US, UK, and Brazil, where most of the trials occurred, failed so miserably at controlling the virus. “If the UK, US, and Brazil had been run by leaders interested in preventing viral transmission in the way that many other countries did, it&#8217;s really difficult to see how we would have developed vaccines,” <a href="https://www.mcri.edu.au/researcher-details/josh-osowicki">Josh Osowicki</a>, physician and senior researcher at the Murdoch Children&#8217;s Research Institute in Melbourne, told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first randomized controlled trial <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7745181/">evaluating effectiveness for the Pfizer vaccine</a>, for instance, had 43,448 participants. Eight participants getting the vaccine wound up becoming infected with Covid; 162 of the placebo group were. The study needed to be that huge because a smaller study would have risked not having anyone in either group infected, not due to any feature of the vaccine but simply because at the time the virus was not spreading enough to be noticeable in a small-scale study. So even with a virus that was spreading quite rapidly, doing a field trial required massive investment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was fair enough in the Covid-19 case; the US government was <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/18/23560407/operation-warp-speed-pandemics-vaccines-covid-white-house-biden-trump">willing to spend just about any amount of money to develop a vaccine as fast as possible</a>. But what about neglected diseases, like malaria? “It’s one of the problems with malaria,” Lyke told me. “It’s not a problem that affects the US, so there’s never any sense of urgency.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means researchers operate under tougher budget constraints, while field trials can still prove to be hugely expensive. Very little information is publicly available on trial costs for vaccines, but a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264410X09011062?via%3Dihub">paper examining vaccines for rotavirus</a> — which causes diarrhea in children and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9208428/">kills about 150,000 kids a year</a> — reported a rough estimate of $2,000 to $3,000 per subject for phase 3 trials alone. (Phase 1 and 2 trials are tiny and cost only a few hundred dollars per subject).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That implies that, say, the recent <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02511-4/fulltext">5,500-person trial of the R21 malaria vaccine</a> could have cost some $11 million. For diseases with lower “attack rates” (that is, a smaller share of the population getting infected during the study period), the cost is even higher. At the extreme end, a phase 3 trial for a tuberculosis vaccine is <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2023/06/funding-commitment-m72-tb-vaccine-candidate">budgeted to cost $550 million</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be blunt: If we need to spend $550 million to test every TB vaccine candidate, we will never get a reliable TB vaccine. There just isn’t enough money, especially not for a disease that overwhelmingly kills poor people in poor countries.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/gettyimages-1667722.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.8291399418862,100,80.341720116228" alt="A doctor, in black silhouette in a dark room, examines several x-ray images of a person’s chest and lungs, which are brightly lit by a lightbox from behind." title="A doctor, in black silhouette in a dark room, examines several x-ray images of a person’s chest and lungs, which are brightly lit by a lightbox from behind." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A doctor examines the X-rays of a tuberculosis patient at a clinic in 2002 in Brooklyn. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Spencer Platt/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most important things challenge trials do is enable “down selection”: They let researchers evaluate candidate vaccines and drugs cheaply and quickly, with a few dozen volunteers, rather than over a long time with tens of thousands of participants. Because you are directly exposing people to the pathogen, you know the attack rate is very, very high. “Let’s say you test a vaccine here in the US [in a challenge trial]. It has zero efficacy,” Lyke says. “Then there’s no way, if you took it to the field, that’s going to work.” The challenge trial lets us eliminate that option and move on to other ones.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Osowicki and colleagues recently reviewed how well <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00294-3/fulltext">challenge trials predicted real-world efficacy</a>. The correlation was pretty good. Sometimes, the challenge nailed it: Typhoid conjugate vaccine was 87 percent effective in a challenge study, and 95 percent effective in the field. But sometimes candidates that worked in challenge did worse in the field, as was the case with the RTS,S malaria vaccine or the intranasal flu vaccine. The reverse, though, didn’t happen: We don’t have any major cases of a vaccine that failed in a challenge trial but worked in real life (though, in fairness, few vaccines that fail at the challenge stage progress to field trials). Challenges thus serve as a weeding mechanism: You can cheaply rule out vaccines and treatments that seem unlikely to work in the field.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also why researchers on diseases like TB are working hard on challenge models that would enable them to test candidate vaccines faster and more cheaply. This is tough for TB, which can take years after infection to show symptoms, requires a months-long course of antibiotics to treat, and even then can persist in patients. That means that field studies take agonizingly long and are extremely expensive, but also that we cannot ethically expose people to wild-type TB for a challenge study. It’s a horrible situation to be in with a disease that <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/tuberculosis">kills an estimated 1.3 million people a year</a>, more than twice as many as malaria and more than any other infectious disease today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To deal with that problem, <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/fortune-lab/sarah-fortune/">Sarah Fortune</a>, a professor of immunology at Harvard Medical School, has been developing a variant of TB to be used in challenges. “We’ve invented a TB strain that’s addicted to doxycycline and trimethoprim,” two different antibiotics, she told me. “In the absence of them, it blows up.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is exactly what you’d need for a challenge study: a version of TB that has a kind of “kill switch,” in that it will die off completely if participants stop taking those two drugs. That means a study participant could be infected, have TB for the duration of a challenge trial, and have it completely eradicated afterward if they simply stop taking the antibiotics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s taken us about seven years to figure out how to make that system meet our own safety standards,” Fortune says, but she thinks it’s ready. Their genetically modified TB variant is preparing for FDA review right now. And she and fellow professor <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/rubin-lab/eric-rubin/">Eric Rubin</a>, a collaborator on the research, are putting their money where their mouths are in terms of safety: “Eric and I decided we’d be volunteers one and two.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/369095/hepatitis-vaccine-deaths-symptoms-infections">Hepatitis C</a>, which kills <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/376461/9789240091672-eng.pdf#page=28">about 240,000 a year</a>, is another illness where vaccine progress seems prohibitively expensive and difficult without a challenge model. The people most at risk for the illness are those using injection drugs like heroin (people who inject drugs or “PWIDs” in public health lingo), which is an inherently difficult population to do a field trial with.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The last time they did a traditional trial for a vaccine candidate, it took over six years [and] was extremely expensive because it had to recruit from people who have high risk for hepatitis C, which tends to be both a very vulnerable population and a population that is difficult to retain in clinical trials,” <a href="https://www.1daysooner.org/team/circe-mcdonald/">Circe McDonald</a>, who leads hepatitis C work at the pro-challenge trial nonprofit 1Day Sooner, told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McDonald notes that <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2023345">the one phase 1/2 trial</a> of a hepatitis C vaccine candidate cost about $10 million to $11 million, with 548 participants; a phase 3 trial would require tens of thousands of participants and cost at least an order of magnitude more. By contrast, once we have a version of hepatitis C that’s safe to use in a challenge (which at least two teams are working on now), a challenge trial might cost $1 million to $2 million.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Osowicki and colleagues have put together a model for another neglected illness, although one you’ve probably heard of: strep, specifically &#8220;group A&#8221; streptococcus. While most associated with childhood sore throats and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velveteen_Rabbit">burnt plush rabbits</a> in rich countries, group A strep bacteria impose a massive global burden. In extreme cases, the disease is much worse than strep throat or even scarlet fever. In &#8220;invasive group A streptococcal disease&#8221; (IGAS for short), &#8220;the presentation is severe, invasive, sudden, explosive infection,&#8221; Osowicki explains.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We don&#8217;t have as reliable data for strep as for TB, malaria, or hepatitis, but by &#8220;really really conservative estimates,&#8221; Osowicki says, 150,000 to 200,000 people a year die from iGAS. Another 300,000 to 400,000 people a year die from rheumatic heart disease, a chronic condition caused by damage from strep infection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite this, we’ve had <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27032515/">little progress</a> toward a strep vaccine since the 1970s, when the FDA <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41541-023-00609-x">effectively banned</a> further studies on the fear that vaccines themselves could lead to rheumatic heart disease or acute episodes (it lifted the ban in 2006). Part of the problem is it’s just incredibly hard to study in the field. IGAS only results in very rare cases; rheumatic heart disease develops after a long lag, making it difficult to detect in a time-limited study. It would be much easier to expose people to strep, and Osowicki has worked with experts around the world to develop a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30240-8/fulltext">strep throat human challenge model</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Talking to researchers about projects like these, it almost started to feel like challenge volunteers, like me, were a kind of cheat code. Biomedical research is unbelievably difficult and expensive, especially if you’re working on diseases that primarily kill a lot of people in poor countries where they can’t pay much for vaccines. Anything that makes that easier seems like a worthy task. In my case, that meant some long car rides and a day of bad malaria. I think that was, easily, worth it. Maybe it’ll be worth it for you too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shortly after <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2024/05/melinda-french-gates#:~:text=Melinda%20French%20Gates%20has%20decided,of%20people%20live%20better%20lives.">departing the Gates Foundation</a> in June, Melinda French Gates <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/opinion/melinda-french-gates-reproductive-rights.html">surprised 12 people with a $20 million grant each</a>. Most of them were doing work focused on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/09/nx-s1-5137259/melinda-french-gates-charitable-giving-women-girls-womens-health">helping women and girls</a>’ mental and physical health globally — a cause she has backed for years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But one&nbsp;grant went to Richard Reeves, president of the <a href="https://aibm.org/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwr9m3BhDHARIsANut04bvEHUC-tF_WYfvhiIeZ0h5Bc5QkCObcTnShIffS3tU9gNTEzrOUaEaAqb0EALw_wcB">American Institute for Boys and Men</a>, a new nonpartisan think tank distinctly not centered on girls or women. “I doubt anyone was more surprised than me,” Reeves told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As never-ending headlines will remind you, women globally face sexual harassment and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/367732/india-rape-doctors-kolkata-sexual-violence-delhi-modi">assault</a>, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/explainers/356314/abortion-laws-roe-wade-dobbs-decision-mifepristone-supreme-court">rollback of reproductive rights</a> and bodily autonomy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5915075/2024/11/16/olympics-athletes-kenya-cheptegei/">gender-based violence</a>, and in low-income countries, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/girlseducation">limited access to education</a>. It can be easy to forget that in many ways, women are doing much better now than they once were. As recently as 1970, girls trailed behind boys in academic performance. But at least in the US, today’s women have more than caught up: Many more women <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-male-college-crisis-is-not-just-in-enrollment-but-completion/">earn bachelor’s degrees</a> than men, and <a href="https://aibm.org/why-we-exist/focus-areas/education-skills/">young girls outperform boys</a> in K–12 schools.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a progressive person, it can feel uncool — problematic, even — to wonder whether men are doing all right. Okay, so maybe men have fallen behind for a cosmic millisecond, after millennia of reaping the patriarchy’s rewards. Should I break out the world’s smallest violin?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think some visceral skepticism about this is entirely appropriate,” Reeves said. “I think that to try and wave that away is just naive.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the world does appear to be in the midst of a masculinity crisis: Today’s men and boys are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/">lost</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/22/loneliness-is-killing-men-and-without-proper-support-and-intervention-nothing-will-change">lonely</a>, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/us/2022/11/26/smr-reeves-men-in-trouble.cnn#:~:text=Men%20account%20for%20almost%203,the%20labor%20force%20is%20plummeting">dying by suicide at alarming rates</a>. The increasingly toxic, polarized political landscape largely hinges on<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/"> young men desperately seeking affirmation</a> from whoever will give it to them. Moderates and the left have struggled to construct a more palatable modern masculinity, and it’s driving many young men toward the far-right “manosphere” —&nbsp;where anachronistic attitudes about women, society, and gender roles are resurging.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Men need better support, but that does not need to come at the expense of helping women. People of all genders are enmeshed in the same communities — if men can help each other find their place amid changes in the culture <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/">and the labor market</a>, that security and self-confidence will have ripple effects across their social networks. Shifting some focus — and charitable dollars — toward issues specifically affecting men’s health, education, and employment will benefit everyone.&nbsp;</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The making of a masculinity crisis</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The World Economic Forum created the Global Gender Gap Index, a benchmark tracking gender equality in 2006; since then, they have <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2024.pdf">detected only a 0.1 percentage point improvement</a> in gender equality. Women still <a href="https://www.vox.com/24132057/caitlin-clark-wnba-draft-2024">get paid less than men</a> and will likely <a href="https://www.care.org/news-and-stories/the-hidden-heroes-of-the-climate-crisis/">shoulder the worst financial effects of the climate crisis</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it is also true that gender gaps in education and health have nearly closed and women have gained an earth-shattering amount of economic freedom in less than a century. Before 1974 — when some Gen X-ers were already well into elementary school — US banks could <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/a-bank-of-her-own/#:~:text=The%20Equal%20Credit%20Opportunity%20Act,sex%20and%20race%20in%20banking.">stop women from opening an account</a> without their husband’s signature. Now, <a href="http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/187761468179367706/pdf/WPS7255.pdf">roughly two-thirds</a> of women worldwide have bank accounts, about the same as men.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People can feel the difference. In <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/10/17/how-americans-see-men-and-masculinity/?utm_source=Pew+Research+Center&amp;utm_campaign=9aa701a222-Weekly_10-19-24&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-9aa701a222-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D">a recent Pew survey</a> of over 6,200 American adults, most agreed that women are doing better than they were 20 years ago in terms of being promoted to leadership positions at work, getting well-paying jobs, and being admitted into a college or university. Most people also said that evolving gender roles — more women working outside the home and more men taking charge of chores and child care — have helped women lead more satisfying lives.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Vox guide to giving</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving —&nbsp;from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href="https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“One of the huge contributions of the women’s movement has been to break away from a narrow view about what femininity is,” Reeves said, “without destroying the very idea of femininity.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just look at Barbie. Since debuting as a model in 1959, she has had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/interactive/2023/barbie-jobs-careers-visualized/">over 200 careers in six decades</a>, spanning nearly every industry imaginable. Barbie’s career journey reflects the <a href="https://msmagazine.com/2023/07/23/barbie-girl-woman-feminist/">expansiveness of girlhood</a>: Increasingly, young girls are taught to imagine themselves as whatever they want, whether that’s a ballerina, a business leader, or a microbiologist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Barbie’s boyfriend, <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/6/21/15843126/barbie-ken-diverse-man-bun-mattel">Ken</a>, has held only about 40 jobs since his debut in 1961. Of those, roughly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_(doll)">half</a> involved sports or serving in the military. As Greta Gerwig’s 2023 blockbuster movie put it: “She’s everything. <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/7/24/23805608/barbie-movie-explained-2023-ken-feminist-im-just-ken-ryan-gosling-oscars">He’s just Ken</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the real world, as women gain ground in school and at work, many men feel they are falling behind — and they don’t have many good options to find support. Male vulnerability is <a href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/recognizing-trauma-boys-and-men">widely stigmatized</a>, leading men to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5734549/">stay silent when they’re struggling</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The left <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/23813985/christine-emba-masculinity-the-gray-area">seems to fear</a> that focusing on men will undermine women’s progress. The right, meanwhile, responded with reactionary gender politics, <a href="https://www.vox.com/vox-conversations-podcast/22834353/vox-conversations-david-french-republican-party-trump-masculinity">accusing</a> the left of trying to destroy traditional masculinity entirely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well-established institutions have contributed to that gendered polarization. A few years ago, <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/01/ce-corner">new research</a> led the American Psychological Association (APA) to conclude that “traditional masculinity — marked by stoicism, competitiveness, dominance and aggression — is, on the whole, harmful,” aligning with the public discourse around gender during the Me Too movement and its critique of “<a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/2019/1/22/18188776/toxic-masculinity-gillette-ad-apa-guidelines">toxic masculinity</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But some advocates for modern masculinity fear the APA’s insinuation that masculinity itself is the problem was an overreaction that generated a worrying backlash. As established models of masculinity were dismantled, no coherent alternatives have emerged to take their place, leaving a void open for the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/12/14/13576192/alt-right-sexism-recruitment">manosphere</a> to fill. “It’s a bit like the kaleidoscope’s been shaken but the pieces haven’t settled yet,” Reeves said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Feminist allies like <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366523/blake-lively-drama-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-hoover-movie-feud">Justin Baldoni</a> made undefining masculinity a personal brand, exploring what it means to be a modern man through panels, podcasts, and memoirs. But “you’re not going to pull in the masses with the Justin Baldonis of the world,” said <a href="https://www.zacseidler.com/">Zac Seidler</a>, global director of men’s health research at <a href="https://au.movember.com/">Movember</a>, a global men’s health charity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/">Men are going through an identity crisis</a>, where seeking motivation, purpose, and meaning have become rooted in politics, acting as a pipeline to radicalization rather than something deeper like community. Reeves said the tricky part of getting men unstuck is asking, “How do we not get trapped by something, while still recognizing that it is a thing?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2014, then-President Barack Obama attempted to walk this line with the <a href="https://www.obama.org/programs/my-brothers-keeper-alliance/">My Brother’s Keeper</a> program, which <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/foundations-join-forces-to-fight-inequality/">collected over $300 million</a> in the mid-2010s to expand education and job opportunities for at-risk young men of color. At the time, many people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/03/12/the-assumptions-behind-obamas-initiative/my-brothers-keeper-initiative-echoes-of-a-sexist-history">pushed back</a> against their gendered mission. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/opinion/Kimberl-Williams-Crenshaw-My-Brothers-Keeper-Ignores-Young-Black-Women.html">In a 2014 essay for the New York Times</a>, law professor <a href="https://www.law.columbia.edu/faculty/kimberle-w-crenshaw">Kimberlé W. Crenshaw</a> — who first coined the term “<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination">intersectionality</a>” — wrote that the initiative “amounts to an abandonment of women of color” and that progressive support for the initiative signaled “the consequent erasure of females of color is regarded as neither politically nor morally significant.” Over 1,000 women of color agreed, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/she-the-people/wp/2014/06/18/1000-women-of-color-want-women-and-girls-included-in-my-brothers-keeper/">signing a letter</a> arguing that women and girls should be included in the program.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their vigilance is understandable: The vast majority of philanthropy is gender-neutral, with nearly a third of charitable donations <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/pretty-scary-7-things-to-know-about-religions-decline-and-charitable-giving#:~:text=In%20the%20early%20to%20mid,had%20dropped%20to%2029%20percent.">going to religious organizations</a> alone. <a href="https://philanthropy.indianapolis.iu.edu/news-events/news/_news/2024/giving-to-womens-and-girls-organizations-exceeds-10-billion-for-first-time-yet-still-represents-1.9-percent-of-charitable-giving-in-the-us.html">Less than 2 percent</a> of philanthropic giving in the United States directly benefits women and girls. While $10.2 billion <a href="https://philanthropy.indianapolis.iu.edu/news-events/news/_news/2023/giving-usa-total-us-charitable-giving-declined-in-2022-to-49933-billion-following-two-years-of-record-generosity.html">out of $516.65 billion</a> looks like a shockingly small slice of Americans’ donations, some estimates suggest that initiatives focused on men and boys receive an even smaller slice of our charitable dollars.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because most men’s health initiatives are relatively small and underfunded, “a little bit of philanthropy could really go quite a long way,” Reeves said. Grants like the one he received from Gates send a strong signal to philanthropists that advancing gender equity isn’t a zero-sum game: Addressing issues affecting men and boys doesn’t have to take anything away from women and girls.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The data has spoken: Men are struggling</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This identity crisis appears to be manifesting, in part, as a mental health crisis. Men are four times more likely than women <a href="https://aibm.org/research/male-suicide/">to die by suicide</a>, and suicide rates have risen by 30 percent among young men since 2010. If men’s suicide rates were the same as women’s for the past 25 years, 546,000 men<strong> </strong>might still be alive today — that’s greater than the population of Atlanta.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That violence <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/htius.pdf">also turns outward</a>: Men commit 90 percent of homicides in the US, and make up over three-quarters of homicide victims. Of 172 mass shootings that happened between 1966 and March 2021, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/27/us/woman-shooter-nashville.html">168 assailants — nearly 98 percent of them — were men</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past 20-odd years, public health campaigns have focused on getting men into therapy. They’re working, kind of: While women in the US are still more likely to seek mental health care than men, the fraction of men who received some form of counseling <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/673172/mental-health-treatment-counseling-past-year-us-men/#:~:text=Mental%20health%20treatment%20or%20counseling%20among%20U.S.%20men%202002%2D2021&amp;text=In%202021%2C%20around%2012%20percent,counseling%20in%20the%20past%20year">roughly doubled</a> between 2002 and 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The real problem, <a href="https://aibm.org/commentary/mental-health-with-men-in-mind/">Seidler wrote</a>, is that “the focus on getting men through the therapy door has led to a neglect of what happens once they get there.” The APA itself frames masculinity as harmful and <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/01/ce-corner">places the burden</a> of becoming an optimal therapy participant on men in distress. In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15579883211014776">a survey of over 2,000 Australian men</a>, almost half said they dropped out of therapy without telling their therapist. When asked, over half of them said they didn’t drop out because of stigma or cost; they left because they didn’t feel connected with their therapist.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than condemning manhood outright, Seidler advocates for therapists to work with, rather than against, stereotypically masculine traits like stoicism, protectiveness, and problem-solving. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are certain facets of traditional masculinity that have served men very well, and that do not need to harm women or other groups,” Seidler said. “How can we talk about them in a positive light, and try to make them healthy rather than harmful?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The big problem: Most therapists don’t know how to connect with men. Part of it is simply that <a href="https://www.zippia.com/therapist-jobs/demographics/">only about a quarter</a> of therapists are men (and Black men make up <a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/s-o-s-we-need-more-black-men-as-therapists-now/">a small slice</a> of the psychology workforce in the US). <a href="https://aibm.org/commentary/mental-health-with-men-in-mind/">Seidler’s research has also found</a> that regardless of gender, many therapists dismiss men as “not psychologically minded,” and view some young men as unteachable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seidler frames suicidality in men as a problem of relationships — not just an internal mental illness, but a struggle to relate with others. Whether it is hardwired or not, many men <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/10/christine-emba-masculinity-new-model/">resonate with a social model</a> that positions them as protectors and providers. When those roles are taken away — through a sudden layoff, for instance, or a devastating breakup — men can lose their sense of purpose.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alcohol overdoses and suicide, for instance, <a href="https://ofboysandmen.substack.com/p/working-class-men-a-troubling-update">killed about three times more working-class men</a> than non-working-class men — and all men are more vulnerable to deaths of despair than working-class women. Reeves predicts that this is, at least in part, because working-class men are more vulnerable to work-related injuries and health challenges that ultimately put them out of work. These men are also less likely to be married or have close friends.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it doesn’t have to be this way. Right-wing influencers already exploit protector-provider tropes to give young men a sense of identity, but there’s room for the political mainstream to work with these themes, too — without maligning women in the process.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How can we help?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Okay, maybe men do need help. So what do we do?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When it comes to gender,” Reeves said, “one of the things that I hear a lot is that someone puts a program in place, and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2845878/#:~:text=One%20of%20the%20most%20common,socioemotional%20leadership%20in%20the%20family.">the people who show up skew female</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If boys and men don’t show up, Reeves urges organizers to ask themselves what can be done to help them show up. For example, he points to a strategy that military leaders use to invite challenging conversations. They call it “<a href="https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2020/june/racial-tension-america-requires-intrusive-military-leadership">intrusive leadership</a>,” but really, it’s just intentionally asking, “Are you okay?” It sounds simple, but when an empathetic leader invites someone who looks up to them to be vulnerable, it <a href="https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2024/april/intrusive-leadership-saved-life-closest-me">can go a long way</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked experts how charitable donations can most effectively help address men’s issues, they all agreed that funding more research is a top priority. “At the moment, everything is guesswork,” Seidler said. To find out what young men need, elder men need to ask them. “Every young boy is on Twitch,” Seidler said. His approach at Movember: “Go to where the men are.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, Movember <a href="https://insidersport.com/2024/10/31/the-esports-report-blast-movember/">recently partnered with BLAST</a>, an esports tournament organizer, to discuss men’s mental health at its <a href="https://blast.tv/premier/world-final-2024">world final event</a>. The nonprofit also runs an annual initiative encouraging hairdressers to invite their clients to chat about their lives at the barbershop, where they’re more likely to open up, complete with an online tool <a href="https://conversations.movember.com/en/">to practice starting the conversation</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reeves also advocates for funding initiatives that train men in HEAL professions — jobs in the fields of health, education, administration, and literacy — to mirror successful campaigns to recruit more women into STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math). Men in Mind, an Australian program led by Seidler, is experimenting with a training program that aims to equip therapists of all genders to better navigate sessions with male clients. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-28575-001">Early results are promising</a>, but no equivalent exists in the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reeves said piloting programs like this in the US could be a high-impact area for targeted male-focused philanthropy — not just in psychology, but in education, nursing, and other traditionally female-dominated professions. Existing organizations are mostly small and underdeveloped: the <a href="https://swe.org/">Society of Women Engineers</a>, for instance, had a revenue of <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/131947735">$17.6 million</a> in 2023. <a href="https://realmenteach.com/our-campaign">Real Men Teach</a>, which supports future male educators of color, raised about $26,000. To a nonprofit of that scale, Reeves said, “a little bit of philanthropy could really go quite a long way.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Funding classroom studies that focus on young boys themselves could help tackle the other side of the issue. For example, <a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/04/boys-school-challenges-recommendations">studies show</a> that boys tend to benefit from more hands-on learning over a “sit and get” approach. Reeves thinks that “<a href="https://oaklandside.org/2022/11/21/literacy-tutoring-programs-show-promise-in-oakland/">high-dose tutoring</a>,” or close instruction multiple times a week in addition to standard classroom learning, is one option. Investing more heavily in <a href="https://aibm.org/commentary/apprenticeships/">apprenticeships and vocational training</a>, which tend to skew male, is another — young men <a href="https://ofboysandmen.substack.com/p/vocational-education-is-male-friendly">seem to learn better</a> when goals are clear and results are immediate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most important thing to remember: Acknowledging that men and boys are struggling does not take away from the fact that women and girls have struggled for generations. Charitable giving doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. The cause of gender equality will only be enhanced by empowering men to lift up their own communities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have to lift all boats,” Seidler said. “Without that mentality, we will suffer. Women and girls will suffer as well.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reeves agreed: “It’s very, very hard to imagine a world of flourishing women in a world of floundering men.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you want to help human beings alive right now, there are few better places to give than global health.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Diseases that have been largely eradicated in the US still claim hundreds of thousands of lives abroad. In 2018, the most recent year for which there’s data, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/ss/ss7108a1.htm">seven Americans died of malaria</a>; all acquired it abroad. But the World Health Organization estimates that worldwide, <a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/330011/9789241565721-eng.pdf?page=52">405,000 people</a> died of it that year, most of them children in Africa.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US and other rich countries have succeeded in stamping out these diseases because eliminating them is fairly cheap. That is an opportunity for people seeking to give and make others’ lives better: It means that saving a life in a relatively poor country is possible at relatively low cost. <a href="https://givewell.org/">GiveWell</a>, our favorite evaluator of global health charities, estimates that the groups it recommends can <a href="https://www.givewell.org/how-much-does-it-cost-to-save-a-life">save a life for $3,000 to $5,500</a>. Put another way, giving $250 a month for a year could be enough to save someone’s life. There are gym memberships that cost more than that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So if you want to donate to global health groups, where should you start? There are too many good causes to list here, but hopefully the ones below give you some ideas.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fighting malaria</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">GiveWell, the charity evaluator, currently lists four groups on its <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">“top charities” list</a>. Two of them focus on malaria: <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, and the <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium">Malaria Consortium</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two groups take two different approaches to preventing malaria transmission, both of which are extremely cost-effective. Against Malaria focuses on funding and distributing insecticide-treated nets, which people in malarial regions (largely sub-Saharan Africa but also parts of South Asia) can sleep under and protect themselves from bites by malaria-carrying mosquitos.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Vox guide to giving</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving —&nbsp;from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href="https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The nets themselves are incredibly cheap. GiveWell estimates that <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf">Against Malaria</a> can provide a net for $4 to $6 each. You may have heard in the news that bednets are sometimes used for other purposes, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/25/24047975/malaria-mosquito-bednets-prevention-fishing-marc-andreessen">fishing</a>. That’s true. GiveWell estimates, based on past studies and their own research, that about <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets#What_proportion_of_nets_are_used">63 percent</a> of nets distributed will be used as intended. But even with nearly two out of five nets being diverted to other uses, the intervention is still incredibly cost-effective. A meta-analysis looking at five randomized studies of bednets found that <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets#How_do_net_distributions_affect_malaria_cases">mortality from any cause fell by 17 percent</a> among children targeted for bednet distribution (whether they used the nets or not); they were 45 percent less likely to get malaria. The effect on children actually using the nets is, of course, much greater.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other program GiveWell recommends donating to is the <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium">Malaria Consortium’s Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention initiative</a>, which uses another approach to prevent malaria infections. “Chemoprevention” means giving antimalarial medications to at-risk people before they’re bitten by a mosquito, in hopes of preventing a malaria infection. The campaigns are seasonal because in many malarial regions, malaria-carrying mosquitos only thrive and transmit the disease in certain seasons, often during a summer rainy season where there’s more water for mosquitos to breed in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seasonal chemoprevention is a newer approach than bednets, but there’s <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention#Reduced_mortality_for_young_children">very strong evidence</a> that it’s effective at stopping malaria transmission. GiveWell cites a <a href="https://www.mmv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/access/SMC_Tool_Kit/publications/Meremikww-ipt-review.pdf">Cochrane Collaboration review</a> of six randomized studies that found that malaria cases among young children fall by 73 percent due to seasonal chemoprevention campaigns. GiveWell itself <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention#Reduced_mortality_for_young_children">extended that review</a> to add two newer studies, and drop an older one that they thought less relevant, and got a similar number: 75 percent less malaria among young children.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A year of chemoprevention costs very little per person, about <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention#Summary-01">$5.69 in Burkina Faso</a>, for instance. Combining that low cost with that degree of effectiveness makes it a very inexpensive way to save someone’s life.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Giving kids vitamin A</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s pretty easy to get enough vitamin A if you’re in a rich country and can easily access leafy greens like spinach or lettuce, or other vegetables like carrots. But in many poor countries, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10416138/">vitamin A deficiency is a serious problem</a>, which in children can lead to stunting, blindness, or even death.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thankfully, there’s a simple way to fight vitamin A deficiency: Give people vitamin A. <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international">Helen Keller International</a>, a charity founded in 1915 by Keller, the noted deaf-blind writer and activist, is one of the world’s leading groups supporting vitamin A supplementation campaigns, and one of GiveWell’s top recommended charities. It subsidizes governments in affected countries and provides technical support for mass campaigns to distribute vitamin A capsules (about $1 each to deliver) to households with children.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">GiveWell recommends Helen Keller because vitamin A supplementation, in their view, significantly reduces child mortality, by about 4 to 12 percent. They <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/vitamin-A#Reduced_mortality_for_young_children">base this</a>, as with their malaria judgments, on a <a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub3/epdf/full">Cochrane meta-analysis</a>, which, depending on assumptions used, concluded that vitamin A supplementation reduces mortality by between 12 and 24 percent. That said, the largest study included there <a href="https://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/Interventions/Vitamin%20A/Awasthi_etal_2013a_VitaminASupplementation.pdf">produced a much smaller estimate</a> (4 percent), and there’s some reason to believe <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/vitamin-A#Open_questions_and_uncertainties">publication bias</a> has led studies to conclude vitamin A supplementation is more effective at preventing deaths than it really is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even 4 percent to 12 percent is a very big drop in mortality. What&#8217;s more, vitamin A supplementation has other benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It can prevent blindness and stunting, helping children grow up with healthy vision and to healthy heights and weights, which could <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/vitamin-A#Long-term_income_increases">translate into higher incomes</a> and other benefits as an adult. Though the evidence here is less voluminous than on mortality, it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s more to global health than just preventing deaths. Vitamin A can prevent deaths, but it also makes the lives it saves easier and more fulfilling.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Backing vaccinations</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A recent study suggested that in the past fifty years, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24138291/do-vaccines-work-explained-study-efficacy-evidence">vaccines have saved 154 million lives</a>, the vast majority of children under 5. Yet vaccine-preventable illnesses like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/369095/hepatitis-vaccine-deaths-symptoms-infections">hepatitis A and B</a> or <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099(24)00176-2&amp;page=18">streptococcus pneumoniae</a> still kill millions every year. Expanding access to the vaccines we already have can be as important as developing new ones.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But reaching the so-called last mile of hard-to-reach populations not currently being vaccinated can be difficult. <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives">New Incentives</a>, the fourth and final charity recommended by GiveWell, tries a simple method to reach them: offering money. It gives cash incentives of around $9.50 to parents and other adults in northern Nigeria as an incentive to get <a href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives#Vaccines_incentivized">vaccinated against</a> against measles, pneumococcal disease, tuberculosis, and the five diseases the pentavalent vaccine protects against (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Hib).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/NewIncentives/IDinsight_Impact_Evaluation_of_New_Incentives_Final_Report.pdf">randomized trial</a> of New Incentives&#8217;s programs released in 2020 found that overall, children targeted by the program were <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/new-incentives#How_much_does_the_program_increase_vaccination_rates">22 percentage points more likely to be vaccinated</a>: 36 percent of children in the control group were immunized, compared to 58 percent in the group receiving incentives. Even if you suspect the actual impact isn’t quite that significant, the program is extremely cost-effective; GiveWell itself estimates that the effect is more like 9 to 18 percentage points rather than 22, but still ranks New Incentives as one of its top charities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting local NGOs</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Empowering and funding local, community-based organizations — as opposed to large, global agencies such as the World Health Organization or the Red Cross — helps create a more nimble, sustainable, and culturally relevant aid environment. Local organizations not only have a better understanding of local needs, but they can respond faster to emergencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Funding local organizations is also more cost-efficient because it cuts out the expensive overhead and salary costs that international agencies divert donations to cover. In a recent <a href="https://thesharetrust.org/passing-the-buck">report</a> based on detailed analyses of aid budgets in Ukraine, Nigeria, and the Middle East, economists estimated that funding local organizations would save almost $30 billion in salaries and overhead currently spent at large international groups. Donor agencies such as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the <a href="https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/what/humanitarian-aid/localisation_en#:~:text=In%20the%20humanitarian%20sector%2C%20localisation,and%20efficient%20when%20locally%20driven.">European Commission</a> have pledged to increase support and funding for local NGOs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are some local NGOs working to address challenges from health care and gender-based violence to unemployment and social development:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://pichaeats.com/en/about-us">PichaEats</a> is a catering company based in Malaysia that trains refugees to be professional chefs. The program helps refugees become financially stable while providing lifelong skills in cooking, branding and marketing, and logistics. Since 2016, the NGO has trained 40 refugees from Syria, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Palestine, Iraq, and Pakistan.&nbsp;</li>



<li>For 18 years, <a href="https://www.rwamrec.org/">Rwanda Men’s Resource Centre</a> has worked to teach healthy masculinity, promote gender equality, and reduce gender-based violence. For the past five years, gender-based violence has been steadily <a href="https://www.ecoi.net/en/document/2101192.html">rising</a> in the east African country. According to 2020 survey data, almost 40 percent of girls and women aged 15–49 years have experienced physical, sexual, or psychological violence. The NGO has a variety of training programs and community engagement events that teach couples and young people how to resolve conflict and cohabitate peacefully, improve communication and joint decision-making, and to leverage new tools to improve financial instability.&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://afyaresearch.org/about-us/">Afya Research Africa</a> is a Kenyan NGO working toward universal health coverage by providing affordable primary care in rural communities. The organization funds door-to-door health services and supports brick-and-mortar health clinics and pharmacies. Afya also provides rare funding for its clinicians to conduct locally relevant research.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Aid to Sudan</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sudan continues to face the most devastating humanitarian crisis in the world. For more than a year, the country has been embroiled in a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/23712710/sudan-war-khartoum-burhan-hemedt-rsf">civil war</a> that has displaced millions of people, pushed some communities to the brink of famine, and crippled the national banking, health care, and telecommunications systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, the conflict remains one of the most neglected in the world. As of September, the United Nations has received less than <a href="https://www.cfr.org/article/crisis-sudan-war-famine-and-failing-global-response#:~:text=The%20UN%20funding%20goal%20of,only%20been%2048%20percent%20met.&amp;text=The%20UN's%20funding%20plan%20for,Ukraine%2C%20as%20has%20funding%20provided.&amp;text=However%2C%20humanitarian%20funding%20for%20both,totaled%20%24114%20billion%20since%202022.">half</a> of the humanitarian funding it requested earlier this year. Meanwhile, staff from international aid and human rights groups have repeatedly faced challenges <a href="https://www.rescue.org/article/crisis-sudan-what-happening-and-how-help">accessing</a> the most fragile parts of the country while other organizations have been forced to <a href="https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/news/2023/08/01/exclusive-sudanese-aid-workers-face-hundreds-job-losses">lay off</a> local aid workers due to insecurity and budgetary constraints. These local and international NGOs are still working to fill critical gaps across Sudan and in neighboring countries hosting refugees from Sudan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Doctors Without Borders (MSF) provides health services to thousands of people across Sudan despite recurrent attacks against health care workers and health clinics. MSF doctors and nurses have treated tens of thousands of people facing malnutrition to avert famine-related deaths. The NGO is also working to quell a <a href="https://www.msf.org/cholera-latest-peril-sudan">cholera outbreak</a> in eastern Sudan and to ramp up care for expecting <a href="https://www.msf.org/sudan-pregnant-women-and-children-dying-shocking-numbers-south-darfur">mothers</a> who are dying from preventable infectious diseases. In many places, MSF clinics are the only functioning health care facilities still caring for people. </li>



<li><a href="https://www.wearealight.org/sudan">Alight</a> is a local group providing health care across five Sudanese states. Currently, the organization runs 42 primary health clinics, a field hospital, and four mobile health facilities. The NGO recently launched a program to feed mothers who give birth in severely resource-limited refugee camps.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Surveillance to find the next pandemic</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most years, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/11/07/g-s1-30783/tb-tuberculosis-deadliest-infectious-disease-covid">deadliest infectious disease in the world is tuberculosis</a>, a brutal bacterium that’s also frustratingly expensive to eradicate (which is why none of GiveWell’s top charities <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/mass-screen-and-treatment-programs-tuberculosis">target it</a>). But in 2020, 2021, and 2022, there was a new deadliest-disease, and you can probably guess its name: Covid-19.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All told, the Sars-Cov-2 virus has <a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths?n=o">killed over 7 million people</a>, with estimates of “excess deaths” (including deaths due to disruptions to the economy and health care access, and ones due to Covid but not reported as such) <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates">reaching into 20 to 30 million</a>. The world spent untold trillions to fight the pandemic. It would have been much more humane, and cheaper, to have prevented it in the first place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, pandemic monitoring and prevention is the job of governments rather than charities, but there are nonetheless some valuable groups working to prevent a repeat of the Covid experience. One is the <a href="https://naobservatory.org/">Nucleic Acid Observatory</a>, a project developing ways to surveil wastewater and other sources and notice when novel pathogens start showing up. The technologies they&#8217;re helping to build could help us catch things like Covid weeks or months earlier, and give us time to squash them before they become full-fledged pandemics.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ending lead poisoning</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22834666/lead-exposure-poisoning-developing-countries">Lead poisoning</a> has, historically, been a major blind spot in the global health world. The extent of the problem is enormous: A <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(20)30278-3/fulltext">landmark study</a> found that about half of children in poor countries are exposed to very high levels of lead. At least <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/lead-poisoning-and-health">1.5 million people die</a> annually from cardiovascular diseases (like heart disease) caused by lead poisoning, imposing a global economic cost of about <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(23)00166-3/fulltext">$6 trillion a year</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the resources devoted to preventing lead poisoning were minimal. One <a href="https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/global-lead-exposure-report">estimate in 2021</a> found that charities and nongovernmental organizations were spending between&nbsp; $6 and 10 million a year on the problem. That’s less than two cents per child poisoned by lead.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is starting to change, as the the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and UNICEF have <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/375139/lead-partnership-usaid-unicef-samantha-power">launched a joint venture funded with $150 million over four years</a> to address the problem. But that’s still relatively little in the scheme of things.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While there are several worthwhile charities working on this issue, I (Dylan) recommend in particular <a href="https://www.pureearth.org/">Pure Earth</a>, which has been a leader on lead and metal contamination for decades; the <a href="https://leadelimination.org/">Lead Exposure Elimination Project</a>, which has been influential in fighting lead paint specifically in developing countries; and the <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/call-action-end-childhood-lead-poisoning-worldwide-neglected-top-tier-development">Center for Global Development</a>, which has become the center of lead policy in the global health world and helped mae the issue a bigger priority in recent years.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Combatting superbugs</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers estimated that more than <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02724-0/fulltext?mkt_tok=NDkwLUVIWi05OTkAAAGCOwuIZk6PC62ka11T3aZOVQ4bGfdDtfrsMK0TZRNysKlXpBt2Ki44YMDQkmCs6r9ZTVnfOJb4dOfOJHV7uPHuCC4uZKs87QwUCxNFKMtQhwFe">1 million</a> people died globally from antibiotic-resistant infections in 2019. Despite the emerging crisis, antibiotic research and development has long stalled. No large US or European pharmaceutical company is working to develop new antibiotics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fortunately, a small but growing group of researchers and clinicians has been working to revive a decades-old treatment for drug-resistant infections: <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/373174/phage-therapy-antiobiotic-resistance-africa-innovation">bacteriophages</a>, viruses that target and kill bacteria. Phage therapy is starting to make inroads in the US and Europe, though clinicians still have to request emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, or equivalent agencies, before the treatment can be used. Today, there are some <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?intr=Bacteriophage">80 clinical trials</a> for phage therapy in the US alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while phage therapy is gaining ground in developed countries, many developing countries in Africa and Asia are falling behind, even though the burden of drug-resistant infections is highest in these countries. A lack of regulatory agencies to review and approve the treatment is one major barrier. Another is an absence of local manufacturing infrastructure, which has hindered local drug development in developing countries for years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers consistently demonstrate that phage therapy is safe and effective for treating drug-resistant infections, even those caused by bacteria that no known antibiotics can treat. What is needed now is for the phage therapy technology and expertise to be transferred to developing countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is the mission of <a href="https://www.phagesforglobalhealth.org/">Phages for Global Health</a>, an NGO run by Tobi Nagel and an international team of physician researchers. The organization trains laboratory technologists in Africa and Asia to study phages in their labs and partners with institutes to conduct research and develop new phage products that can be used, for instance, to prevent and quell cholera outbreaks and decontaminate poultry products to prevent foodborne illness.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21727010/giving-tuesday-explained-charity-nonprofits" data-source="encore">Giving Tuesday</a> —<strong> </strong>the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving and the internationally recognized day to contribute to charity<strong> </strong>—<strong> </strong>is upon us.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/23/18109042/black-friday-twitter-facebook-instagram">Black Friday</a>, the day after Thanksgiving, has always been the kickoff event of the holiday shopping season and one of the biggest shopping days of the year. Marketing experts recognized how popular it<strong> </strong>was and followed it up with Cyber Monday, a second day of mega-sales focused on online shopping, and then Small Business Saturday — making the period after Thanksgiving famous for its blitz of deals.</p>

<p>Some people noticed that would likely leave a lot of people looking to step away from shopping and do something a little more meaningful.</p>

<p>In 2012, <a href="https://www.92y.org/">the 92nd Street Y</a> in New York and the <a href="https://unfoundation.org/">United Nations Foundation</a> introduced Giving Tuesday with the hope that after several days of big sales and rampant consumption, there’d be interest in giving back.</p>

<p>“I remember [92nd Street Y director] Henry Timms saying, ‘All the days of the week are going to be taken, we should grab Tuesday,’” Rob Reich, a professor of political science and philosophy at Stanford who studies <a href="https://www.vox.com/philanthropy" data-source="encore">philanthropy</a> and who participated in the development of Giving Tuesday, told me.</p>

<p>They were right.<strong> </strong>#GivingTuesday went viral almost immediately, and now 11<strong> </strong>years later, it’s stronger than ever.</p>

<p>At launch, #GivingTuesday was just an idea, some publicity, a social media hashtag, and a package of advice and branding for organizations anywhere that wanted to participate. The 92nd Street Y developed the hashtag, marketing advice, and resources, and released them all for any nonprofit to use.</p>

<p>“It was a deliberate choice not to have intellectual property,” Reich told me. “We had a website with a logo but it was not copyrighted. You could use the hashtag, you could do whatever you wanted with it. Everyone could put their own content into it, with the hope it could spread.”</p>

<p>Since Giving Tuesday’s launch in 2012,<strong> </strong>nonprofits all over the US — and, eventually, all over the world — have hosted fundraisers and events, using the branding and hashtag associated with the movement. (Giving Tuesday formally <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/GivingTuesday-Is-Now-an/247573">broke off from the 92nd Street Y</a> in 2019<strong> </strong>to become an independent organization.)</p>

<p>In its first year, it’s <a href="https://nonprofitssource.com/online-giving-statistics/giving-tuesday/">estimated</a> that about $10 million was donated to charity through online Giving Tuesday fundraisers. The following year, it was $28 million — and the momentum hasn’t really slowed.</p>

<p>Donations hit a <a href="https://issuu.com/givingtues/docs/2022_givingtuesdayimpactreportfinal?fr=sMjk3NTU4OTQyMDU">record high in 2022</a> but <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/givingtuesday-results-are-flat-nonprofits-raise-3-1-billion">stayed flat in 2023</a>: Giving Tuesday reported that total giving in the US reached $3.1 billion and some 34 million people participated.</p>

<p>The rapid growth in donors and awareness underscores the fact that Giving Tuesday has become a phenomenon in its own right — an outlet for a backlash against the <a href="https://www.vox.com/consumerism" data-source="encore">consumerism</a> of the holiday shopping season.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The perfect conditions to launch Giving Tuesday</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Vox guide to giving</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving —&nbsp;from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href="https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<p>But &#8230; well, many people also hate the post-Thanksgiving shopping crush, and question what it says about us as a society.<strong> </strong>Vox has covered its <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/11/20/18103516/black-friday-cyber-monday-amazon-fulfillment-center">grueling effects on the retail workers who make it happen</a>. The website <a href="http://blackfridaydeathcount.com/">Black Friday Death Count</a> documents instances of violence in retail stores during Black Friday sales.</p>

<p>So the idea of a day, after the sales, to step away from buying and focus on giving struck a chord. (Besides, some researchers have posited a link between <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/27/20983850/gratitude-altruism-charity-generosity-neuroscience">generosity and gratitude</a>, which makes after Thanksgiving a good time to get people to think about giving.)</p>

<p>Giving Tuesday has been picking up steam since its first year. In 2013, its second year, it received coverage in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131029144154/http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=1651#.UwAkC4XJ1Xo">Charity Navigator</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Giving-Tuesday-s-Second-Year/153969">Chronicle of Philanthropy</a><em> </em>and a headline donation from <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8457895/givewell-open-philanthropy-charity">Facebook billionaire Dustin Moskovitz</a> to the top global poverty charity <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/1/9826838/best-charities-donate-2018-giving">GiveDirectly</a>. It also went international.</p>

<p>“We’ve grown to 80 countries, [and] recently welcomed South Sudan and Peru and Nepal and Greece,” Giving Tuesday CEO Asha Curran told me. “Giving Tuesday exists in countries where Black Friday and Cyber Monday don’t exist, and that reminds us that there’s this value that unites us.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Does Giving Tuesday do any good?</h2>

<p>All of this activity is still a relatively small share of total charitable giving. In 2022, Americans gave <a href="https://theconversation.com/us-charitable-donations-fell-to-499-billion-in-2022-as-stocks-slumped-and-inflation-surged-207688">$499 billion to charity</a>.</p>

<p>Compared to that, the $3.1 billion that people in the US contributed in 2022<strong> </strong>on Giving Tuesday is just a drop in the bucket. Even if Giving Tuesday continues its exceptionally fast growth for another decade, it wouldn’t be the main source of funding for most charities.</p>

<p>That’s probably a good thing. The best thing for charities is to get regular donations, ideally monthly recurring ones. While a day like Giving Tuesday can be a great occasion to put giving in the news and start a conversation about our ability to do good in the world, it wouldn’t be good for it to become a make-or-break fundraising event for nonprofits.</p>

<p>But the fact that Giving Tuesday contributions are still a small share of all charitable donations doesn’t mean they don’t matter. It doesn’t take millions of dollars to save a life — it is estimated you can <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/1/9826838/best-charities-donate-2018-giving">save a life, or do a comparable amount of good</a>, for only a few thousand.</p>

<p>And there’s another way Giving Tuesday matters: It’s “not just a fundraising day,” Curran said. It’s a day when people talk and think about giving back.</p>

<p>“Donating money is the most common behavior” that the Giving Tuesday team documents, “but<em> only</em> donating money is the<em> least</em> common behavior,” Rosenbaum told me. Most people participate in making the world a better place in multiple ways: through donations, through volunteering, through sharing information about great organizations, and through directly doing important work.</p>

<p>For a sector of our economy where we spent over<strong> </strong>$400 billion last year, with tens of thousands of organizations working on different projects, the question of how to do good in the world is not discussed enough. It’s probably a good thing for us to talk a little more about how we make the decisions that improve our world.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A day for getting better at doing good</h2>

<p>Giving Tuesday’s organizers won’t tell people where to give or volunteer. Making the most of the occasion, though, requires thoughtfulness about the impact of your contributions, whatever form they take. It’s a great occasion to dive into the conversation about how to do good in the world. One of the reasons we need a day focused on giving is that most people care deeply about their communities, their causes, and the world — but don’t necessarily know how to get the most results with their money, time, or <a href="https://80000hours.org/">career</a>.</p>

<p>My colleague Dylan Matthews has written about <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/1/9826838/best-charities-donate-2018-giving">some strategies to make your money go further</a> — from checking with charity evaluators to targeting the poorest people to funding basic research and the development of new solutions to our problems. Effective altruist groups have developed resources for ensuring that the causes and charities they’re excited about can make the most out of the day, including <a href="https://www.eagivingtuesday.org/">donation matching events</a>.</p>

<p>Ultimately, making the world a better place requires generosity and a dedication to measuring impact, talking about what we want to achieve, and gaining a better understanding of the problems we’re trying to solve.</p>

<p>If you care about animals and want to reduce their suffering, but aren’t sure exactly how, Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) is an organization that might be able to help.</p>

<p>The California-based nonprofit puts out an annual guide for recommended animal charities, and it just released <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/announcing-our-2024-charity-recommendations/">its list</a> for this year. (Disclosure: ACE has<strong> </strong>helped fund some of <a data-source="encore" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect">Future Perfect</a>’s work since 2020.) </p>

<p>Most of the top charities focus on improving conditions on factory farms, which makes sense, given that they’re sites of suffering on a massive scale. It’s not just the death that takes place there — in the US, factory farming kills more than <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">10 billion</a> land animals each year — but the suffering that animals are forced to endure while they’re alive. Hens, calves, and pigs are often confined in spaces so small <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22576044/prop-12-california-eggs-pork-bacon-veal-animal-welfare-law-gestation-crates-battery-cages">they can barely move</a>, and conditions are so galling that “<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/11/18176551/ag-gag-laws-factory-farms-explained">ag-gag</a>” laws exist to hide the cruelty from the public.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="http://vox.com/meatless-newsletter"><strong>Sign up for the Meat/Less newsletter course</strong></a></h2>



<p>Want to eat less meat but don’t know where to start? <a href="http://vox.com/meatless-newsletter">Sign up</a> for Vox’s Meat/Less newsletter course. We’ll send you five emails — one per week — full of practical tips and food for thought to incorporate more plant-based food into your diet.</p>
</div>

<p>When we hear about some of these conditions — like the fact that chickens are forced to produce eggs at such a fast rate that their&nbsp;<a href="https://thepoultrysite.com/cocciforum/issue9/30/intestinal-fortitude">intestines sometimes partially fall out</a>&nbsp;under the strain — we may want to put a stop to them. But it can be hard to know which charities will actually make good use of our dollars.</p>

<p>ACE researches and promotes the most high-impact, effective ways to help animals.<strong> </strong>The group<strong> </strong>uses three main criteria when deciding whether to recommend an organization:</p>

<ul>
<li>Charities must be “<a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charities/">likely to produce the greatest gains for animals</a>”&nbsp;— that is, they’re doing high-impact work and they’ve got the evidence to back it up. </li>



<li>Charities must “<a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charities/">actively evaluate and improve their programs</a>” — they’re constantly trying to figure out the most effective way to advocate for animals (which may change over time) and adjusting their programming accordingly. </li>



<li>Charities must “have a demonstrated need for more funding” — they actually need more money on hand in order to reach everyone they know how to reach (which is not the case for every charity).  </li>
</ul>

<p>With this in mind, ACE has selected its recommended charities for 2024:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">1) <a href="https://www.sinergiaanimalinternational.org/">Sinergia Animal</a>: Industrialized meat production is growing rapidly across Latin America and Asia, and Sinergia Animal — which was founded only six years ago in 2018 — has quickly become a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23344716/future-perfect-50-carolina-galvani-animal-welfare-activist-sinergia-animal">leader</a> in fighting back against it. The group has investigated conditions at numerous farms, persuaded dozens of food companies in the Global South to commit to higher animal welfare standards, and worked with school cafeterias to serve more plant-based meals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2) <a href="http://Ali.fish">Aquatic Life Institute</a>: Fish are consumed in higher numbers than any other animals — an estimated <a href="https://fishcount.org.uk">1.1 to 2.2 trillion</a> are scooped out of the ocean annually, with an additional estimated 124 billion farmed in what activists describe as “underwater factory farms.” Aquatic Life Institute was formed in 2019, making it one of the first animal protections groups focused on advocating for wild-caught and farmed fish and crustaceans. <a href="https://www.ali.fish/impact">So far</a>, the organization has helped pass Washington’s and California’s bans on octopus farming, persuaded major food companies to improve the treatment of aquatic animals raised and caught for food, and improved welfare standards for major seafood certification programs, among other changes.</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">3) <a href="https://vegetarisk.dk/">Dansk Vegetarisk Forening</a>: Operating in Denmark, this group makes plant-based food more accessible by working with grocery stores, food companies, school cafeterias, and more to expand their meat-free offerings. It also works to change government policy, and in recent years, it scored two big wins: the Danish parliament and government set aside around $200 million to advance the country’s plant-based industry, and Denmark’s agriculture minister launched an <a href="https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2023/10/23/denmark-unveils-the-world-s-first-action-plan-for-plant-based-foods">“action plan”</a> to help the nation transition its food and farming sectors to be more plant-based.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">4) <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/faunalytics/">Faunalytics</a>: This US-based <a href="https://faunalytics.org">nonprofit</a> is a bit meta in its approach to animal advocacy: It conducts and publishes independent research, mostly related to farmed animals, in an effort to make other animal advocates more impactful and evidence-based.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For example, it examines <a href="https://faunalytics.org/fundamentals/">social psychology data</a> on how to influence public opinion about animals in a way that actually leads to behavior change. ACE notes that advocacy research is a neglected intervention, writing, “Faunalytics’ programs support the animal advocacy movement by examining effective advocacy strategies, problem areas, and tactics, and by providing advocates with a curated database of academic research summaries.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">5) <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/good-food-fund/">Good Food Fund</a>: China is home to more farmed animals — about 56 billion alive at any point in time — than any other country. The Good Food Fund works to shift China’s food system in a more plant-based direction using a variety of approaches, including educating chefs on meat-free cuisine, training youth advocates, and organizing conferences to bring together industry, policymakers, and other stakeholders on the issue. </p>

<p>6) <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/">The Humane League</a>: Founded in 2005, this <a href="https://thehumaneleague.org">organization</a> operates in the US,<strong> </strong>the UK, and Japan. It runs successful campaigns urging corporations to adopt higher <a data-source="encore" href="https://www.vox.com/animal-welfare">animal welfare</a> standards. It has worked to end the use of battery cages internationally and <a href="https://betterchickencommitment.com/">improve conditions</a> for chickens raised for meat. It also conducts grassroots legislative advocacy. Importantly, The Humane League has an evidence-driven outlook, collecting and using data to guide its approach, and testing new ways to improve its programs.</p>

<p>7) <a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/wild-animal-initiative/">Wild Animal Initiative</a>: As my colleague Dylan Matthews has <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22325435/animal-welfare-wild-animals-movement">documented</a>, this group is doing something unique: researching and <a href="https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org">advocating for ways to help wild animals</a>. Instead of focusing on the welfare of animals in factory farms, it’s focused on the welfare of free-ranging animals from birds to raccoons to insects. It <a href="https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/research">studies</a> questions like: Which animals are capable of subjective experiences? What is the quality of their lives like in the wild? How can we safely and sustainably help them?</p>

<p>8) <a href="https://www.legalimpactforchickens.org/">Legal Impact for Chickens</a>: This group works to enforce laws against animal cruelty in the US, filing lawsuits for farmed animals and suing companies that violate commitments to animal welfare. The overall strategy is to make it a liability to treat animals cruelly on factory farms. The first lawsuit, in 2022, tackled <a href="https://www.legalimpactforchickens.org/costco">Costco’s executives</a> and the company’s treatment of chickens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">9) <a href="https://www.newrootsinstitute.org/">New Roots Institute</a>: This organization wants to empower young people in the US to end factory farming, so it focuses on education. Its outreach program in schools tries to build critical thinking and highlight connections between factory farming, climate change, and public health. Students have the option to participate in a yearlong fellowship, where they’re trained in organizing and leadership skills.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">10) <a href="https://kafessizturkiye.com/">Çiftlik Hayvanlarını Koruma Derneği</a>: ÇHKD, an organization based in Turkey, is working to achieve three main goals: ban cages from the country’s egg industry, improve welfare standards for farmed fish, and help build the Turkish animal protection movement. Organizations advocating for farmed animals are underfunded in general, but especially so in the Middle East and Africa, so support for groups like ÇHKD — which also goes by Kafessiz Türkiye, Turkish for “Turkey Without Cages” — could go a long way.</p>

<p>11) <a href="https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/">Shrimp Welfare Project</a>: This organization does exactly what its name suggests — it focuses on improving welfare standards for shrimp, which it sees as a neglected yet tractable issue. It does that by raising awareness, doing corporate outreach, and collaborating with producers and retailers. It also runs the Sustainable Shrimp Farmers of India, which helps farmers make life better for shrimp on Indian farms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you donate to one of the charities above, you can be reasonably confident that your money will be used effectively to minimize animal suffering. And if you’re not sure which of them you’d like to donate to, you can give to the&nbsp;<a href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charity-fund/">Recommended Charity Fund</a> and leave it up to ACE to distribute the money based on what their research suggests is most effective at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Is it misguided to worry about animals when so many humans are suffering?</h2>

<p>Americans are increasingly concerned with animal welfare. </p>

<p>A 2015&nbsp;<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/183275/say-animals-rights-people.aspx">Gallup poll</a>&nbsp;found that 62 percent of Americans said animals deserve some legal protections. Another 32 percent — nearly one-third — expressed an even stronger pro-animal stance, saying they believe animals should get the same rights as people. In 2008, only <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/183275/say-animals-rights-people.aspx">25 percent</a> voiced that view.</p>

<p>It seems more and more Americans are coming to see animals as part of our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/4/18285986/robot-animal-nature-expanding-moral-circle-peter-singer">moral circle</a>, the imaginary boundary we draw around those we consider worthy of ethical consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some people, however, react to this with a bout of “whataboutism”: What about urgent human problems like poverty? Underlying this objection is typically a sense that we can’t afford to “waste” compassion on animal suffering, because every bit of caring we devote to that cause means we have less to devote to human suffering.</p>

<p>But as <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/21/20812623/animal-rights-suffering-singer-compassion">Ezra Klein has written</a>, <a href="https://cpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.dartmouth.edu/dist/b/1324/files/2019/06/Park-and-Valentino-HRQ-Animals-are-People-Too.pdf">research</a>&nbsp;from Harvard’s Yon Soo Park and Dartmouth’s Benjamin Valentino showed that concern for human suffering and concern for animal suffering is not zero-sum — in fact, where you find one, you tend to find the other:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>In one half of the study, they used General Social Survey data to see whether people who supported animal rights were likelier to support a variety of human rights, a test of whether abstract compassion is zero-sum. Then they compared how strong animal treatment laws were in individual states to how strong laws were protecting human beings, a test of whether political activism is zero-sum.</p>



<p>The answer, in both cases, is that compassion seems to beget compassion. People who strongly favored government help for the sick “were over 80 percent more likely to support animal rights than those who strongly opposed it,” the authors&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/26/who-supports-animal-rights-heres-what-we-found/">write</a>. The finding held even after controlling for factors like political ideology. Support for animal rights was also correlated — though the size of the effect was smaller — with support for LGBT individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, unauthorized immigrants, and low-income people.</p>



<p>Similarly, states that did the most to protect animal rights also did the most to protect and expand human rights. States with strong laws protecting LGBT residents, strong protections against hate crimes, and inclusive policies for undocumented immigrants were much likelier to have strong protections for animals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question of why these correlations exist is up for debate, but the bottom line is that we’d better hope our society takes action on animal suffering: If it does, we’re more likely to see it taking action on human suffering, too.</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, chances are you care a lot about fighting <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate" data-source="encore">climate change</a>, and that’s great. The climate emergency threatens all of humanity. And although the world has started to make <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/26/magazine/climate-change-warming-world.html">some progress</a> on it, our global response is still extremely lacking.</p>

<p>The trouble is, it can be genuinely hard to figure out how to direct your money wisely if you want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. There’s a glut of environmental organizations out there —&nbsp;but how do you know which are the most impactful? </p>

<p>To help, here’s a<strong> </strong>list of 11 of the most high-impact, cost-effective, and evidence-based organizations. We’re not including bigger-name groups, such as the Environmental Defense Fund, the Nature Conservancy, or the Natural Resources Defense Council, because most big organizations are already relatively well-funded.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The groups we list below seem to be doing something especially<em> </em>promising in the light of criteria that matter for effectiveness: importance, tractability, and neglectedness.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Vox guide to giving</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The holiday season is giving season. This year, Vox is exploring every element of charitable giving —&nbsp;from making the case for donating 10 percent of your income, to recommending specific charities for specific causes, to explaining what you can do to make a difference beyond donations. <a href="https://www.vox.com/charitable-giving">You can find all of our giving guide stories here</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<p>Important targets for change are ones that drive a big portion of global emissions. Tractable problems are ones where we can actually make progress right now. And neglected problems are ones that aren’t already getting a big influx of cash from other sources like the government or <a href="https://www.vox.com/philanthropy" data-source="encore">philanthropy</a>, and could really use money from smaller donors.</p>

<p>Founders Pledge, an organization that guides entrepreneurs committed to donating a portion of their proceeds to effective charities, and Giving Green, a climate charity evaluator, used these criteria to assess climate organizations. Their research informed the list below. As in the <a href="https://www.founderspledge.com/funds/climate-change-fund">Founders Pledge </a>and <a href="https://www.givinggreen.earth/top-climate-change-nonprofit-donations-recommendations">Giving Green</a> recommendations, we’ve<strong> </strong>chosen to look at groups focused on mitigation (tackling the root causes of climate change by reducing emissions) rather than adaptation (decreasing the suffering from the impacts of climate change). Both are important, but the focus here is preventing further catastrophe.</p>

<p>Arguably the best move is to donate not to an individual charity, but to a fund —&nbsp;like the <a href="https://www.founderspledge.com/funds/climate-change-fund">Founders Pledge Climate Change Fund</a> or the <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/giving-green-fund">Giving Green Fund</a>. Experts at those groups pool together donor money and give it out to the charities they deem most effective, right when extra funding is most needed. That can mean making time-sensitive grants to promote the writing of an important report, or stepping in when a charity becomes acutely funding-constrained.</p>

<p>That said, some of us like to be able to decide exactly which charity our money ends up with — maybe because we have especially high confidence in one or two charities relative to the others — rather than letting experts split the cash over a range of different groups.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we’re listing below the individual organizations where your money is likely to have an exceptionally positive impact.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1) Clean Air Task Force</h2>

<p><strong>What it does:</strong> The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.catf.us/">Clean Air Task Force</a>&nbsp;is a US-based non-governmental organization that has been working to reduce <a href="https://www.vox.com/air-quality" data-source="encore">air pollution</a> since its founding in 1996. It led a successful campaign to reduce the pollution caused by coal-fired power plants in the US, helped limit the US power sector’s CO2 emissions, and helped establish regulations of diesel, shipping, and methane emissions. CATF also advocates for the adoption of neglected low- and zero-carbon technologies, from <a href="https://www.catf.us/work/advanced-nuclear-energy/">advanced nuclear power</a> to <a href="https://www.catf.us/work/superhot-rock/">super-hot rock geothermal energy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider donating:</strong> In addition to its seriously impressive record of success and the high quality of its research, CATF does well on the neglectedness criterion: It often concentrates on targeting emissions sources that are neglected by other environmental organizations, and on scaling up deployment of technologies that are crucial for decarbonization, yet passed over by NGOs and governments. For example, it was one of the <a href="https://www.catf.us/timeline/launched-campaign-against-super-pollutants/">first</a> major environmental groups to publicly campaign against overlooked superpollutants like methane.</p>

<p>More recently, CATF has <a href="https://www.catf.us/timeline/expanding-into-europe-africa-and-the-middle-east/">been expanding</a> beyond the US to operate in Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere. <a href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/changing-landscape#:~:text=Regions%20that%20represent%20a%20small%20portion%20of%20future%20emissions">This is crucial</a>: About 35 percent of climate philanthropy goes to the US and about 10 percent to Europe, which together represent only about 15 percent of future emissions, according to Founders Pledge. This is part of why Founders Pledge is supporting CATF’s efforts to globalize and recommends giving to that organization. CATF is also one of Giving Green’s top picks. </p>

<p>You can donate to CATF <a href="https://www.catf.us/donate/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2) Future Cleantech Architects</h2>

<p><strong>What it does:</strong> This Germany-based organization is <em>relatively</em> young. Its aim is to promote innovation in Europe’s hard-to-decarbonize sectors by running key programs in, for example, zero-carbon fuels, industry, and carbon removal technologies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider donating: </strong>You might be wondering if this kind of innovation really meets the “neglectedness” criterion —&nbsp;don’t we already have a lot of innovation? In the US, yes. But in Europe, this kind of organization is much rarer. And according to Founders Pledge, it’s already exceeded expectations at improving the European climate policy response. Most notably, it has helped shape key legislation at the EU level and advised policymakers on how to get the most bang for their buck when supporting research and development for clean energy&nbsp;tech. As of 2024, Giving Green recommends this organization, too.</p>

<p>You can donate to Future Cleantech Architects <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/future-cleantech-architects">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3) Good Food Institute</h2>

<p><strong>What it does:</strong> The Good Food Institute works to make alternative proteins (think plant-based burgers) competitive with conventional proteins like beef, which could help reduce livestock consumption. It engages in scientific research, industry partnerships, and government advocacy that improves the odds of alternative proteins going mainstream.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider donating: </strong>Raising animals for meat is responsible for at least 10 percent of global emissions. These animals belch the superpollutant methane. Plus, we humans tend to deforest a lot of land for them to graze on, even though we all know the world needs more trees, not less. Yet there hasn’t been very much government effort to substantially cut agricultural emissions. Giving Green recommends the Good Food Institute because of its potential to help with that,<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.givinggreen.earth/mitigation-research/good-food-institute%3A-recommendation" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.givinggreen.earth/mitigation-research/good-food-institute%3A-recommendation">noting</a>, “GFI added significant wins to its track record in 2024. Highlights include its partnership with the Bezos Earth Fund to unlock $100 million of funding for three global alternative protein research centers, engagement with Singapore’s Islamic council on the first-ever authoritative ruling that cultivated meat can be halal, and opening GFI’s newest office in Japan.” </p>

<p>You can donate to the Good Food Institute <a href="https://gfi.org/the-good-food-future/?utm_source=web&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=GivingGreen">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4) Industrious Labs</h2>

<p><strong>What it does:</strong> This is a newish organization with one clear goal: helping global “heavy industry” —&nbsp;think steel and cement —&nbsp;go green. Through advocacy, <a href="https://industriouslabs.org/#work">Industrious Labs</a> pushes corporations to make low-carbon commitments, and pushes governments to make sure that regulations and public funding are in place to accelerate the transition.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider donating: </strong>Steel and cement are “can’t live with ’em, can’t live without ’em” kind of industries. We need them to build, yet they account for one-third of greenhouse gas emissions. And these industries are bizarrely neglected by both government and philanthropy. Helping them go green could make a big difference, which is why Giving Green recommends Industrious Labs.</p>

<p>You can donate to Industrious Labs <a href="https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/industrious-labs">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5) DEPLOY/US</h2>

<p><strong>What it does: </strong>This nonpartisan nonprofit works with American conservatives — yes, you read that right — to enact decarbonization policies, with the goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. DEPLOY/US partners with philanthropic, business, military, faith, youth, policy, and grassroots organizations to shape a decarbonization strategy and generate policy change.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider donating: </strong>In case you haven’t heard of the <a href="https://www.philanthropy.com/article/conservatives-care-about-the-climate-too-philanthropy-should-stop-ignoring-them">eco-right</a>, it’s important to know that there are genuine right-of-center climate groups that want to build support for decarbonization based on conservative principles. These groups have a crucial role to play; they can weaken political polarization around climate and increase Republican support for bold decarbonization policies,<strong> </strong>which will be especially important with Republicans moving into the White House soon. Right now, these groups are incredibly underfunded. Founders Pledge recommends donating to DEPLOY/US because it’s uniquely positioned to insulate climate policy against the shifting winds of politics.</p>

<p>You can donate to DEPLOY/US <a href="https://www.deployus.org/support-our-work">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6) Energy for Growth Hub</h2>

<p><strong>What it does:</strong> Founded by <a href="https://energyforgrowth.org/team/todd-moss/">Todd Moss</a>&nbsp;in 2013, Energy for Growth Hub aims to make electricity reliable and affordable for everyone. The organization hopes to end energy poverty through climate-friendly solutions.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider donating: </strong>While Energy for Growth Hub is not a strictly climate-focused organization —&nbsp;ending energy poverty is its main goal — it’s still a leader in the clean energy space. The organization will use your donation to fund projects that produce insight for companies and policymakers on how to create the energy-rich, climate-friendly future they’re dreaming of.</p>

<p>You can donate to Energy for Growth Hub <a href="http://info@energyforgrowth.org/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">7) Project InnerSpace</h2>

<p><strong>What it does:</strong> This US-based nonprofit hopes to unlock the power of heat — geothermal energy — lying beneath the Earth’s surface. Launched in 2022, Project InnerSpace seeks to expand global access to carbon-free heat and electricity, particularly to populations in the Global South. The organization maps geothermal resources and identifies geothermal projects in need of further funding.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider donating: </strong>Most geothermal power plants are located in places where geothermal energy is close to the Earth’s surface. Project InnerSpace will use your donation to better map geothermal energy hot spots and to drive geothermal energy costs down.</p>

<p>You can donate to Project InnerSpace&nbsp;<a href="https://projectinnerspace.org/faq/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">8) Opportunity Green</h2>

<p><strong>What it does: </strong>Opportunity Green aims to cut aviation and maritime shipping emissions through targeted regulation and policy initiatives. The UK-based nonprofit was founded in 2021, and since then has aimed to encourage private sector adoption of clean energy alternatives.</p>

<p><strong>Why you should consider donating: </strong>As a newer organization, Opportunity Green is still growing and could use your donation to increase its staff, including bringing on senior lawyers who can help fight for its proposed policy initiatives. “We are especially excited about Opportunity Green’s efforts to elevate climate-vulnerable countries in policy discussions, as we think this could improve the inclusivity of the process and the ambition level of policies,” Giving Green <a href="https://www.givinggreen.earth/mitigation-research/opportunity-green%3A-recommendation">notes</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can donate to Opportunity Green <a href="https://www.opportunitygreen.org/donate">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">9) Carbon-Free Europe</h2>

<p><strong>What it does: </strong>This European initiative researches the tradeoffs of various net-zero strategies and advocates for technology-inclusive climate policy to get governments on track to meet decarbonization goals by 2050.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why you should consider donating: </strong>With a Republican trifecta in power, climate policy in the United States is likely to be stunted to some degree in the coming years. Europe is a key area for global decarbonization efforts, and while recent European Parliamentary elections have also shifted towards the right, diversifying where your money goes can help ensure progress is made and defended in other critical regions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.carbonfreeeurope.org/">CFE</a> in particular also produces an <a href="https://www.carbonfreeeurope.org/modelling">Annual Decarbonization Perspective</a>, which analyzes the costs of different net-zero emission strategies across the EU and the UK — an insightful tool policymakers can use to make evidence-based decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can donate to Carbon-Free Europe by clicking <a href="https://www.thirdway.org/donate">here</a> and designating “Carbon-Free Europe.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">10) Quantified Carbon</h2>

<p><strong>What it does: </strong><a href="https://www.quantifiedcarbon.com/">Quantified Carbon</a> is an international consultancy firm that supplies analysis and solutions towards decarbonization, with a particular expertise in energy systems and industrial transitions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why you should consider donating: </strong>The firm leads and manages <a href="https://www.repower.world/">Repower</a>, an initiative that is working on repowering existing coal plants. They’re working with local teams in places where this work is needed most (like parts of Asia where coal-powered units have been built in recent years), and providing a techno-economic analysis to help retrofit these plants with clean heat sources. Founders Pledge recommends donating to Quantified Carbon for this critical work on transitions in the energy industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can donate to Quantified Carbon <a href="http://repower.world/donate">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">11) WePlanet</h2>

<p><strong>What it does: </strong><a href="https://www.weplanet.org/">WePlanet</a> is a young, international grassroots organization that’s building support for nuclear energy, gene-edited crops, and lab-grown meat, all of which are nontraditional priorities for the climate movement space.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Why you should consider donating: </strong>Making progress relies in large part on the strength and persuasion of on-the-ground, people-led movements, especially for a challenge as great as climate change — and WePlanet is doing that work. In just a few years, they’ve put down roots across four continents, which explains why Founders Pledge recommends donating to WePlanet for their savviness in movement-building. They also focus on climate solutions that the environmental movement has historically turned away from, meaning they’re working on ideas that have long been neglected. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can donate to WePlanet <a href="https://www.weplanet.org/donate">here</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to think about donating to grassroots climate activism</h2>

<p>The past several<strong> </strong>years have seen an explosion of grassroots activism groups focused on climate —&nbsp;from Greta Thunberg’s <a href="https://fridaysforfuture.org/">Fridays for Future</a> to the <a href="https://www.sunrisemovement.org/">Sunrise Movement</a> to <a href="https://rebellion.global/">Extinction Rebellion</a>. Activism is an important piece of the climate puzzle; it can help change public opinion and policy, including by shifting the <a href="https://conceptually.org/concepts/overton-window">Overton window</a>, the range of policies that seem possible.</p>

<p>Social change is not an exact science, and the challenges in measuring a social movement’s effectiveness are&nbsp;<a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__drive.google.com_file_d_1ZfQPprLLO8485v-2D3wnXLX7cit8AnwZCg_view-3Fusp-3Dsharing&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;r=kV_pE3Fk2uPZQgQK0cNHqCollNEYBT3dTA9DKAIWwEw&amp;m=-5HFDeJj-I7LLnsIRcySw2ypzvTBY8LG6knVBERt5c-_81vTcuXPXHOuuPmmNhZx&amp;s=qGZpXBgYsIFCSDykI38c4WxmhlT4uMkPRiTkbkD_3eQ&amp;e=">well documented</a>. While it would be helpful to have more concrete data on the impact of activist groups, it may also be shortsighted to ignore movement-building for that reason.    </p>

<p>Bill McKibben, co-founder of <a href="http://350.org/">350.org</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/11/12/20910176/billionaire-philanthropy-charity-climate-change">told Vox</a> that building the climate movement is crucial because although we’ve already got some good mitigation solutions, we’re not deploying them fast enough. “That’s the ongoing power of the fossil fuel industry at work. The only way to break that power and change the politics of climate is to build a countervailing power,” he said in 2019. “Our job — and it’s the key job — is to change the zeitgeist, people’s sense of what’s normal and natural and obvious. If we do that, all else will follow.”</p>

<p>Of course, some activist groups are more effective than others. And broadly speaking, US climate activist groups are in a better funding situation than they were a couple years ago.</p>

<p>In 2020, Giving Green recommended giving to Sunrise Movement Education Fund — the 501(c3) arm of Sunrise —&nbsp;which was highly effective leading up to the 2020 US elections and helped influence the Biden administration’s climate plan. However, Giving Green <a href="https://www.givinggreen.earth/post/giving-green-s-mistakes#viewer-ft3mk">stopped recommending</a> the organization in 2021, for a few reasons. One was that Sunrise is better funded than it used to be. Another was that post-2020, Sunrise didn’t play a key role in pushing for new climate bills.</p>

<p>“Overall, our take on grassroots activism is that it has huge potential to be cost-effective, and we indeed think that grassroots movements like Sunrise have had really meaningful effects in the past,” Dan&nbsp;Stein, the director of Giving Green,&nbsp;told Vox. But, he added, “It takes a unique combination of timing, organization, and connection to policy to have an impactful grassroots movement.”</p>

<p>One umbrella charity that’s more bullish on the ongoing impact of activism is the <a href="https://climateemergencyfund.org/">Climate Emergency Fund</a>. It was founded in 2019 with the goal of quickly regranting money to groups engaged in climate protest around the globe. Its founders <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2023/9/21/23879312/climate-protests-activism-un-climate-week">believe that street protest</a> is crucially important to climate politics and neglected in environmental philanthropy. Grantees include Just Stop Oil, the group that made international headlines for <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23414590/just-stop-oil-van-gogh-sunflowers-protest-climate-change">throwing soup</a> on a protected, glassed-in Van Gogh painting, and Extinction Rebellion, an activist movement that uses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/20/21028407/extinction-rebellion-climate-change-nonviolent-civil-disobedience">nonviolent civil disobedience</a> like filling the streets and blocking intersections to demand that governments do more on climate.</p>

<p>If you’re skeptical that street protest can make a difference, consider <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/18/11450126/nonviolence-2016-elections">Harvard political scientist Erica Chenoweth’s research</a>. She’s found that if you want to achieve systemic social change, you need to mobilize&nbsp;<a href="https://extinctionrebellion.uk/the-truth/about-us/">3.5 percent</a>&nbsp;of the population, a finding that helped inspire Extinction Rebellion. And more recent <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/protest_movements_could_be_more_effective_than_the_best_charities">research</a> from the nonprofit Social Change Lab suggests that, in the past, groups like Sunrise and Extinction Rebellion may have cost-effectively helped to win policy changes (in the US and UK, respectively) that avert carbon emissions.</p>

<p>But the words “in the past”<em> </em>are doing a lot of work here: While early-stage social movement incubation might be cost-effective, it’s unclear<strong> </strong>whether it’s as cost-effective to give to an activist group once it’s already achieved national attention.<strong> </strong>The same research <a href="https://www.socialchangelab.org/_files/ugd/503ba4_052959e2ee8d4924934b7efe3916981e.pdf">notes</a> that in countries with existing high levels of climate concern, broadly trying to increase that concern may be less effective than in previous years; now, it might be more promising to focus on climate advocacy in countries with much lower baseline support for this issue.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Aside from donating, there are many other ways you can help</h2>

<p>There are plenty of ways to use your skills to tackle the climate emergency.&nbsp;And many don’t cost a cent.</p>

<p>If you’re a writer or artist, you can use your talents to convey a message that will resonate with people. If you’re a religious leader, you can give a sermon about climate and run a collection drive to support one of the groups above. If you’re a teacher, you can discuss this issue with your students, who may influence their parents. If you’re a good talker, you can go out canvassing for a politician you believe will make the right choices on climate.</p>

<p>If you’re, well, any human being, you can consume less. You can reduce your energy use, <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/23951307/buy-less-stuff">how much stuff you buy</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22842911/how-to-eat-less-meat-newsletter-course">how much meat you consume</a>.&nbsp;Individual action alone won’t move the needle that much — real change on the part of governments and corporations is key —&nbsp;but your actions can influence others and ripple out to shift social norms, and keep you feeling motivated rather than resigned to climate despair.<strong> </strong></p>

<p>You can, of course, also volunteer with an activist group&nbsp;and put your body in the street to nonviolently disrupt business as usual and demand change.</p>

<p>The point is that activism comes in many forms. It’s worth taking some time to think about which one (or ones) will allow you, with your unique capacities and constraints, to have the biggest positive impact. But at the end of the day, don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good: It’s best to pick something that seems doable and get to work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden on Sunday, just weeks before he leaves the White House and despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/389206/hunter-biden-pardon-joe-biden-democrats-response">previously promising not to do so</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden said in a statement announcing the pardon that his son had been “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted” and that his political opponents had undertaken an “effort to break Hunter,” suggesting that the Justice Department under a second Trump administration would continue to go after him. Hunter Biden was convicted in two separate federal cases involving handgun and tax-related charges and was awaiting sentencing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/01/statement-from-president-joe-biden-11/">full and unconditional pardon</a>” covers an 11-year period ending on December 1 and is “not limited to all offenses charged or prosecuted.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,” Biden said in the statement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republicans, unsurprisingly, have criticized the decision, but so, too, have some of Biden’s fellow Democrats. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) <a href="https://x.com/SenatorBennet/status/1863623197788160041">called</a> the pardon a decision to “<a href="https://x.com/SenatorBennet/status/1863623197788160041">put personal interest ahead of duty</a>” that “further erodes Americans’ faith that the justice system is fair and equal for all,” and Rep. Greg Landsman (D-Ohio) said <a href="https://x.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1863591569363804388">it was “a setback”</a> for those who want to “believe in public service again.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is Hunter Biden, and what did he do?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hunter Biden, 54, is the president’s only living son and the only family member of a sitting president to be convicted of federal crimes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In June, a Delaware jury <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/354731/hunter-biden-guilty-gun-charges">convicted him</a> on three charges related to misrepresenting his illegal drug use on a form he submitted while purchasing a handgun in 2018, when he was addicted to drugs. He had initially struck a plea deal with prosecutors that later fell apart, and instead, they brought the gun charges to trial — a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/15/us/politics/hunter-biden-gun-charges.html">rare occurrence</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In September, Biden also pled guilty to nine charges related to underpaying taxes between 2016 and 2019, including filing a false tax return and tax evasion.&nbsp;He would have faced up to 25 years in prison for the gun conviction and 17 years for the tax conviction, though likely would have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/01/us/politics/hunter-biden-crimes.html">only been sentenced for a fraction of that time</a>, totaling under five years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neither case involved longstanding probes into Biden’s business dealings, which Republicans have attempted to link to his father. But it’s possible further charges could have been brought against him had he not been pardoned.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is a presidential pardon?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the Constitution, the president has the power to “grant Reprieves and Pardons.” A full pardon reverses a past criminal conviction (or, in Hunter Biden’s case, all of them within a certain span of time, as well as the possibility of facing legal jeopardy for as-of-yet-unprosecuted crimes) and its consequences, including restoring the right to vote, hold office, and sit on a jury, if lost as a consequence of the conviction. Presidents can also grant clemency to those convicted of federal crimes, reducing their sentences while leaving convictions in place. This authority, however, is not limitless.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the president can grant an unlimited number of pardons, they can only do so for federal criminal offenses, not state crimes or civil liability. There are also <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/the-presidential-pardon-power-explained/">other restrictions</a> on the president’s pardon powers: Federal courts have found that pardons must advance “public welfare”; they cannot be used to infringe on constitutional rights, to obstruct justice, or as bribes; and they must not interfere with the president’s duty to “<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-S3-3-1/ALDE_00001160/">take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed</a>” by encouraging future lawbreaking.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Have presidents pardoned their family before?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Presidents have pardoned members of their family before, though it’s relatively uncommon. Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, who <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/12/02/nx-s1-5213251/hunter-biden-presidential-pardon-explained">pleaded guilty</a> to drug charges in 1985. Trump pardoned his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s father, Charles Kushner, who he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/30/politics/charles-kushner-france-ambassador-trump/index.html">recently appointed as the US ambassador to France</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also pardoned <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2023/trump-pardon-power-2024-benefit/?itid=hp-top-table-main_p001_f001">dozens of people</a> shortly before leaving office in his first term who later went on to endorse him or financially support his 2024 campaign, including his former White House chief strategist Steven Bannon, former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, his former campaign chair Paul Manafort, and his former political consultant Roger Stone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1974, Gerald Ford notably pardoned his predecessor, Richard Nixon, after the Watergate scandal, a decision he attributed to the need to allow the country to move past the scandal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden’s controversial decision to pardon his son may pave the way for future presidents — Trump included — to abuse their pardon powers. Biden’s pardon is incredibly broad, covering over a decade in which his son could have potentially committed crimes that have not even been charged yet, and in that sense, is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/02/hunter-biden-presidential-pardon-comparisons/">unprecedented</a>. Typically, presidents pardon specific crimes or any crimes related to a particular event. This one amounts to blanket amnesty.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Will Trump pardon anyone when he takes office?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has previously claimed he has an “<a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hunter-biden-donald-trump-pardon-2028-1994233">absolute right</a>” to pardon himself, a statement that has <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/hunter-biden-donald-trump-pardon-2028-1994233">divided legal scholars</a>. It’s unclear if he will test that theory, however; while he has <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/11/donald-trump-legal-cases-charges/675531/">34 felony convictions</a> to his name for falsifying business records, those lie outside his pardon power in New York state court. He also faces multiple federal criminal investigations, but following Trump’s reelection, special counsel Jack Smith and the Justice Department said they would drop cases against him for trying to overturn the 2020 election and mishandling classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conservative majority on the Supreme Court has suggested it might side with Trump if he pardons himself. In a ruling earlier this year, it found that presidents have immunity from prosecution for official acts under their &#8220;exclusive sphere of constitutional authority.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has also suggested he would pardon those behind the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol. More than <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/prosecution-jan-6-capitol-riot-60-minutes/">1,000 people</a> have been convicted for their involvement, including on charges of seditious conspiracy and assaulting law enforcement officers, and hundreds of cases are still pending. Trump has previously, baselessly, called them “hostages” and said he would be &#8220;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-january-6-defendants-first-acts-reelected/">inclined to pardon many of them</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past presidents have pardoned insurrectionists before, but not recently. Previous cases include during the 1794 Whiskey Rebellion and the Philippine-American War at the turn of the 20th century, but in those cases, the pardons were seen as an opportunity to quell further unrest. Potential Trump pardons for January 6 insurrectionists could have the opposite effect; by allowing his supporters to escape consequences for committing politically motivated violence, it could encourage further such violence on his behalf.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Could the pardon power be reformed?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some Democrats have raised the possibility of putting guardrails on the president’s pardon power to prevent future abuses in the wake of Biden’s decision. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5017923-gerry-connolly-hunter-biden-pardon/">indicated</a> Monday that he would support reforms: “At the very least, we’ve got to circumscribe it so that you don’t get to pardon relatives, even if you believe passionately that they’re innocent or their cause is just,” he said on CNN.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other Democrats have <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/4913189-trump-pardon-power-reform/">previously suggested</a> that not only a president’s family members, but members of their administrations or campaign staff and anyone who commits a crime to further the president’s personal interests should not be eligible for a pardon. Though that might already be beyond the scope of the president’s pardon powers, making that prohibition explicit would help prevent abuse, especially since courts may be reluctant to intervene.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, such reforms would require a constitutional amendment. Two-thirds of both chambers of Congress would have to approve it, which seems unlikely at such a moment of political polarization.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How could Biden still use his pardon powers?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With under two months left in office, Biden may still issue further pardons. It’s traditional for presidents to issue grants of executive clemency before leaving office, and advocates have urged Biden to do so in a number of cases. Perhaps most prominently, Biden still has time to grant clemency to the<a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/biden-contemplates-federal-commutation-requests"> 40 men currently on federal death row</a>, who otherwise would face the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/inside-trump-and-barrs-last-minute-killing-spree">possibility of execution</a> under a second Trump administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He could also use the power to alleviate the harms of mass incarceration, as <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25354946-2024-11-20-letter-to-president-biden-on-clemency?responsive=1&amp;title=1">dozens of lawmakers</a> have recently urged him. Specifically, they asked Biden to help “elderly and chronically ill,” “people with unjustified sentencing disparities,” and “women who were punished for defending themselves against their abusers” who are currently in prison, including many who do not pose a public safety threat and who have been separated from their families.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.justice.gov/pardon/clemency-statistics">Biden has granted 25 pardons and 132 commutations</a> of sentences during his time in office, according to Department of Justice data. That puts him behind other recent Democratic presidents, including Barack Obama, who issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations during two terms. However, Obama issued hundreds of clemency actions on his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/23/13731448/obama-pardon-clemency-commutation">last day in office</a>, and Biden could do the same — on Monday, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre <a href="https://x.com/ToluseO/status/1863619155427017125">told reporters</a> that more pardons will be forthcoming.</p>

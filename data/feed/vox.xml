<p class="has-text-align-none">Former President Donald Trump used to be persona non grata in Silicon Valley.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nearly-all-of-silicon-valleys-political-dollars-are-going-to-hillary-clinton/">Nearly all of the dollars</a> spent by Silicon Valley elites in 2016 went to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. In 2020, those elites <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nearly-all-of-silicon-valleys-political-dollars-are-going-to-hillary-clinton/">spent even more</a> to defeat Trump. The few who supported Trump that year — such as venture capitalist Peter Thiel, the co-founder of Paypal and Palantir — <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/9/17/20869679/donald-trump-silicon-valley-fundraiser-2020">did so knowing they were standing on a third rail</a>, and many did not speak openly about it for fear of backlash that could hurt their businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Something has changed since the last election cycle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, the Wall Street Journal reported that Elon Musk, who <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/elon-musk-says-he-fully-endorses-tough-trump-posts-photo-2024-07-13/">endorsed Trump Saturday</a> after the assassination attempt against him, planned to send <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/elon-musk-has-said-he-is-committing-around-45-million-a-month-to-a-new-pro-trump-super-pac-dda53823">$45 million a month</a> to a pro-Trump super PAC starting in July. (Musk appeared to push back on the reporting with a <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1813097084595163643">meme on X</a> reading: “FAKE GNUS.”) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The prominent tech investor and entrepreneur David Sacks — who previously said that Trump should be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/venture-capitalist-david-sacks-is-all-in-on-donald-trump">disqualified from office</a> for his actions surrounding the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol — has now endorsed the former president. Sacks <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/15/david-sacks-speech-rnc/74411040007/">gave a speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee</a> on Monday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of Silicon Valley’s largest venture capital firms, Andreessen Horowitz, has also recently indicated that it will <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/marc-andreessen-ben-horowitz-say-they-plan-to-donate-to-trump-pac">donate large amounts</a> to PACs supporting Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Blue Wall of tech is crumbling before our very eyes,” Ryan Selkis, the founder and CEO of the crypto research firm Messari, <a href="https://x.com/twobitidiot/status/1798055006618472629">wrote on X</a> last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Selkis’s assessment might not be entirely true. By most indications, Silicon Valley is still overwhelmingly Democratic. But tech elites who are supporting Trump seem to be more comfortable doing so openly and without fear of being ostracized for it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why some Silicon Valley leaders are backing Trump</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silicon Valley is not undergoing a seismic rightward shift.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of 2022, <a href="https://siliconvalleyindicators.org/data/governance/civic-engagement/partisan-affiliation/percentage-of-registered-voters-by-political-party/">a little over half of voters</a> in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties (which encompass Silicon Valley) were registered Democrats. That share hasn’t changed much since the 1970s. The share of voters with no party preference has increased, while the share of Republican voters shrank to about 15 percent in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silicon Valley venture capitalists also seem to be supporting Democrats at a higher-than-average rate compared to the last 10 election cycles. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-crypto-trump-biden-debate/">A recent Wired analysis</a> found that Democrats received $2 for every dollar that Republicans received from the 20 firms that, together with their employees, made the most political contributions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That suggests Silicon Valley’s political views are still largely consistent with a <a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/working-papers/predispositions-political-behavior-american-economic-elites">2017 study</a> indicating that wealthy technologists supported many liberal policies: redistribution of wealth, abortion, gay rights, immigration, and more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there was one issue on which, even in 2017, they chafed with Democrats: They <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/technology/silicon-valley-politics.html">didn’t want the government to interfere</a> in the operation of their businesses. And that might be driving at least some of the support for Trump among Silicon Valley elites this election cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden has taken a hardline approach against Big Tech that might be perceived by some donors as overreach. The administration has filed sweeping antitrust lawsuits against four major tech companies: <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2024/3/21/24108155/apple-new-antitrust-lawsuit-iphone-monopoly">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/02/technology/google-antitrust-trial-closing-arguments.html">Google</a> (now known as Alphabet), <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/19/technology/ftc-facebook-antitrust.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-big-tech&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_levelup_swipe_recirc">Meta</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/03/technology/google-apple-amazon-meta-antitrust.html">Amazon</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the downfall of the crypto exchange FTX and its <a href="https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/2024/3/28/24114058/sam-bankman-fried-sbf-ftx-conviction-sentence-date">founder Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the Biden administration has also <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/31/state-of-crypto-regulation-in-2023-eu-laws-approved-but-us-is-top-cop.html">cracked down on crypto</a>, filing lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance and trying to advance more stringent regulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s new running mate, J.D. Vance, seems to broadly share the Biden administration’s philosophy: he has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24199314/jd-vance-donald-trump-vp-antitrust-big-tech-ftc-lina-khan-elizabeth-warren-google">applauded Lina Khan</a>, the head of the Federal Trade Commission behind the antitrust suits against Big Tech. It’s not clear whether he will temper that position now that he’s running for vice president, but some tech titans seem to be supporting the Republican ticket anyway.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Andreessen Horowitz had previously suggested that government regulation would determine which party receives their dollars. “We are non-partisan, one-issue voters: If a candidate supports an optimistic technology-enabled future, we are for them. If they want to choke off important technologies, we are against them,” the <a href="https://a16z.com/politics-and-the-future/">firm announced</a> in December.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_sNclEgQZQ">video posted on Tuesday</a>, founders Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz further explained why their firm would be supporting Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The future of our business, the future of &#8230; new technology, and the future of America is literally at stake,” Horowitz said, acknowledging that he would be angering friends and family. “We think Donald Trump is actually the right choice.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Crypto leaders, who have for years <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/05/25/crypto-lobbying-politics-washington/">poured money</a> into the fight against further regulation of the industry, have also contributed <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/silicon-valley-crypto-trump-biden-debate/">more heavily</a> to Republicans. The crypto PAC Stand With Crypto has not issued an endorsement in the presidential race but has identified Trump and Robert F. Kennedy as <a href="https://www.standwithcrypto.org/races">better options</a> than Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond regulation, it seems that some Silicon Valley billionaires are becoming more vocal in their support of Trump just because they can without suffering boycotts or lots of bad press. For instance, Musk has always been a bit of a contrarian but seems to have taken on a more politically active presence online since he bought Twitter and renamed it X. And while his stance may have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-pitches-advertisers-on-a-return-to-x-months-after-telling-some-to-f-themselves-532d2745">cost him users and advertisers</a> early in his X tenure, his endorsement of Trump has yet to be met with a similar backlash.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Biden is on the back foot on fundraising</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The support Trump is receiving from a few wealthy patrons in Silicon Valley should nevertheless worry the Biden campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/21/trump-overtakes-biden-campaign-fundraising-00164384">last campaign finance reports</a> through the end of May, Trump had surpassed Biden in cash on hand. Trump had $116.6 million in his campaign coffers compared to Biden’s $91.6 million.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That advantage has likely only grown in the months since. Biden has reportedly <a href="http://v">struggled with fundraising</a> since his disastrous debate performance last month. Some donors think he should drop out and have promised to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/us/politics/biden-donors-money.html">suspend donations to Democrats</a> until he does so; others have paused contributions while they wait for assurance that he will not be replaced with another Democratic candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-fundraising-assassination-attempt-1925137">started fundraising off of the assassination attempt</a> against him. His campaign website <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/14/trump-campaign-website-bloody-fist-pump-photo/74404529007/">redirected</a> to a photo of him punching the air with blood on his face at the campaign rally where he was shot in the ear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Musk is indeed planning to contribute tens of millions to Trump’s campaign monthly through the election, it’s hard to see how Biden can keep up.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story is an excerpt from </em><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/zack-beauchamp/the-reactionary-spirit/9781541704411/">The Reactionary Spirit: How America’s Most Insidious Political Tradition Swept the World</a> <em>by Zack Beauchamp. Copyright 2024. Available from <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/imprint/publicaffairs/">PublicAffairs</a>, an imprint of Hachette Book Group, Inc.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In April 1945, a young man named David Rubin was about to die.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Jewish capmaker from a small town he called Pruzana, today known as Pruzhany in Belarus, Rubin had managed to survive the nightmare of Auschwitz for two years. Fearing the Allied advance, SS soldiers moved Rubin and 1,620 others to Buchenwald, a concentration camp in central Germany, and from there on a death march south into Bavaria.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After about two days of torture, they entered a small town outside Munich called Ergoldsbach. A group of regular German army soldiers were in the town, lounging in the street with their vehicles. Rubin yelled, “Look, look!” to create a distraction, and quickly slid under a tank. He stayed there until the SS guards had gone. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the next two weeks, Rubin lived on scraps scrounged up by a friendly Polish worker; at one point, he hid from German soldiers in a pile of dry dung on a local farm. When the American army liberated the town at the end of the month, a soldier from Chicago found him lying in a street, unable to move his legs. Seeing Rubin’s&nbsp;Auschwitz tattoo on his arm, the soldier carried him to a hospital and ordered the Germans to take care of him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once he recovered, Rubin became the leader of the small community of Jewish survivors stranded in Ergoldsbach. He met an American who worked for the US government’s refugee aid branch. The American tracked down a cousin of Rubin’s in the United States, a connection that eventually helped Rubin get permission to immigrate. About four years later, he and his new wife, Anita, also a Holocaust survivor, crossed the Atlantic. They settled near David’s family in Philadelphia, where their child was born — my mother, Ruth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I learned the details of David’s extraordinary story in 2011, six years after his death, thanks to a German scholar named Gerhard Strasser. Strasser had been working with residents of Ergoldsbach to document the history of the town during the Holocaust and invited our family to attend a ceremony presenting some of the findings. What I remember from that trip, more than anything else, are the children.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Students at a local school had been assigned projects on Ergoldsbach’s Holocaust history, including researching and writing short presentations on Jewish survivors. This wasn’t just a normal school assignment; people from around the town came to watch their children recite stories of what had happened. In the audience, I waited anxiously to hear my grandfather’s name. Eventually, a German child stood up and told the class about David Rubin’s improbable survival and rise to leadership among the survivors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was not merely a commemoration; it was repentance. In Ergoldsbach, I felt the weight Germans had put on themselves — and felt moved, as a Jew, that they still cared.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Americans have long clashed over our country’s cruel and bigoted past, Germans have undertaken one of the most thoroughgoing efforts of any nation on the planet to reckon with their history. Germany, perhaps more than any other country, has attempted to pull out by the roots its homegrown variant of the reactionary spirit — the tendency of opponents of social change to choose hierarchy over democracy, trying to constrain or even topple democracy to protect hierarchies of wealth and status.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;The Nazis were born out of disgust with post-World War I Weimar democracy, led by men furious about both the new government’s weakness and acceptance of the Jewish minority into German society. After Nazism brought Germany to ruin, preventing a reactionary resurgence became one of the central goals of the country’s subsequent leaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it’s all the more extraordinary that in the past few years, Germany’s far right has been on the rise.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2015, at the peak of the global refugee crisis, German chancellor Angela Merkel announced an open-door policy for those fleeing violence in Syria and elsewhere. In response, the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party, a Euroskeptic faction without a single seat in Parliament, morphed into a virulently xenophobic force calling for Germany to slam Merkel’s open door shut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2017’s national elections, AfD won 94 seats in the Bundestag, turning it into Germany’s third-largest political party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Opposing the country’s approach to the migration policy did not, in and of itself, make AfD a threat to German democracy. But over time the party’s behavior has become more and more troubling.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, AfD supporters participated in an attempted storming of the German capitol building, the Bundestag, in a protest over Covid-19 restrictions. In December 2022, German police busted an armed cell that was plotting to forcibly install a minor noble as Germany’s new kaiser. One of the coup plotters was a former AfD member of Parliament who was serving in a minor party leadership role at the time of her arrest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In February 2023, the executive vice president of the International Auschwitz Committee — a Berlin-based anti-hate group founded by Holocaust survivors — compared the party to the Nazis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet AfD’s rise has continued. Politico Europe’s average of German polls shows that, between July 2022 and 2023, the party’s nationwide support nearly doubled — going from 11 percent to 20 percent. By early 2024, AfD was solidly the second-most popular party in Germany; it won a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/world/europe/germany-afd-eu-election.html">new record vote share</a> in June’s European Parliament election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The threat AfD poses to German democracy is, at least to some extent, contained by the German multiparty system, in which every mainstream party has so far refused to consider forming a national governing coalition with the AfD.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But its rise illustrates something vitally important: That Germany, of all countries, could fail to prevent a surge in reactionary antidemocratic politics suggests there’s something eternal and enduring about the reactionary spirit. And there is something about our current time period that makes it especially likely to flourish — not just in Germany, but around the world.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political scientists often separate the rise of democracy into three broad waves.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first dates from the early 19th century to the years immediately following World War I. The second begins immediately after World War II, defined by the rebirth of democracy in western Europe and its emergence in a handful of postcolonial states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This would soon be eclipsed by a massive third wave beginning in the 1970s and lasting for somewhere around 40 years. During this period, dictatorships of both the right and the left fell almost everywhere: Latin America, East Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Eurasian countries of the former Eastern Bloc. By the turn of the century, roughly half of all countries around the world were democracies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democracy seems so normal, from a contemporary perspective, that it’s easy to lose sight of just how stunning this transformation was. Some variant of authoritarianism has been the default setting of human government for thousands of years. But in a little more than half a century, democracy went from nearly extinct — just 12 democracies survived the Second World War — to globally dominant. No single political system had ever conquered the entire planet so rapidly or so thoroughly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, it appeared that the 20th-century triumph of democracy was complete. Having defeated fascism, its rival on the right, and communism, its rival on the left, Western-style liberal democracy truly faced no challenger. Its spread around the globe seemed assured.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And for a few years, it was. The 1990s saw some of the most significant activity of democracy’s third wave, including across nearly all of Eastern Europe. Former communist states and Soviet republics — like Czechia, Hungary, and Estonia—democratized with remarkable speed. In some countries, the new democratic systems appeared to be fully stable in less than a decade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In ideological terms, the world appeared mostly Americanized in the sense that democracy was the barely contested benchmark by which governments were measured. Culturally and locally specific antidemocratic ideologies remained influential in countries like China and Iran. But those governments did not present any kind of plausible or attractive alternative vision for most people around the world. On the whole, the language of democracy — human rights, elections, free speech, individual autonomy — became the assumed argot of global politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was during this time that the phrase &#8220;end of history&#8221; entered the lexicon, thanks to a 1989 essay and subsequent book by political theorist Francis Fukuyama. Fukuyama argued that liberal democracy was the ultimate stage in the evolution of society. Fundamental forces in history, including deep human desires for recognition and equality, had buoyed it to global dominance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fukuyama did not claim that this state of affairs would necessarily last forever. Instead, he predicted, the very triumph of the system contained the seeds of a future crisis. “No regime — no ‘socioeconomic system’ — is able to satisfy all men in all places. This includes liberal democracy,” he wrote in the book. “Dissatisfaction arises precisely where democracy has triumphed most completely: it is a dissatisfaction <em>with</em> liberty and equality. Thus those who remain dissatisfied will always have the potential to restart history.”</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of this “dissatisfaction” was visible soon after the Cold War’s end.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1990s, the far right began making its presence felt in a handful of European elections: Austria’s Freedom Party even entered a governing coalition in 2000 after a strong showing in the 1999 election. The 2000s and early 2010s saw varying signs of antidemocratic activity in consolidated democracies, from both the religious right (Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s consolidation of power in Turkey) and the socialist left (Hugo Chavez’s attack on democracy in Venezuela).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as the 2010s wore on, it became clear that something new was happening on the right across advanced democracies. The reactionary right had risen to power in the United States, Hungary, Israel, India, Brazil, and Poland. Extreme-right western European parties — some of which, like Germany’s AfD, had a tenuous relationship at best with democracy — enjoyed an unprecedented wave of electoral success, winning larger seat shares in Parliaments and joining governing coalitions in larger numbers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every one of these new authoritarian movements presented itself as deeply and authentically democratic. While the parties openly attacked democracy-adjacent values — like liberalism, multiculturalism, or secularism — they all insisted that they supported the basic ideas of popular sovereignty and elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This strategy reflected the enduring global democratic consensus: A 2017 Pew survey of people in 38 countries found that huge majorities, a country median of 78 percent, believed that “a democratic system where representatives elected by citizens decide what becomes law” was a good way to run a country. Recognizing this reality, autocrats around the world began singing a more democratic tune.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In their 2022 book <em>Spin Dictators</em>, political scientists Sergei Guriev and Daniel Treisman quantitatively documented a transformation in global authoritarianism: a movement away from overt violent repression and toward manufacturing consent through ersatz elections and a managed press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Guriev and Treisman noted that this trend had even touched countries like Russia and Singapore, where public support for democracy as a governing system is far weaker than it is in the United States or western Europe. This, they argued, has a lot to do with democracy’s post-20th-century ideological dominance: On an interconnected planet where large portions of the world’s governments and citizens take democratic ideals seriously, even the most hardened authoritarian can face tangible consequences for open crackdowns on rights and freedoms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result was that political movements everywhere, but especially ones in seemingly consolidated democracies, had powerful incentives to develop a democratic-sounding justification for their actions — to Americanize their politics. By identifying domestic “enemies” that stood in for unwanted social change, they learned to galvanize a chunk of the public against those enemies in the name of protecting the homogeneous majority — an ironically universal playbook for antidemocratic success.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">While studying the rhetoric of these new authoritarian movements helps explain how they appealed to a mass audience, it doesn’t explain why people were especially attracted to their political vision today.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The theory of the reactionary spirit helps us understand this phenomenon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As democracy’s reach expanded across the globe, so, too, did political contests over inequality. That competition, one way or another, brought tensions over status and identity to the fore of the political conversation — ideal circumstances for the reactionary spirit to threaten democracies old and new.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the underlying structural reality that helped the authoritarian right break through in country after country. Under such conditions, all it would take to start a reactionary fire was some kind of spark: an external shock, a high-visibility left-wing push for social change, canny leadership on the reactionary side, or some combination of all three (as in the United States in the post-Obama era). The 2010s saw a series of such trigger events around the world: decades of democratic expansion and evolving reactionary responses leading to a simultaneous surge in support for reactionary factions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Europe, the 2015 refugee crisis played a central role in the story. That year, violent bloodshed in countries like Syria and Afghanistan produced the single greatest number of refugees since World War II, many of whom fled to Europe seeking a better life. The centrist European establishment, led by German chancellor Angela Merkel, chose to welcome them, creating an opportunity for far-right parties to increase their support among Europeans uncomfortable with a massive influx of people who looked different, prayed differently, and spoke different languages.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The effect was swift and striking: Data from The PopuList, which catalogs far-right electoral support in European elections since 1989, shows a spike in these factions’ support around the continent in the wake of the crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Broadly speaking, the evidence suggests that European resentment toward immigration is rooted in concerns about changes to Europe’s traditional ethnic composition and hierarchy. A 2007 study that examined 20 European countries and over 38,000 individuals found that negative attitudes about multiculturalism were by far the best predictor of individual opposition to immigration. Many other factors, like a country’s unemployment level or a person’s individual income, had a negligible effect.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This underlying hostility toward cultural difference created fertile grounds for far-right parties to profit from a sudden spike in immigrant numbers, especially since many immigrants came from nonwhite Muslim countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A 2018 paper by two German political scientists, Matthias Mader and Harald Schoen, examined a survey that asked the same group of people their opinions on elections and immigration before and after the refugee crisis. They found that attitudes on immigration, on the whole, hadn’t changed much: The same people who disliked immigration before the crisis still did afterward. But their partisan allegiances had shifted dramatically; anti-immigrant voters who had supported Merkel’s CDU defected to the AfD in significant numbers.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the reactionary spirit in action. The refugee crisis heightened the stakes for culturally conservative voters, forcing them to choose between centrist parties that were more welcoming to migrants and potentially antidemocratic extremists who opposed it. Many of them chose the latter, prioritizing preserving the traditional white-dominant society over protecting their democracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across Europe, far-right parties started to reap electoral dividends. In Hungary in particular, the surge in power of anti-immigrant politics allowed a government that had already moved in an authoritarian direction to push a new and potent propaganda line, harnessing the reactionary spirit to consolidate its hold on power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similar events took place outside Europe. Post-Cold War Israel went through multidecade struggles over its ethnoreligious identity and occupation of Palestinian land, ultimately creating conditions for the reactionary spirit to spread from a small handful of extremists to a significant portion of the population. In India, the reactionary right’s rise began with a staged crisis designed to bring out the Hindu majority’s unease with India’s vision of equality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fukuyama’s warning has proved prescient. Frustration with the dominant era of equality and liberal rights has kept history going, with the reactionary spirit threatening democracy even in its strongholds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Horrific crimes. Murders. Gang attacks against our police. Child sex crimes. And the brutal killing of a nursing student on her college campus.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the kind of rhetoric Republican convention-goers were exposed to in Milwaukee on Tuesday, after an ominous video — narrated with a deep voice that sounded like it came out of a 2000s action movie trailer — depicted a dystopian version of Joe Biden’s America.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The theme of the Republican National Convention’s second night was “Make America Safe Again,” and the roster of speakers repeatedly criticized Biden’s record on crime and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/361155/rnc-2024-republican-immigration-border-biden-policy-invasion-legal-gop">immigration</a>: Randy Sutton, a retired police officer, said there was a “war on cops.” Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said that Biden treats “police like criminals, and criminals like victims.”  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz declared that “your family is less safe, your children are less safe, the country is less safe,” as a result of Biden’s presidency. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the Republican speakers’ rhetoric on crime spiraling out of control was out of touch with reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While there was indeed a rise in crime during the pandemic, recent data has shown that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">crime is declining nationwide</a>. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/new-fbi-stats-show-historic-declines-violent-crime-rate-murder-showing-rcna156573#">According to the FBI</a>, murder is down 26 percent and robberies have declined by 18 percent in the first three months of 2024 compared to the same time last year. That didn’t stop Republican speakers throughout the night from singling out incidents of heinous crimes and drug overdoses to conjure up an image of lawlessness and disorder. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So why are Republicans plowing ahead with their “Make America Safe Again” messaging despite data that shows America is already getting safer? The answer is simple: Most Americans believe that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">crime is getting worse</a>, so it’s not a particularly tough message to sell.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The convention made clear that Republicans are running yet another <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns">law-and-order campaign</a>, drumming up fear among voters by leaning on racist tropes and dog whistles. Their insistence that cities are crime-ridden, though, is not only a means to spark fear in voters; it’s also a window into how they will approach public safety legislation if Donald Trump wins in November. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the Republican approach to crime looks like</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the pandemic, the conservative backlash to progressive criminal justice reforms, including lowering penalties, has grown. While some Democrats <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">have joined Republicans</a> in passing tough-on-crime legislation in the past year, Republicans have been harsher and more extreme in their response to the 2020 crime spike.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Louisiana, for example, passed a <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2024/03/09/louisiana-georgia-kentucky-tough-on-crime">slew of punitive measures</a> that included harsher penalties for various offenses and reduced parole eligibility, and even allowed for 17-year-olds to be tried as adults instead of in the juvenile justice system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republican politicians have also been outspoken critics of progressive district attorneys who have taken a softer approach to enforcing petty crimes. <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">Project 2025</a>, the Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for a second Trump administration, calls on the Department of Justice to <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/project-2025-compels-local-prosecutors-to-enforce-extreme-right-wing-laws/">compel local DAs to enforce</a> the laws that the federal government sees fit — including extreme right-wing policies — rather than leave that up to local prosecutors, as has long been customary. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Trump win would embolden Republicans to continue undoing the criminal justice reform that, in recent decades, reduced the prison population and lowered penalties for petty crimes. The result could be a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24139552/crime-rates-falling-tough-laws-mass-incarceration">renewed and further entrenched</a> era of mass incarceration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The GOP’s focus on crime might not work</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Surveys have shown that Americans always tend to think crime rates are getting worse, even when the opposite is true, but there’s a limit to how successful law-and-order campaigns can be. Recently, the Republican messaging hasn’t necessarily paid electoral dividends.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to the Vera Institute of Justice, for example, the 2022 midterms showed that Republicans’ fear-mongering rhetoric on crime <a href="https://www.vera.org/annual-report-2022/voters-reject-fearmongering-around-crime-and-public-safety-in-2022-midterms">didn’t seem to resonate with voters</a>. Republicans spent millions of dollars on campaign ads focusing on crime and public safety, but according to exit surveys commissioned by Vera Action, the lobbying group aligned with the Vera Institute of Justice, while voters were concerned about crime, they didn’t necessarily believe in more punitive policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, there’s a reason Republicans are focusing their rhetoric on crime: Democrats have been on the defensive on the issue, despite the fact that the data is in their favor. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of continuing to champion progressive changes to the criminal justice system, many Democrats have reversed course and pushed for harsher enforcement, fearing voter sentiment around crime. That was the case in New York, for example, where the Democratic governor <a href="https://apnews.com/article/new-york-city-subway-national-guard-crime-f046ecaac79601f6113efa8a0c8f25c7">sent the National Guard</a> to patrol the subway, and in Oregon, where <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/oregon-governor-signs-a-bill-recriminalizing-drug-possession#:~:text=SALEM%2C%20Ore.,was%20hobbled%20by%20implementation%20issues.">lawmakers recriminalized drugs</a> after voters in 2020 decriminalized them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the second night of the Republican convention was any indication, it’s that, despite falling crime rates, the GOP’s old law-and-order campaign playbook isn’t likely to go away anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t groundbreaking that the speakers who took to the Republican National Convention stage Tuesday spent much of the night railing against President Joe Biden’s border and immigration policies. Biden was enabling a “border bloodbath,” crowd signs read, as&nbsp;congressional leaders accused Biden of enabling a border “invasion.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nor was it new to see them use provocative, inflammatory, or extremist rhetoric to talk about immigrants and the Democratic incumbents. “Every day Americans are dying,” Texas Sen. Ted Cruz thundered, “murdered, assaulted, and raped by illegal immigrants that the Democrats have released.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What was<em> </em>clear is how the Republican Party of 2024 has fine-tuned its anti-immigration message for the American electorate of 2024: focusing on drugs, human trafficking, crime, and public disorder, and distinguishing between “illegal” immigrants who threaten the fabric of America and the right kind of migrant.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kari Lake, the election-denying GOP Senate candidate from Arizona, summed it up early in the night: The goal of the GOP must be to “stop the Bidenvasion and build the wall.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This all happened the night after Republican organizers tried to preach national unity in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, and some speakers said they toned down their speeches.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the Republican Party&#8217;s position on immigration might be more unifying than it looks. The data shows that Americans are much more against all kinds of immigration and more likely to favor more stringent border controls and immigration policies than when Trump ran for office the first or second time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, the America of 2024 is more anti-immigrant than in the recent past, more skeptical of immigration, and more open to policies that would have seemed extreme if they had been enacted when Trump was in office. This is in part because there really was an influx of migrants and a spike in border-crossing after Biden took office and as the pandemic wound down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This anti-immigrant shift has been quick but sustained. Since 2020, the share of Americans wanting the level of all immigration to decrease has shot up, from 28 percent in the middle of 2020 to 55 percent as of June 2024, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx">Gallup polling data</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those analysts note that 2024 is the first time since 2005 that the majority of the American public has wanted less immigration and that this anti-immigration sentiment is at its highest point since 2001, when the country was going through another bout of anti-immigrant fervor after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those shifts are also happening across all sectors of the electorate. It’s not just white voters. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx">Nonwhite</a> voters and especially <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/18/latino-immigrants-election-policy-deportation-discrimination">Latino</a> voters are <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/16/trump-latino-voter-enthusiasm-gap">more likely</a> than in the past to want less immigration, and anti-immigrant sentiment is rising across all partisan groups, including among Democrats. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the Trump years, the overall mood of the country shifted to be more pro-immigrant as Democratic voters became much more positive about immigration. That trend has shifted, even over the past year. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The opinions don’t lack <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/647123/sharply-americans-curb-immigration.aspx">nuance</a>. Voters are much more positive on legal migration than illegal immigration. They are more supportive of building a wall along the southern border with Mexico than they were during the Trump years, but they are also still receptive to providing a pathway to citizenship for those immigrants brought illegally into the United States as children (though even support for these Dreamers has steadily dropped).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, though, when thinking about the border and immigration, many Americans now seem to view the issue less as one about humanitarianism and human rights, and more through the lens of law and order, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift">immigration researchers have observed</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this was reflected in the position many Republican rising stars, candidates, and elected officials took on Tuesday night. Senate candidates, including Bernie Moreno of Ohio, Lake of Arizona, and Eric Hovde of Wisconsin, as well as former candidates Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, all talked about the benefits of legal immigration and the American dream while playing up the threat of fentanyl trafficking and immigrant drains on the American economy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They warned of the threat that an “invasion” at the southern border posed to the American dream. Moreno, himself a Colombian immigrant, emphasized that he and his parents immigrated to the US “legally” — then attacked Biden and Democrats for “encourag[ing] millions of illegals to invade America.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other Republican leaders, like House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Speaker Mike Johnson, played up the threat of non-citizen voting changing the fabric of the nation, “harm[ing] citizens, drain[ing] resources, and disrupt[ing] elections,” as Johnson said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The night’s closing message rounded out this critique of the status quo: “You can’t have a nation without borders.” It&#8217;s a simple pitch to those Americans who view migration as a question of order and process: upset at images of migrant caravans and river crossings, even if they don’t necessarily dislike the idea of extending the American dream.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2019, while Trump was in office, this strategic speech might not have resonated with most Americans. But in 2024, it’s ringing true to a growing share of the electorate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates">shooting of former President Donald Trump</a> at a Pennsylvania rally has raised serious questions about the security failures that enabled the attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While there was significant Secret Service presence as well as local law enforcement on the scene, a gunman was able to get onto the roof of a building <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/secret-service-faces-serious-questions-about-security-footprint-and-rooftop-access-at-trump-event/index.html">about 150 meters away from Trump</a> and fire at both him and members of the crowd. That development has prompted concerns about missteps made by the Secret Service and gaps in the coverage provided for the former president at the event.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We are speaking of a failure,” Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/15/politics/video/alejandro-mayorkas-security-failure-trump-rally-digvid">remarks about the attack.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scrutiny of what went wrong has spurred President Joe Biden to order an independent review of the issue. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/14/trump-rally-shooting-fbi-names-20-year-old-from-bethel-park-as-subject-involved">House Speaker Mike Johnson has called for one in the lower chamber</a> as well. “The Secret Service is working with all involved Federal, state and local agencies to understand what happened, how it happened, and how we can prevent an incident like this from ever taking place again,” <a href="https://www.secretservice.gov/newsroom/releases/2024/07/statement-us-secret-service-director-kimberly-cheatle">Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle said in a statement</a> regarding the shooting, noting that the agency would be fully cooperative with these investigations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s still a lot we don’t know as these reviews get underway, but early reports reveal potential lapses in coordination among federal and regional law enforcement, and a limited security perimeter that could have played a role.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why there’s scrutiny over security</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For events like this, the Secret Service typically <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/us/politics/secret-service-trump.html">designates a security perimeter</a>. It’s then responsible for protecting and screening the buildings and people within those confines.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The shooter scaled a building just outside that perimeter, about 148 meters away from Trump’s podium. Due to its location, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/trump-biden-election-2024-rnc/card/secret-service-didn-t-sweep-building-where-gunman-shot-trump-Kif4Lsd71nvhnceRf9zz">Secret Service did not sweep it</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/secret-service-faces-serious-questions-about-security-footprint-and-rooftop-access-at-trump-event/index.html">CNN reported</a>. Instead, local law enforcement was responsible for that area, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/secret-service-trump-rally-blame/index.html">the Secret Service has said.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That type of collaboration is standard and something the Secret Service often uses across different events due to the scope of resources required. “It is a fairly routine matter for all of our agencies to work jointly with the Secret Service,” Pennsylvania State Police Lt. Colonel George Bivens <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/secret-service-trump-rally-blame/index.html">said at a press briefing</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Local law enforcement has noted, however, that the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/16/politics/secret-service-trump-rally-blame/index.html">Secret Service was “the lead” on security.</a> That’s left the two groups effectively trading blame about who was ultimately responsible and suggesting that there may have been gaps in communication.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, the building the gunman shot from, which belonged to a glass research company, had been identified as a possible threat by the Secret Service prior to the Trump rally, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-rally-shooting-secret-service-identified-rooftop-security-flaw-rcna161783">NBC News reports</a>. Given the building’s proximity to Trump, and these revelations, questions have emerged about why the Secret Service didn’t direct local <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-rally-shooting-secret-service-identified-rooftop-security-flaw-rcna161783">police to station officers on the roof</a>, due to how close the building was. The Secret Service <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd167v5lpq2o">has said there was a local law enforcement team</a> located inside the building, something experts have described as less effective for deterring a gunman than officers on the exterior.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A few people at the rally also told the press that they saw the shooter as he climbed the rooftop; they tried to tell the police. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2024/07/15/trump-rally-shooting-witness-warning/">A Washington Post analysis</a> found that officers were warned by members of the audience about a minute and a half before the shooting began. Why those warnings went unheeded will be a key question for investigators to understand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also notable: The shooter had been seen pacing on the outskirts of the event, and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/-police-warned-secret-service-suspicious-person-trump-rally-shooting-rcna161933">local officers had flagged him as a suspicious individual</a> to keep an eye on prior to the attack. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/local-officer-tried-stop-gunman-trump/index.html">The Butler County Sheriff’s Office told CNN</a> that an officer approached the gunman on the roof, at which point the shooter pointed his weapon at the officer, forcing him to “take cover.” Law enforcement officers’ failure to apprehend the shooter before he fired multiple shots, hitting Trump in the ear, killing a member of the crowd and injuring two others, remains a major question.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The errors around the Trump shooting put a new spotlight on recent missteps by the Secret Service, which include an intruder inside <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/05/16/national-security-adviser-home-intrusion/">White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s home in 2023</a>, and another intruder <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/books/review/carol-leonnig-zero-fail.html">entering the White House</a> in 2014. They heighten the focus on past concerns agents have expressed about being <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/08/secret-service-overwork-morale-underfunded-report/">overworked and burnt out</a>, and they echo prior worries about how the Secret Service has been underfunded, something Congress sought to address with a big boost in appropriations this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd1jz027nrzo">The Secret Service has also rejected conspiracy theories</a> that some conservatives have floated about how the Trump campaign’s prior requests for more security have been denied, noting that his detail was bolstered earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s an untrue assertion that a member of the former President’s team requested additional security resources and that those were rebuffed,” Secret Service spokesman <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/14/politics/secret-service-faces-serious-questions-about-security-footprint-and-rooftop-access-at-trump-event/index.html">Anthony Guglielmi told CNN</a>. “This is absolutely false. In fact, we added protective resources &amp; technology &amp; capabilities as part of the increased campaign travel tempo.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A group of House Democrats who had supported a bill to strip Trump’s Secret Service detail if he was sentenced to prison <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-assassination-attempt-bennie-thompson-secret-service-security-1924954">has faced criticism</a> as well. That measure, which has not passed the House, would have applied if <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-would-lose-perks-under-democratic-bills_n_66621c5fe4b0f9f6da8081a7">he received a sentence of at least one year in prison</a>, which has not happened and may not happen.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The assassination attempt also underscores the country’s massive gun <a href="https://www.vox.com/23142734/kansas-city-superbowl-mass-shooting">problem</a> and the limitations of armed security as the central mode of combating it. The US’s gun homicide rate far outpaces that of its counterparts, and is 26 times higher than other high-income countries, per <a href="https://www.everytown.org/debunking-gun-myths-at-the-dinner-table/">gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety</a>. Researchers have found that armed law enforcement has failed to prevent or stymie other shootings in part because police aren’t able to respond in time or only able to react once it’s already happening. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/06/22/us/shootings-police-response-uvalde-buffalo.html">Per a 2022 Texas State University study</a>, police subdued the shooter in less than a third of active attacks between 2000 and 2021.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fight over whether President Joe Biden should remain Democrats’ presidential nominee has moved to a new phase, centering on whether the party should accelerate his official nomination through a virtual roll call as early as next week — or wait to do the honors in person at their August convention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden supporters want to move forward quickly with the virtual roll call, saying the plan has been set and approved for weeks — long before the presidential debate in June — and is necessary because of Republican moves in Ohio that once threatened to keep the president off the state’s ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Ohio lawmakers moved to close that loophole in late May. With Biden’s spot on the ballot now secured, Biden’s critics say, a virtual roll call process now amounts to an attempt to ram through his nomination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Who’s right? That depends on how safe you think Biden&#8217;s Ohio ballot spot is — and whether you think the party needs more time to decide on who should challenge Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ever since the jaw-dropping <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/357642/biden-trump-debate-presidential-cnn-poll-takeaways-live-coverage">presidential debate on June 27</a>, Democrats have had a heated internal fight over whether Biden should stay on the top of the ticket, given his alarming performance and seeming deteriorating health. Dozens of lawmakers and activists have called on the president to consider stepping aside ahead of the Democratic National Convention scheduled for August 19 in Chicago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden thus far has hotly rejected any suggestion he back out, but has also been unable to quiet questions and concerns from fellow Democrats and the press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The push to hold a virtual roll call ahead of the convention began in late May, when Ohio Senate Republicans tried to squeeze last-minute unrelated amendments to a bill ensuring Biden would appear on Ohio’s November ballot. Since then, though, Ohio lawmakers passed a “clean” bill to protect Biden’s ballot spot, rendering the need for a virtual roll call less necessary.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In light of the debate around Biden’s candidacy, some lawmakers and DNC delegates have urged the party to abandon its virtual roll call plan and wait until next month to select the presidential nominee in person.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">California Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman circulated a letter on Monday among his House Democratic colleagues calling on the party to hold off on a virtual roll call process and wait until the convention. “To try to squelch debate and jam this through is a power play of the highest order,” Huffman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/16/us/politics/dnc-biden-nominee.html">told the New York Times</a>. The newly formed Pass the Torch group also released a statement on Monday blasting the virtual roll call as an “unjustified push” to ram through a Biden nomination.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Democratic Party is having a conversation on the most important topic imaginable – what is the best path forward to defeat Donald Trump and win control of Congress. Stifling this debate and prematurely shutting down any possible change in the Democratic ticket through an unnecessary and unprecedented ‘virtual roll call’ in the days ahead is a terrible idea,” said Pass the Torch activist Aaron Regunberg.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question at hand, now, is whether Democrats should trust that Ohio Republicans are truly done playing games, and whether the November ballot issue is really resolved. The new Ohio law takes effect August 31.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden campaign, DNC chair Jaime Harrison, and Ohio Democratic Party Chair Elizabeth Walters have all said Ohio Republicans should not be trusted, and they insist the stakes are too high to risk the GOP backtracking somehow later this summer. They say the fact that the law is not already in effect creates an opportunity for misbehavior.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Trusting the Ohio GOP to do the right thing for voters is like trusting an arsonist to put out a fire,” Walters said in a statement to Vox, pointing to <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdoh/pr/former-ohio-house-speaker-sentenced-20-years-prison-leading-racketeering-conspiracy">a $60 million corruption scandal</a> involving the state’s House Republican speaker from 2023, and heavily gerrymandered maps the Ohio Supreme Court has ruled unconstitutional <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/opinion/ohios-wobbly-and-ongoing-path-to-fair-maps/">seven times</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This election comes down to nothing less than saving our democracy from a man who has said he wants to be a dictator on ‘day one’ — so we certainly are not going to leave the fate of this election in the hands of MAGA Republicans in Ohio that have tried to keep President Biden off of the general election ballot,” Harrison of the DNC told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Republican leaders in Ohio, meanwhile, say the ballot nominating issue is now moot and blasted Democrats for trying to gin up more panic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The issue is resolved in Ohio, and Democratic activists should stop trying to scapegoat Ohio for their party dysfunction,” said Ben Kindel, a spokesperson for Ohio’s Secretary of State Frank LaRose. Kindel shared with Vox a legal advisory LaRose sent to all Ohio County Board of Elections directors and board members on June 3 affirming that the deadline for political parties to certify their presidential and vice-presidential candidates is now September 1 — well after Democrats’ convention in Chicago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A spokesperson for Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine also told Vox that the new Ohio law would ensure that any nominee selected at the DNC’s August convention would appear on the November ballot. “The new law is structured so that it will take effect in time for it to serve as legal instructions for the Ohio secretary of state to prepare the ballot,” the spokesperson, Dan Tierney, said. “Every single Democrat member of the General Assembly voted in favor of <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/files/special-session/hb2_04_EN.pdf">[the bill]</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden campaign allies reject the idea that the DNC is doing anything other than sticking to the plan party leaders decided on more than a month ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the party has failed to explain how Ohio Republicans could actually prevent a Democrat from appearing on the November ballot now that a law has been passed to ensure it. By pushing through a cautious early vote with no clear legal justification, Democrats risk fueling more distrust among voters they’ll need to win November. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/16/biden-dnc-vote-nomination-states-2024-election">Axios reported on Tuesday</a> that a Democratic official briefed on the party’s plans said DNC leaders “rarely mention” Ohio internally as the reason to push forward with an earlier nominating date.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s disingenuous for the Biden-aligned forces to be making arguments that seem to reference the Ohio law, but whose actual purpose is pretty clearly to allow for the president’s renomination as early and with as little drama as possible,” said Daniel Schlozman, a Johns Hopkins University political scientist who<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691248554/the-hollow-parties"> recently co-authored a book</a> on weakened political parties.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That’s what, in other contexts, we would call misinformation,” he said. “Ever since 1968, reformers have argued that party processes should be open. For much longer than that, the convention has been the apex of party authority, with the national committee just the continuing body between conventions. The virtual roll call violates both of those core principles without a compelling justification.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How the virtual roll call came to be</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ohio election law requires political parties to confirm their presidential candidates 90 days before the November election, but that date this year — August 7 — falls well before the DNC’s scheduled convention. This isn’t the first time Ohio lawmakers have had to pass special legislation to get around this problem; they did so also in 2020 for Donald Trump and 2012 for Barack Obama.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alabama also has a similar 90-day-rule rule, and this past May Alabama lawmakers <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-ballot-access-alabama-ohio-2c802f24e4b88a359c84b180f0e363ec">unanimously approved a bill</a> to ensure Biden would appear on the ballot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">LaRose flagged the nominating deadline issue in early April. And by mid-April Ohio Republicans, who control the state legislature, agreed to pass a bill ensuring Biden would appear on the ballot. On May 7, an Ohio House committee passed <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/05/28/dems-say-they-will-get-around-biden-ohio-ballot-issue-by-holding-virtual-roll-call-before-deadline/#:~:text=stripped%20and%20amended-,Senate%20Bill%2092,-making%20it%20a">a bipartisan bill out of committee</a> to fix the problem, extending the nomination deadline to August 23. Republican House Speaker Jason Stephens praised it at the time, noting it helps both parties.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Just four years ago, we had this issue,” Stephens <a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2024/05/08/ohio-lawmakers-err-in-attempt-to-fix-biden-ballot-problem/">told Ohio Capital Journal on May 8</a>. “The party in power in the White House usually goes last for the convention, so hopefully this will take care of that issue.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problems came after, when some Senate Republican lawmakers tried to squeeze in <a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/sb215">controversial amendments to limit outside spending</a> to state and local ballot measures — a move many experts believe was in response to Ohio’s winning abortion rights ballot measure <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/8/23952090/ohio-election-results-issue-1-abortion-virginia-kentucky-roe-dobbs">last year</a>. (Ohioans United for Reproductive Rights <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/politics/ohio-politics/supporters-of-ohio-abortion-rights-amendment-far-outraising-opponents">raised three times</a> as much as anti-abortion opponents.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The proposed Senate amendments — which Democrats blasted as unrelated “poison pills” — would have prevented political spending from outside the US, required more campaign finance disclosures, and made it harder overall for groups to collect petition signatures. Even though Ohio voters <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/8/8/23817989/issue-1-ohio-special-election-2023-results-abortion-rights">overwhelmingly rejected another Republican proposal last August</a> that would have made it harder to place measures on the ballot, many GOP elected officials claimed outside spending was to blame for that result.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By May 23, the nominating deadline issue was still not resolved, and DeWine publicly urged the legislature to reach a compromise. “Ohio is running out of time to get Joe Biden, sitting president of the United States, on the ballot this fall,” DeWine <a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/politics/ohio-politics/what-to-know-ahead-of-ohios-special-session-to-fix-biden-ballot-debacle">said during a press conference</a>. “Failing to do so is simply not acceptable. This is ridiculous; this is an absurd situation.” DeWine also then endorsed the idea to ban foreign spending from state ballot measure campaigns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On May 28, amid all this chaos, the Democratic National Committee <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/28/biden-democratic-nomination-ohio/">made its decision</a> to hold a virtual roll call vote by August 7, so they could resolve Ohio’s nominating deadline problem without relying on Ohio Republicans to address it. By June 4, the DNC’s Rules and Bylaws Committee voted to move forward, and the full DNC membership finalized approval for the virtual roll call process on June 20.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The DNC has two more scheduled meetings to finalize this process —&nbsp;this coming Friday and this coming Sunday. Both meetings will be streamed on YouTube, and the virtual roll call could take place soon after that, as early as Sunday. The last possible date it could be held is August 7.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We look forward to nominating Joe Biden through a virtual roll call and celebrating with fanfare together in Chicago in August alongside the 99 percent of delegates who are supporting the Biden-Harris ticket,” DNC Chair Harrison told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to party rules, the Democratic Party <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-team-suggests-can-no-alternative-dnc-rules-provide-path-rcna160092?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma&amp;taid=66856e93e82a0b0001bcaa1e&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">could still replace Biden with someone else</a> should he choose to voluntarily step aside after the August convention, but it would be a contentious process so close to Election Day. The new nominee would be selected by the 435 members of the Democratic National Committee, rather than the nearly 4,000 pledged convention delegates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Information is still emerging about the shooting at former President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday. However, even though the complete picture isn’t available, there are ways to think about the political and social moment we’re living in and how it may have contributed to the violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We do know <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-shooting-raises-questions-about-security-lapses-2024-07-14/">the shooter</a>, Thomas Matthew Crooks, was a 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, about a 75-minute drive from Butler, where the rally was being held. He was a registered Republican (though he also made a $15 donation to a progressive group), perpetrated the shooting with an AR-15 style rifle purchased by his father, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/07/14/us/trump-shooting-election/heres-the-latest?smid=url-share">had at least two explosive devices</a> with him. And he was killed by a Secret Service agent after he killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore and injured Trump as well as two others. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s entirely possible the shooting won’t be deemed “political” at all — we simply don’t know enough about the motive. But it’s fair to say that the attempted assassination has raised the political temperature in an already volatile country. Since Trump’s 2016 election, the US has seen the <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/8/14/16143168/charlottesville-va-protests">Charlottesville protests</a>, the 2018 <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/29/18037580/pittsburgh-shooter-anti-semitism-racist-jewish-caravan">Tree of Life shooting</a>, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/5/16/23074812/buffalo-shooting-accelerationism-great-replacement-neo-nazi">2022 Buffalo shooting</a>, and the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot, among other events; now, the specter of political violence looms over our future, too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To better understand the anxious and destabilized moment we’re living in, Vox spoke to four experts to help explain how political polarization, state violence, online radicalization, and feelings of disenfranchisement can drive political violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Based on our conversations, here are five ways we should think about political violence in this historic moment — why it breaks out and why violent periods often get worse before they get better. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Extreme polarization can make political violence more likely</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Violence of this nature is unpredictable; that’s part of what makes it terrifying. Mass shootings, terror attacks, and political violence like Saturday’s shooting are profoundly destabilizing, especially in a profoundly violent time, with multiple wars and civil conflicts ongoing. But we do know that there are social, political, and interpersonal factors that contribute to public, politically motivated violence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Lilliana Mason, associate professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University:</strong> Political violence is more likely to emerge when a society is politically divided along identity-based lines. When parties are on opposite sides of racial, ethnic, or religious divides (like our parties are in the US), it becomes easier for people to think of their political opponents as enemies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the US, we’re also geographically divided, so partisans have little exposure to regular people from the other party. This creates what we call “moral disengagement,” which consists of vilifying and dehumanizing attitudes toward our political opponents. These attitudes allow us to harm our fellow citizens without feeling like bad people ourselves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Erik Nisbet, professor of</strong> <strong>policy analysis and communication at Northwestern University:</strong> We’re incredibly tribal and our political identities have become almost mega identities. They supersede all other social or cultural identities that we have. For some people, this is combined with these perceptions and rhetoric of dehumanizing the other side: “The other side is immoral — and an existential threat to our group, to our identity …”<br><br>And if the other side is immoral, not human and a threat, then violence becomes almost morally justified. “I still can be a good person and engage in violence.” And that’s how many of those around January 6, for example, viewed themselves: They were good people. They were righting a wrong. And violence was justified in that case.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Political violence is more American than we’d like to admit</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Violence has always been a part of our politics. As <em>Today, Explained</em> host <a href="https://megaphone.link/VMP3197633622">Sean Rameswaram put it recently</a>, “Joe Biden has spoken about three times in about 24 hours about this assassination attempt on his opponent … The first time he said, ‘This isn’t us.’ The second time he said, ‘This isn’t us.’ The third time he said, ‘This isn’t us.’ But I think students of history might recall that this is kind of ‘us.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nisbet</strong>: Unfortunately, it’s us, but there is something different in this historical moment. What’s different over the last 10 years is that political violence is no longer just political violence — it’s partisan violence. It’s violence that’s focused on and centered around our political identities as Democrat and Republican. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Previously, political violence was actually pretty symmetrical on the left and the right; it was focused around more general ideologies. Focused on maybe single issues. Now, political violence, the trends in recent years, are focused on more, “I am a Democrat, and thus I support violence against Republicans” or vice versa. And at least in terms of the number of violent acts tracked by the FBI and domestic terrorism databases, it has been more right-leaning in recent years than left.</p>

</div></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Today’s extremism didn’t appear out of nowhere</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politically motivated public violence doesn’t happen in a vacuum; people don’t simply plan an assassination attempt or bombing for no reason. Political radicalization, personal grievance, and psychological illness all interact with social forces like political polarization — as well as the bare fact of <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/360742/someone-tried-to-assassinate-the-former-president-and-the-gop-still-wont-talk-about-guns" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/360742/someone-tried-to-assassinate-the-former-president-and-the-gop-still-wont-talk-about-guns">widely available deadly weapons</a> — to make political violence more likely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Kurt Braddock, assistant </strong><strong>professor of public communications at American University</strong><strong>: </strong>We’re finding that extremists are motivated often by the way that they engage with content online, whether that content be a social network, or content that they’re absorbing. It never occurs in a black box and never occurs in isolation. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s always some kind of way that the attacker perceives that their action is part of a greater movement they learned about and are motivated by, in the context of their interactions, usually with people online. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is some social upheaval when assassination attempts occur. It often has to do with the shooters’ perceptions of that social upheaval. Oftentimes, they feel as though they’ve been personally victimized, or that they perceive that there has been a threat by the target on them, or their own safety, which is why I think there’s a connection between state repression and actual violence against politicians. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Violence can come from a perception that people are losing their rights&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The loss of privileges and rights —&nbsp;whether real or perceived —&nbsp;is another motivator of political violence. That’s a fairly easy pattern to recognize throughout the 20th and 21st centuries in American history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Violence perpetrated by the state against citizens also plays a part in acts of violence against the state or its representatives. When the state visits its disproportionate capacity for violence on people — whether that is via repressive legislation or police brutality — violence against the state becomes a more logical response. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Braddock:</strong> There’s pretty significant literature that shows that one of the things that increases violence generally — not just terrorism, but also insurrection and riot and things like that — is state repression and the idea that people are losing their rights, that people have a perception that they’ve been victimized in a way. That’s been in the literature for quite some time. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a theory of radicalization that argues that when one “side” starts to become more and more radical, the other side feels the need to engage in defense — they get radicalized themselves to engage in defense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nathan Kalmoe, executive director of the Center for Communication and Civil Renewal at the University of Wisconsin-Madison:</strong> Many political scientists define the state as an entity that holds a monopoly on the legitimate use of force within its territory. In other words, the state can do violence, and no other person or group can do so toward the state or each other without punishment. That puts the threat of state violence against its citizens at the center of our understanding of government, even for good governments. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">State violence and political violence by citizens are often mutually supportive. For example, the violent white supremacist response to the Civil Rights Movement often combined Klan violence alongside police violence against activists and ordinary citizens. Sometimes they coordinated or even worked together, while other times they merely worked toward the same broad goals of maintaining white supremacy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Research by <a href="https://christiandavenportphd.weebly.com/">Professor Christian Davenport</a> at the University of Michigan and his colleagues shows that people tend to view the appropriateness of violence by the state and violence by citizens as proportional to each other in ways that parallel proportionate/disproportionate violence in wars. So, police acting with disproportionate violence against protesters makes people more willing to endorse proportionate violence against police in response.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Violence begets violence</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US body politic is already highly polarized, and an apparent attempt on a presidential candidate’s life is not going to change that. In fact, there is some reason to be concerned about the possibility that more violence of this nature is in store in the coming months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Nisbet: </strong>One of the drivers of political violence is what we call meta perceptions. If a Democrat thinks Republicans are violent, they’re more likely to engage in violence themselves and vice versa. It’s “If they pull a knife, we pull a gun.” And so acts of political violence actually will beget violence because it makes each group more willing to engage in violence as sort of a self-protective function. And that becomes like a self-reinforcing spiral.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Kalmoe:</strong> I’m very worried about the potential for subsequent political violence. What we learn about motives may have a big impact on that. The vast majority of Americans are opposed to political violence, but that shifts substantially if the other side is seen as acting violently first. The most inflammatory situation would be an ideologically motivated killer from the political left, though it helps that Democratic leaders have uniformly denounced the violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Braddock:</strong> I’m glad to see that people on both sides, whether politically motivated or not, are coming out against political violence. And I’m hoping that that’s a trend that continues. I wouldn’t say I’m confident, but I am hoping for it. I worry, though, that we are going to see more violence coming from this.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The original <em>Twister</em> (1996), a beloved cinematic touchstone, is a story about so many things: the wonder of nature, the dissolution of a romance, the aerodynamics of cows, the thrill of data collection, a trial balloon for the idea of Helen Hunt-as-sex-symbol, the perfection of Philip Seymour Hoffman as a dude’s rock dude, and the eternal question of whether or not weather can be vindictive. At the same time, it’s very much about one specific thing: the human obsession with tornadoes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their destructive power. Their unpredictability. Their elusiveness. What isn’t endlessly fascinating about a 300-mph, five-minute long wind storm capable of <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2019/7/30/20746792/tornado-alley-twister-us">cataclysmic destruction</a>? And because of that collective fascination with cyclones — and perhaps the human fascination with the nearly 30-year-old original movie and Hollywood’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22890147/scream-5-matrix-4-legacyquel">love of a franchise</a> — Universal is releasing a follow-up, <em>Twisters</em>, on July 19.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In honor of <em>Twister</em> and <em>Twisters</em>, I sought out an expert to further shed light on the human-tornado-<em>Twister</em> dynamic. Finding a tornado to interview was difficult, but I did speak to <a href="https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/geography-meteorology/about-us/facultyandstaff/calldavid">Dave Call</a>, a storm chaser since the ’90s and professor at Ball State University’s geography and meteorology program. Call is currently writing a memoir about his storm chasing experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Call explained to me, there are a lot of factors that have and haven’t changed storm chasing in the 28 years since<em> Twister</em>’s release, but the main thing to know is that while the chase to find them might be easier, the actual causes of tornadoes are still as <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22465340/tornado-science-how-do-they-form-mystery">unpredictable and mysterious</a> as they’ve ever been.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be clear, storm chasing is dangerous. The material in this story is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute professional advice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Dave. I must know. Have you seen </strong><strong><em>Twister</em></strong><strong>? Did it have any significant impact on you and storm chasing?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to say it came out after my first or second year in college. So of course we had to go see it. And meteorology majors, my friends and I, enjoyed poking fun at some of the weather shenanigans that took place in the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What were the “weather shenanigans” that you thought were funny?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is more like insider baseball, but for starters: these crazy tornadoes. Tornadoes themselves are actually pretty rare. It’s also unusual how all these people could amazingly survive all these deadly tornadoes. Like, [if you’re in the middle of a tornado] the building’s not gonna get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlzxlWzqtvk">blown <em>away</em> from you</a>. You’re gonna get flattened by the building or the cows and things like that.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2571_D038_00298RV2_CROP.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,8.5936325236149,100,82.81273495277" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A still from &lt;em&gt;Twisters&lt;/em&gt; which may feature some zany weather shenanigans divorced from how dangerous and scary tornadoes actually are." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You mentioned that you’ve been storm chasing unofficially since the ’90s — around when </strong><strong><em>Twister</em></strong><strong> first hit theaters — and officially at Ball State since 2008. Can you tell me about your experience?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I came to Ball State, they asked if I could teach the storm chasing class that my predecessor developed. And I thought, sure, why not? I love to travel. I like the weather. And now I&#8217;ve done it 19 times, and we’ve covered close to 130,000 miles.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Are you and your class looking for tornadoes specifically?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are looking for tornadoes, but tornadoes are random freaks of nature. Most tornadoes last less than five minutes. If you see a tornado, it’s obviously a big rush. It’s exciting and amazing. But I always have to tamp down expectations because if you go out there only to see tornadoes, you’re going to end up being very disappointed — we’re often at the mercy of the bigger weather pattern. In roughly about half of our trips, we’ve seen a tornado.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re also out there learning a lot more about how thunderstorms work, and students get a great chance to forecast and figure out what storms are going to do in a situation where stakes are relatively low. I’m also going to make sure we don’t, you know, get ourselves killed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>That’s a good goal! What’s the scariest experience you’ve had?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several times we have been caught in torrential rain and visibility goes to near zero.&nbsp;Imagine the heaviest rain you’ve experienced, then double the intensity. Driving is dangerous and we have lost awareness of where the tornado may be.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But you asked for a specific moment, so here’s a story: In June 2012, we were in the Oklahoma panhandle.&nbsp;A rotating storm was to our northwest, so we went to the west to get a better look.&nbsp;As we approached, it developed a wall cloud — a precursor to a tornado&nbsp;— but also turned to the southeast.&nbsp;Suddenly we were in danger. Because the storm had turned, heavy rain was now behind us, and we couldn’t go back the way we came. In front of us was a rotating wall cloud!&nbsp;Our only option was to skirt the wall cloud as we went west to the next paved road south, into Texas.&nbsp;Those were some very tense minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2012texas.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The storm professor Dave Call mentioned as being one of the scariest in his storm chasing career. | David Call/Ball State" data-portal-copyright="David Call/Ball State" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Do you have any safety tips?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before going on our storm chasing trip, students must score over 80 percent on a safety quiz!&nbsp;Here are my five most important tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Never chase at night.</li>



<li>Never chase near cities or forested areas.&nbsp;You can’t see anything, you can’t move quickly, and you could be hit by debris.</li>



<li>Never chase on interstates.</li>



<li>Never chase alone. Corollary: chase with someone with experience. It’s dangerous to look at the radar, read the map, and look at the storm while trying to drive!</li>



<li>Always have at least one escape route​.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s been the biggest change in storm chasing since you’ve been storm chasing?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Technology has really made it much easier for anybody to go out and chase storms. Nowadays, anybody can go out with radar on their phone and try to position themselves to see a tornado. You could spend 10 to 15 minutes poking around online and learn enough about how supercell storms are structured to figure out how to chase one yourself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I don’t know if chasing storms is really for me [Ed note: It isn’t.], but it sounds like it’s a matter of data and information.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you went out storm chasing in the ’80s or early ’90s, it was all basically visual storm chasing. If you really wanted to know what was going on, you’d have to pop into a weather service office somewhere, or have somebody in an office somewhere that you could call into and ask what the weather looks like.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, I want to say it was in the 1990s, you started to be able to get some satellite feeds of weather. These were expensive and you needed special equipment, but at least now you could get radar information in your vehicle. You still might have to go to the Weather Service, or go to a library to find the internet to get weather data.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first year I went out in 2008 [with Ball State], we had a satellite feed of weather information, and we actually stopped at the library several times to get weather information. Then the year after that, we went ahead and got a mobile hotspot and we could look at weather information on our laptop. But of course, the problem was that the cellphone network 15 years ago was sparse if you had the wrong carrier or you were in the wrong area. And keep in mind, a lot of times these storms are in pretty rural areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in the last 15 years, the cellphone networks have greatly improved and you have all this stuff on your phone. The original software we were using back in the late ’90s, early 2000s — the startup cost to get into storm chasing could be pushing four figures. Well now, if you have a phone and you buy an app, you’re talking maybe $10. So it’s so much easier to get that radar information.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Are there any other game changers?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Navigation. In 2008, we were using paper maps. I mean, there’s that line in the <em>Twister</em> movie&nbsp;about rolling the maps. GPS has gotten better and you can immediately see where you are.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It sounds like tech is the great equalizer. Like anyone can do storm chasing and it’s super popular — maybe more popular than the time after the original movie. But it also doesn’t seem like there’s a strict “storm chaser” label anymore.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One thing I talked about early on in my book is about storm chasing in general and how there’s a lot of people that are out there observing storms and doing different things.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I mean, there’s weather researchers, and there’ll be some professors or research scientists who may be professors or government — it all gets a little confusing — but they’re out there. But then there’s also people like me that are teaching classes. There are journalists that are covering it as part of their job. There are weather spotters, and then just people doing it because they find it cool, like the people who hike to the tops of mountains or try to get to every country in the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I want to talk about those weather researchers. The original movie centered on storm chasers and the lack of data they had about tornadoes. Is that still the case some 30 years later? Are tornadoes still a big mystery to us? What questions do we still have about them?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m trying to give you an answer without going too far beyond what I know.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ll say this: We know a lot more about tornadoes and how they work. We know a lot more about how tornadoes form. But one of the challenges we still have is figuring out which thunderstorms will produce a tornado and which ones won’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By comparison, hurricanes don’t take us by surprise. We have giant satellites. And as we’ve seen with [Hurricane] Beryl, they may rapidly intensify or weaken but they occur over a relatively long period of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tornadoes are so brief. We’re getting better at answering that question, but the challenge is that we’re getting to the edge of what we can easily measure. Being able to get the data we need to unlock them is hard because it’s a very tiny scale.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It sounds like trying to hit a moving target, while you yourself are moving too. It also sounds like a problem from the original movie: Tornadoes are still very unpredictable and getting immense amounts of data of this random, fleeting thing is very difficult.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, it’s the age-old mystery and question surrounding meteorology. So much of it all is in those subtle details. Which is ironic because in a sense, that’s the most important thing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the Greensburg tornado, <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ddc/greensburgfiveyear">which leveled the Kansas town in 2007</a>, was three miles south, it would have just been another tornado. It would have been an intense one, but not [one that caused so much destruction].&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Is that the reason why humans are still so crucial in meteorology and storm chasing?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A good example would be flying. Autopilot is great, but what about when it really matters: take-off, landing, or bad weather?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I hate to admit it, but a computer can do as good a forecast as I can and, many days out of the year, your weather app is gonna get you a reasonably good forecast. But the days when it matters — the days with tornadoes, the days when there’s a potential blizzard about to hit New York City, the days when there’s a hurricane that’s going to come ashore — those are the days when you need meteorologists.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can see these things, these big ingredients coming together, and then downscaling all that to individual storms, and then individual tornadoes at specific times at specific locations. The devil is in the details.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In recent years, we’ve heard about the link between </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/352234/how-one-weather-extreme-can-make-the-next-one-even-more-dangerous"><strong>climate change and extreme weather</strong></a><strong>. Does climate change have an effect on storm chasing or tornadoes?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To get thunderstorms, you need a bunch of different factors to come together. Climate change modifies some factors in favorable manners and unfavorable manners. How climate change may affect the number of storms, the intensity and the severity of storms, and the location of storms — those are all things we’re still trying to figure out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was just something that came out, I want to say it was in the last couple of months, a paper that suggested that <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/10/weather-tornado-alley-east">tornadoes are shifting eastward in the country</a>, out of the Plains and more into sort of the Mississippi Valley. That would actually make storm chasing a little harder.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is where the research gets sort of messy because you’ve got a bunch of things all changing at once. But the fact is that if storms move out of the Great Plains, that would be bad for storm chasing because it’s much easier to chase when you have open landscapes with relatively few trees, few hills, and few people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anecdotally, there’s some talk among storm chasers that the seasons these days aren’t as good as they used to be, and I’m not going to speculate on whether that’s true or not. But yes, climate change may affect where storms occur and when they occur, and make it harder to chase storms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The good analogy with climate change is that it’s sort of stacking the deck. I do an example with my students in class where I take a deck of cards, and I pull out a few of the black cards. Now guess what? When you start turning over cards, you get a lot more red cards.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>So climate change isn’t necessarily directly related to the result. It’s not making you pull diamonds or hearts. But it’s changing the circumstances which can make pulling diamonds and hearts happen more frequently.&nbsp;That makes sense to me, a person who is not well-versed in meteorology.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More generally speaking, one of the great difficulties with climate change and figuring out how it affects weather is that weather itself is highly variable. If anything, the number of tornadoes in this country hasn’t really increased. In fact, the number <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-experiencing-tornado-outbreaks-despite-fewer-tornado-days/story?id=110110803">has been decreasing in recent years</a>. Is that because of climate change, or is that some broader cyclical pattern?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Teasing out climate change amidst all the noise makes it difficult to assess. But once we get more years and more data points, we can start to say these things more confidently.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>My last question: Are you going to see </strong><strong><em>Twisters, </em></strong><strong>Dave?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, I’m gonna go watch the movie. If nothing else, my students and everyone who knows me are going to ask my opinion of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Maybe journalists too!</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s my answer: I’ll do it for scientific purposes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many congressional Democrats believe their party is hurtling toward a cliff’s edge and shouldn’t even bother trying to turn around.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Late last week, Senate Democrats held a private meeting to discuss Joe Biden’s electoral viability in the wake of his disastrous debate performance and subsequent revelations of his apparent cognitive decline. According to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/13/democrats-biden-concerns-00167915">Politico</a>, no more than four of the caucus’s 50 Democrats said they were committed to sticking with Biden as their party’s nominee.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By many accounts, a large majority of Democrats on the Hill believe that Biden has little hope of defeating Donald Trump and that a different candidate would have a better chance. The Capitol Hill reporters Heather Caygle and Jake Sherman <a href="https://x.com/heatherscope/status/1810684842205729203">claim</a> that they haven’t spoken to a single congressional Democrat “who privately says they think Biden is capable of running and beating Trump at this point.” Unnamed “senior Democrats” have told <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2024/07/15/can-trump-pivot-and-can-biden-run-out-the-clock-00168222">Politico</a> they’re convinced the president will lose the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then a 20-year-old man <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360390/trump-shot-assassination-attempt-shooter-bullet-butler-pennsylvania-biden-secret-service-updates">nearly assassinated Trump</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The former president’s near-death experience has rendered some Democrats even more pessimistic about Biden’s chances. And yet, Saturday’s tragic events have also led many to give up on persuading him to step aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The precise rationale for this surrender varies between lawmakers. Democrats who spoke with the Washington Post’s <a href="https://x.com/FaceTheNation/status/1812518504811163888">Robert Costa</a> said, in his summary, “it’s time for the country to stick together, and that means Democrats sticking together as well.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Jonathan Chait <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/the-democratic-partys-strange-attraction-to-defeatism.html">notes</a>, this argument is incoherent. It is unclear why a shocking act of violence — committed by a young person with no discernible political motive — compels Democrats to change their behavior. If the concern is unifying the nation, it seems counterproductive to line up behind a president with a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">38 percent </a>approval rating.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regardless, the impulse to prioritize the pursuit of unity over victory is informed by fatalism: Many Democrats have decided that the attempt on Trump’s life has made him unbeatable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A senior House Democrat told <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/14/house-democrats-biden-trump-rally-shooting">Axios</a> Sunday, “We’ve all resigned ourselves to a second Trump presidency.” A veteran Democratic consultant echoed this new conventional wisdom in an interview with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-fret-political-fallout-trump-rally-shooting-rcna161789">NBC</a> News the same day, saying, “The presidential contest ended last night.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Democrats are certain to lose no matter whom they nominate, then why bother with the uncomfortable, divisive task of trying to persuade your party’s president to forfeit the nomination?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this defeatism is rooted more in Democrats’ own cowardice than objective reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We do not yet have much polling data taken after the assassination attempt against Trump, but there’s no reason to assume that the Republican’s brush with death will secure him a durable surge in support. America is a deeply divided country, and voters’ views of Trump are generally deep-seated at this point. The defining feature of this year’s polls has been <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360521/trump-shooting-polls-political-impact-2024-election-election">their relative insensitivity</a> to (even extraordinary) events.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s criminal conviction cost him only about <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/354234/trump-conviction-polls-voters">1 percentage point</a> in polls taken immediately afterward, and this shift dissipated in the ensuing weeks. Biden’s catastrophic debate performance shaved only about <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360521/trump-shooting-polls-political-impact-2024-election-election">2 points</a> off his margin. Maybe Saturday’s assassination attempt will prove to be the one thing capable of totally upending the race, but there’s no reason to presume it will.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if there is a large shift in polls this week, such a change is likely to revert toward the long-running average over time. Four months is an eon in the American news cycle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the polling data taken through the end of last week suggests that the Democratic Party is in okay political shape. It’s only Joe Biden who is not.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked which party they would like to see running Congress, voters currently <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/">favor</a> the Democrats over the Republicans by 0.6 points, according to FiveThirtyEight’s polling average. In battleground states, Democratic Senate candidates are consistently outperforming Biden. A <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/07/15/us/elections/times-siena-poll-pennsylvania-toplines.html">New York Times/Siena College poll</a> released Monday found the president trailing Trump by 3 points in Pennsylvania, while Democratic Sen. Bob Casey leads his Republican challenger David McCormick by 11 points.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, a fresh set of <a href="https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/documents/Times_SAY24_20240712_state_poll_results.pdf">swing-state surveys</a> from YouGov found Trump leading Biden by 7 points in Arizona, 2 points in Michigan, 4 points in Nevada, 5 points in Wisconsin, and 3 points in Pennsylvania. In those very same polls, Democratic Senate candidates led Republican ones in all of those states by 7 points or more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some Democrats believe that only Kamala Harris could realistically replace Biden and that she would make no stronger a candidate than the president, even in his diminished state.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think this view is mistaken. For one thing, we’re in uncharted territory; no one can be fully certain of what would happen if Biden stepped aside. More importantly, though, there is good reason to think that Democrats could improve their prospects by replacing Biden with Harris. The vice president is currently polling at least as well against Trump as Biden is: In RealClearPolitics’s <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris">polling average,</a> Harris trails Trump by 2 points while Biden <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden">trails</a> him by 2.7 points.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris also has a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">lower</a> disapproval rating <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">than Biden</a>. It’s conceivable that her numbers are currently depressed by her association with him.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most critically, Harris is not in conspicuous cognitive decline. An overwhelming majority of voters do not <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359362/biden-dropout-2024-undemocratic-primaries-voters">consider her too old to serve</a>. She is a competent public speaker. All of these qualities differentiate her from Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s boosters may cite his relatively small polling decline since the debate as evidence that he’s still viable. After all, as I wrote above, the significance of even extraordinary campaign events tends to dissipate over time. But this reasoning is premised on a conceptual error. Biden’s problem is not a bad debate, it’s more the sad reality his debate performance revealed: He is no longer capable of reliably achieving even bare competence when communicating with the public.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was apparent in <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/transcript-read-full-biden-interview-lester-holt-nbc-news-rcna162029">his interview</a> with Lester Holt of NBC Monday night. Throughout, Biden frequently spoke in clipped sentences through a hoarse voice. He struggled with the core task of a politician in a Q&amp;A: directing the conversation back to one’s talking points in a manner that seems neither strained nor incoherent. Asked about whether he has concerns with the performance of the Secret Service, Biden spoke about how he’s now more reluctant to get out and shake hands with people in the wake of Saturday’s assassination attempt, then clumsily tried to connect this to January 6:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">I like to walk out, shake hands, move, look at people in the eye, see what they’re thinking. It’s really curtailed that ability on my part and on everybody’s part. And so because there’s a heightened notion that when you say there’s nothing wrong with going to the Capitol, breaking in, threatening people, a couple cops dying, hanging — put — putting up a noose, a gallows for — done for the vice — the former vice president.﻿</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Biden was asked about whether it was acceptable to him that the head of the Secret Service hadn’t made a public statement, the president said, “Oh, I’ve heard from him” — despite the fact that the head of the Secret Service is a woman.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s Oval Office remarks Sunday night were similarly lackluster. Addressing the nation following the assassination attempt against Trump, Biden proved unable to successfully execute a short speech, even while reading from a teleprompter. The president aimed to say that “in America, we resolve our differences at the ballot box” instead of “with bullets.” Instead, he said that “we resolve our differences at the battle box” — then, evidently trying and failing to correct himself, he continued, “You know, that’s how we do it, at the battle box, not with bullets.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By itself, the president accidentally suggesting that America’s political conflicts should be resolved in some sort of ultimate fighting arena would be of little consequence. But Biden’s flub underscores his campaign’s fatal flaw. A bad debate will fall out of the news, but a candidate’s increasingly limited capacities for effective communication will not. Biden’s decline will constrain his capacity to convey favorable political narratives while perpetually introducing new negative news stories spotlighting voters’ top concern with his candidacy. The president’s Oval Office address Sunday and recent press conference gave him a rare chance to ingratiate himself and his party to a large national audience. Due to Biden’s limitations, these functioned less as opportunities to exploit than hazards to survive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this said, Democrats who still have faith in Biden aren’t the problem. It is the lawmakers who believe that their party would do better if he stepped aside — but are doing nothing to bring that about — who are most derelict in their duties.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such Democrats may tell themselves there’s no point in pressuring Biden to step down since their party is doomed either way. But this is a rationalization for cowardice, not an unblinkered appraisal of reality.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Accepting a second Trump administration as inevitable is not rational, given the available data. And doing so is not moral, given the stakes of keeping an illiberal reactionary out of power. Democrats have a path to victory. Some would simply rather avoid personal risk or discomfort than take it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you live in the US, there’s a good chance you’re one of the approximately<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/php/statistics/2020-water-fluoridation-statistics.html"> 209 million people</a> drinking tap water that contains added fluoride. Local governments have been putting fluoride in city water supplies for <a href="https://www.wired.com/2008/01/dayintech-0125/">nearly 80 years</a>. In many ways, its addition has been a remarkable public health success: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drinking fluoridated water <a href="https://dph.illinois.gov/topics-services/prevention-wellness/oral-health/fast-facts-oral-health/fluoride-prevent-decay.html#:~:text=According%20to%20CDC%2C%20drinking%20water,reduces%20tooth%20decay%20by%2025%25.">reduces tooth decay by 25 percent</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in late August, the US National Toxicology Program (NTP) published a long-awaited <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fluoride-water-brain-neurology-iq-0a671d2de3b386947e2bd5a661f437a5">report</a> declaring, with “moderate confidence,” that drinking water with elevated fluoride levels is linked to lower IQ in children.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fluoride in our drinking water has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1KvgtEnABY">inspired conspiracy theories</a> for generations. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is also a prominent anti-vaxxer and Covid-19 skeptic, is one of the most <a href="https://fluoridealert.org/content/rfk-jr-michael-connett-fluoride-lawsuit/">vocal proponents</a> of banning fluoridation to protect children from neurodevelopmental problems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This, though, isn’t a conspiracy theory. Scientists have spent decades <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/11571/fluoride-in-drinking-water-a-scientific-review-of-epas-standards">trying to figure out</a> what level of fluoride strikes the best balance between oral health and healthy brain development. The NTP’s new <a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/whatwestudy/assessments/noncancer/completed/fluoride">324-page report</a> reviews results from over 500 experiments, lending more weight to the idea that fluoride can be connected to brain problems than, say, a single fraudulent, <a href="https://time.com/5175704/andrew-wakefield-vaccine-autism/">now-retracted study</a> linking vaccines to autism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Science is a frustratingly non-linear process. Facts that seemed unquestionable a decade ago can be overturned by new data at any moment. If you’ve never thought about fluoride outside of the dentist’s office, hearing that it might have neurotoxic effects could be confusing, scary, or infuriating. Why is fluoride still in our water and toothpaste, then?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not because dentists and scientists are lying to us (although <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/368350/scientific-research-fraud-crime-jail-time">sometimes they do</a>). It’s because finding the whole, unshakable truth is a never-ending process.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, don’t throw out your toothpaste and stockpile bottled water just yet. Here’s what the science says (and doesn’t say) about fluoride and the brain.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why does the government want us to drink fluoride?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fluoride is a mineral found naturally in soil, water, and things we consume, like <a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/fluoride/">brewed tea and shellfish</a>. It’s also in the toothpaste most of us use. Fluoride <a href="https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/oral-health/brush-oral-health/understanding-how-fluoride-helps-prevent-repair-tooth-decay">strengthens our enamel</a> and prevents cavities. It’s about more than maintaining pearly white teeth; left untreated, <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/10946-cavities">tooth decay</a> leads to severe infection, which can spread throughout the entire body.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the turn of the 20th century, dental researchers noticed that many people living near high-fluoride water sources had splotches on their teeth, a condition called fluorosis. Once scientists began <a href="https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/health-info/fluoride/the-story-of-fluoridation">studying the effects of fluoride on dental health</a>, they realized that, while fluoride can damage teeth and bones at high concentrations, drinking water with low levels of fluoride actually prevents tooth decay. Today, many cities add a small amount of fluoride to their tap water — about 0.7 milligrams per liter (mg/L).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But around 1.9 million people in the US live in areas where <a href="https://undark.org/2024/05/06/tap-water-high-dose-of-fluoride/">tap water naturally contains more fluoride</a> than the government recommends, according to the report. For example, the <a href="https://www.twdb.texas.gov/groundwater/aquifer/majors/ogallala.asp">Ogallala Aquifer</a>, which provides water for West Texas, is infused with fluoride-rich volcanic ash, bringing its <a href="https://nccd.cdc.gov/DOH_MWF/Default/Default.aspx" data-type="link" data-id="https://nccd.cdc.gov/DOH_MWF/Default/Default.aspx">fluoride concentrations</a> up to a whopping 5 mg/L.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The report linked fluoride levels of 1.5 mg/L — about twice the level <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4547570/">recommended by federal health officials</a> — with lower IQ in children. According to the NTP, more research is needed to figure out whether there are also risks associated with higher levels of fluoride for adults, or with the lower concentrations the government recommends.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While these findings have been reproduced enough times to be worth taking seriously, the science of intelligence — including the concept of IQ itself — is questionable.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Measuring brain development is complicated&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Measuring brain function isn’t straightforward. After all, the brain has many functions: keeping the body alive, helping us walk and talk, guiding our learning and decision-making.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than 70 of the 100 human studies reviewed by the NTP specifically looked at children’s IQ as a proxy for brain development — IQ tests are easier and cheaper to run than, say, brain scans or full neurological exams. Of those 72 IQ-related studies, only 19 were flagged by the NTP as having a low risk of bias, controlling for factors like socioeconomic status, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4641149/">which could also contribute</a> to differences in IQ scores. Only a handful of those 19 studies were conducted in North America, and none in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, critically, none of these human studies tell us anything about how fluoride changes the brain at a biological level. Even studies in lab animals and cells did not identify how fluoride might affect learning, memory, or intelligence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;IQ scores also only capture an incomplete picture of early childhood brain development and are tangled up in a number of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3270016/">socioeconomic</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/08/jason-richwine-race-iq-genetics-095765">racial,</a> and <a href="https://nrcgt.uconn.edu/newsletters/winter052/">cultural</a> factors beyond how much fluoride someone is exposed to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/pov/films/refrigeratormothers/">mothers were blamed</a> for their children’s cognitive disabilities. Redirecting that blame to environmental factors like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684109/autism-vaccines-treatment-cure-bleach">MMR vaccines</a> — or, say, fluoridated water — can give parents a sense of control over scary-sounding diagnoses. A 2017 <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/does-fluoride-drinking-water-lower-iq-question-looms-large-court-battle#:~:text=The%20fluoride%20lawsuit%20is%20the,a%20%E2%80%9Cscientifically%20defensible%20basis.%E2%80%9D">federal lawsuit</a> calling on the EPA to ban water fluoridation already has the <a href="https://fluoridealert.org/content/rfk-jr-michael-connett-fluoride-lawsuit/">enthusiastic support of high-profile anti-vaxxers</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The trial hinges on the results of NTP’s final report, a draft of which was originally presented over a year ago. The drawn-out legal battle has been <a href="https://undark.org/2024/03/06/fluoride-drinking-water/">messy</a>, with dental health advocates obstructing fluoride research and <a href="https://fluoridealert.org/content/national-toxicology-program-finds-no-safe-level-of-fluoride-in-drinking-water-water-fluoridation-policy-threatened/">denying the NTP’s findings</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the court decides fluoride poses health risks that outweigh its benefits, it could end water fluoridation in the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid scientific uncertainty and political shadiness, it’s hard to know what to believe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who should I believe? What should I do?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, the NTP has simply determined “with moderate confidence” that there is a correlation between higher fluoride exposure and lower IQ in children — specifically, IQs 2 to 5 points lower.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s hard to know how we would measure the differences in lived experiences based on a few IQ points.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re concerned about your family’s fluoride exposure, you can check your tap water’s fluoride levels on the CDC’s <a href="https://nccd.cdc.gov/DOH_MWF/Default/SearchByWaterSystem.aspx">My Water’s Fluoride page</a>. If you happen to live somewhere with levels above around 1.5 mg/L, your tap water crosses the threshold of neurodevelopmental concern. No need to switch to bottled water, though; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-under-sink-water-filter/">home water purifiers</a> can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3793412/">filter fluoride out completely</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To make sure you don’t throw out the oral health benefits of fluoride with the bathwater, keep using fluoride toothpaste for those <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6804a3.htm#:~:text=However%2C%20ingestion%20of%20too%20much,toothpaste%20at%20age%202%20years.">over the age of 2</a> (just don’t swallow it).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And if you’re still fluoride-skeptical, you can order some <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/07/toothpaste-fluoride-hydroxyapatite/679200/">hydroxyapatite toothpaste</a> — which has similar cavity-preventive benefits — from Europe or Canada, where it’s been approved and endorsed by dental associations.<br><br><em>This story originally appeared in </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter"><strong><em>Today, Explained</em></strong></a><em>, Vox’s flagship daily newsletter. </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/today-explained-newsletter-signup"><strong><em>Sign up here for future editions</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris has <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/">pulled slightly ahead</a> in national polls against former President Donald Trump. Still, the race is pretty tight, and it looks like it will remain that way until Election Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite polling errors that <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/mistakes-to-avoid-polls.html">overestimated</a> Democrats’ performance in the popular vote in 2016 and 2020, head-to-head polls are still the best signal of what the election outcome will be — though it’s important to keep in mind that no single poll will be exactly right, and that some polls have better methodologies than others.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But head-to-head polling isn’t the only way to gauge the state of play. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/index-of-presidential-election-indicators/">Other</a> election <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/24490/key-election-indicators.aspx">indicators</a> — ranging from approval ratings and sentiments among key groups of voters to economic measures and campaign spending — all provide crucial context about where the electorate and this campaign are headed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are some factors beyond topline numbers that we think are especially crucial to help you gain a fuller understanding of the race.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Biden’s approval rating</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden may have stepped aside from the Democratic nomination, but that doesn’t mean he’s irrelevant: Biden’s approval rating is a proxy for how voters feel about his administration — one whose record Harris has for the most part defended.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would be a worrying sign for Harris if that number — which already made Biden <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/12/biden-polling-drop-out/">historically unpopular</a> before he dropped out — stagnates or goes down before the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That “would be a negative verdict on the incumbent administration, which she is part of,” said <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/kyle-d-kondik/">Kyle Kondik</a>, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political analysis newsletter, at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. “I wouldn’t take that as predictive on its own, but I do think the president’s approval rating still merits watching, even though he’s not a candidate anymore.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has so far managed to both take credit for Biden’s popular policies and decouple herself from his <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/14/kamala-harris-economy-inflation">most unpopular</a> policies. Her approval rating is about 42 percent, up from about 38 percent when Biden dropped out on July 21, according to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">FiveThirtyEight’s polling average</a>. Biden, on the other hand, so far hasn’t gotten the kind of boost that many people thought he might after dropping out: His approval rating is only up <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">about 2 percentage points</a> to 41 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That number could be a liability for Harris because “Republicans are gonna do their damage to connect all of the unpopular things with Biden to Harris,” Kondik said. “It’s just the question of whether it works or not. I don’t think it’s worked yet.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/zB6P3-biden-s-approval-rating-could-reflect-on-harris.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,19.202340622113,100,61.595318755775" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Trump’s favorability rating</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For nine years now, more Americans have viewed Trump more unfavorably than favorably. But Trump&#8217;s favorability is also rising notably, suggesting that he has expanded his appeal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That may be because the memory of his first term, when he was <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/01/18/trump-approval-rating-average-popularity/">incredibly unpopular</a>, has faded somewhat in the public’s consciousness. What voters may remember fondly is that the economy was doing well under his presidency until the pandemic hit. Other voters may just like that he’s not Harris or Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think to some degree, independents have less of a negative association with him now that he’s out of office and has been for a while, and they weren’t really happy with the Biden administration,” said <a href="https://split-ticket.org/author/lakshyajain97/">Lakshya Jain</a>, a partner at the political forecasting firm Split Ticket.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has maintained a strong base of support among Republicans, leveraging the <a href="https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations">numerous indictments</a> against him to make the case that he has been targeted as an anti-establishment candidate. He’s also made overtures to moderates, including by <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/29/trump-measure-overturn-florida-six-week-abortion-ban-00176809">somewhat dialing back</a> the restrictive Republican stance on abortion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, however, it would be wrong to say that Trump is popular.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I wouldn’t say he’s cracked through a massive ceiling on favorability, because his negatives are still [high],” Jain said. Indeed, they’re currently more than <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/">10 percentage points higher</a> on average than his favorability ratings.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/dnhnN-trump-s-favorability-ratings-have-improved-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.050459661129,100,63.899080677743" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether these unfavorable numbers move as the campaign kicks into high gear in the fall and people get reacquainted with the former president remains to be seen. If they rise, that could signal trouble for Trump on Election Day.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The share of undecided voters in major battleground states</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polls in battleground states suggest that Harris and Trump are practically in a dead heat. That means even the few percent of voters who remain undecided could tip the scales one way or the other. Keeping an eye on these voters will be key to understanding what to expect in each of the swing states.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/gwicK-undecided-voters-could-make-the-difference.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, it’s hard to assess what way they’re leaning: Because there are so few undecided voters, pollsters often can’t get an accurate read on how they’re feeling. Demographically, they tend to be a bit younger and more diverse than the rest of the electorate, and they also tend to skew a bit more female. All of that would “suggest that Kamala Harris would have more upside with them,” said <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/about/staff/david-wasserman">David Wasserman</a>, senior editor and elections analyst at the Cook Political Report.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that doesn’t mean Democrats should assume they now have an edge in swing states. These undecided voters also exhibit traits that might make them lean toward Trump. Wasserman said they are more distrustful of institutions and government, tend to work blue-collar jobs, have less than a four-year college degree, have broad dissatisfaction with the two-party system, and believe that the Biden administration has mishandled the economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These are cross-pressured voters who may not turn out to vote at all at the end of the day, but that is a group that we’re watching closely,” Wasserman said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Harris’s growth among key groups of voters&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has shown the potential to improve with groups of voters who Biden had struggled with and are projected to play a key role in the election — like independents, Hispanic voters, and infrequent voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That last group was of particular concern for Biden. When he was the nominee, some strategists suggested that higher turnout would hurt Democrats because infrequent voters were <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/meet-sporadic-voters-decide-2024-election-rcna158374">less likely to support him</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There was an overwhelming sentiment among infrequent voters that Biden would not be able to fulfill his responsibilities for a second term, and for the first half of the year, Democrats were publicly in denial about that,” Wasserman said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But among registered voters who did not vote in 2020, Harris improved by 9 percentage points in New York Times/Siena College polls conducted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">before</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/10/us/elections/times-siena-poll-pennsylvania-toplines.html">after Biden dropped out</a>, suggesting that she has narrowed Trump’s advantage with that group. That growth suggests she has appeal with voters who aren’t hardcore partisans — and that she might have further opportunities for growth.   </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/E3UTl-harris-appears-to-be-gaining-among-key-voters.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,4.9156486329261,100,90.168702734148" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Any significant movement among Black and Latino voters toward Trump is also notable and could prove decisive in certain swing states. In 2020, Trump made gains with Latinos not just in Florida and Texas, but <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/republican-latino-voters-donald-trump-pennsylvania-20240826.html">also in Pennsylvania</a>. Black voters will play a key role in Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and some of them <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-polls-black-voters-donald-trump-national-polling-average-1942378">appear to be moving toward Trump</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s lower-propensity Black voters who are open to voting for Trump, and they are not guaranteed to show up. But even so, if Trump wins 15 percent of the Black vote, that would likely be enough to tip Georgia and Michigan and Pennsylvania to the Republican column,” Wasserman said. “That means that Kamala Harris has to make it up somewhere else, and that’s hard.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2024/electoral-college-map?game-id=2024-PG-CNN-ratings&amp;game-view=map">still win after losing those three states</a>, Harris would likely need to sweep the rest of the swing states and pick up a large state that Democrats have struggled in, like North Carolina.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, Kondik said that he is skeptical any shift among Black voters would be large, and that polling errors might be overstating the extent to which Black voters are supporting Trump. “I think that’s a mirage,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Second-quarter economic growth</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If there’s a single issue most likely to determine the election, it’s probably the economy, which is at or near the top of issues that voters prioritize <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx">across</a> multiple <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/economy-key-insights-data-and-solutions-inflation-recession-consumer-confidence-and-more">polls</a>.<strong> </strong>The economy is also worth watching because it has previously had electoral significance. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A key variable in Sabato’s Crystal Ball’s <a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/time-for-change-model-predicts-close-election-with-slight-edge-for-kamala-harris/">election forecasting model</a> is economic growth leading up to an election: specifically, second-quarter percent change in gross domestic product (GDP),<strong> </strong>the total value of goods and services produced in the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That change has “proven to be historically electorally important,” Kondik said. Sabato’s didn’t use it in their 2020 model because the pandemic contributed to a big downturn in economic growth that would have suggested Trump would lose in a landslide, which seemed unlikely — and indeed, he ended up losing what was a tight race.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s no reason to believe that this year is similarly exceptional.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If there’s a big crash, the incumbent party almost always suffers some sort of penalty. This is kind of what doomed John McCain in 2008,” Jain said.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/CI8kn-economic-growth-has-been-electorally-important-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,18.907343884777,100,62.185312230447" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Interest rates</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in mid-2022, increasing borrowing costs and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/consumer-confidence-conference-board-economy-spending-3dfae1c18dba90aaeba2b5a4e3ce9567">dampening consumer confidence in the economy</a> through much of this year. The Fed’s goal was to get high inflation under control; now that inflation has cooled, the Fed is expected to finally <a href="https://apnews.com/article/consumer-confidence-conference-board-economy-spending-3dfae1c18dba90aaeba2b5a4e3ce9567">cut rates again in September</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/RsW6m-interest-rates-coming-down-could-help-harris-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.809066478228,100,66.381867043544" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">A rate cut might not be a complete game-changer for Harris, especially since “a lot of the effect of the economy on the election is already ‘baked in’ at this late date” in that most people have already made up their minds about the Biden administration’s performance on the issue, said <a href="https://as.vanderbilt.edu/political-science/bio/john-sides/">John Sides</a>, political science professor at Vanderbilt University.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, it might give her more ammunition to fight off Republican attacks on Biden’s economic record. Not only would it provide some immediate relief to homeowners and homebuyers by bringing down mortgage interest rates, it would also signal that the Fed is willing to step in to help workers in a <a href="https://time.com/6287012/why-finding-job-is-difficult/">tougher job market</a>. A rate cut would ease financial pressure on businesses that kept them from hiring as much as they were during the pandemic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has blamed Harris and Biden for high inflation and household debt and promised to reinstate “<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?537985-1/president-trump-delivers-remarks-potterville-michigan-economy">the best economy in the history of our country</a>,” which he falsely<strong> </strong>claimed was during his first term. (His term saw an annual average of between <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=US">2 and 3 percent GDP growth</a>, not counting the pandemic economy of 2020, while yearly GDP growth averaged nearly <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?locations=US">5 percent in the 1960s</a>.) That has proved persuasive among the majority of voters who <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-edge-over-harris-economy-crime-slips-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2024-08-27/">prefer him to Harris</a> on the issue, but Harris has also closed that gap somewhat. Harris has argued that she and Biden inherited an economic mess from Trump and have largely managed to clean it up: inflation is down, growth has remained <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/u-s-economic-growth-revised-up-to-solid-3-percent-annual-rate-for-second-quarter-of-2024#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94%20The%20U.S.,upgrade%20of%20its%20initial%20assessment.">relatively strong</a>, and the labor market is still on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/us-added-818000-fewer-jobs-thought-adding-concerns-economy-rcna167555">solid footing</a> despite a recent downturn in job growth, all without triggering a recession. However, it’s not clear how effective that argument is among consumers who are still struggling with higher prices and more debt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In general, I think a rate cut would be a bit of welcome ‘good news’ for the Harris campaign that might help weaken the Trump campaign’s economic argument,” Sides said.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The difference in Democratic and Republican spending in key states</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The amount of dollars spent in presidential elections by each party <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/364964/harris-trump-fundraising-donations-campaign-2024">isn’t necessarily predictive</a> of election outcomes. Piles of cash can’t compensate for poor spending decisions or bad candidates. And there are diminishing returns on ad spending.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the difference in party spending in major battleground states can reveal something about which party has momentum where, and how competitive they perceive that state to be, Jain said. If one party is being outspent by the other in a particular state, that can indicate one of two things: either they think they already have it in the bag and don’t need to spend more, or they’ve backed off because it doesn’t seem winnable and are focusing their resources elsewhere. As of now, Republicans are being outspent in a few battlegrounds where Trump is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/michigan/">not</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/wisconsin/">polling</a> as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/nevada/">well</a> as Harris (though it’s very close).</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/M3D74-democrats-have-outspent-republicans-in-major-battleground-states-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,26.57955773139,100,46.84088453722" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond the major battlegrounds, it’s also important to pay attention to spending aimed at expanding the map for either Republicans or Democrats. Any money spent outside Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, and Nebraska (which <a href="https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/nebraska-and-maine-split-their-electoral-vote-is-it-a-better-system-than-winner-take-all/">allocates three of its five electoral votes</a> to whichever candidate wins the vote in its three electoral districts) might signal as much. Notably, it seems that both parties are planning to <a href="https://time.com/7009161/battleground-swing-states-2024-election/">spend fairly heavily</a> in states including Texas and Florida this fall. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That would suggest that Democrats see some path to victory in those traditionally Republican states that isn’t immediately obvious to observers lacking their internal polling, that they feel secure enough in other key states to spend money on long shots, or that they feel they have enough money to force the GOP to “waste” money on states that should be safe for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m really curious to see if there’s any heavy television spending in states other than the big seven, plus Nebraska,” Kondik said. “If money is spent in any other place, I’ll be interested in that. So, Republicans go on TV in Minneapolis, St. Paul, or Democrats go on TV this fall in Miami.” Such moves might indicate a party is feeling bullish about expanding the map.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-28/the-slowdown-in-us-electric-vehicle-sales-looks-more-like-a-blip">slowdown</a> in US sales, global forecasts for electric vehicles remain bullish. Countries across North America, Europe, and Asia are <a href="https://evmagazine.com/articles/germany-builds-nationwide-fast-charging-network-for-evs">expanding charger networks</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/01/19/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-announces-new-actions-to-cut-electric-vehicle-costs-for-americans-and-continue-building-out-a-convenient-reliable-made-in-america-ev-charging-network/">offering EV subsidies</a>; global EV sales are <a href="https://about.bnef.com/blog/electric-vehicle-sales-headed-for-record-year-but-growth-slowdown-puts-climate-targets-at-risk-according-to-bloombergnef-report/">projected</a> to nearly triple by 2030, reaching 40 million vehicles annually.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The incipient wave of EV purchases raises a question: What will happen to the millions of gas-powered cars whose owners no longer want them?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The likely answer: Rather than scrapping used gas vehicles or selling them domestically, rich nations will dispatch them to developing countries where limited incomes and low levels of car ownership have created eager buyers for even older, substandard models.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An influx of used gas cars would be a welcome development for those in the Global South who aspire to automobile ownership, a luxury that many in affluent countries take for granted. But it would undermine efforts to mitigate climate change, since shifting gas guzzlers from one country to another doesn’t lower global emissions. For developing countries themselves, a sharp increase in car ownership could amplify calls to build auto-reliant infrastructure, making it harder to construct the dense neighborhoods and transit networks that can foster more sustainable growth. And since these imported used cars would be fueled by gasoline, air quality would further decline in cities that are already choked with smog.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The world is in an era of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23920997/polycrisis-climate-pandemic-population-connectivity">polycrisis</a>, facing concurrent challenges including climate change, toxic air, and extreme inequality. Difficult trade-offs are often inevitable. Such is the case with the thorny issue of what to do with the millions of gas cars that the rich world will discard as its fleets are electrified. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Electrification is a necessary goal. And it’s natural for people in the developing world to desire the same luxuries that characterize middle-class comfort in wealthier countries. The question is how to manage a transition with enormous stakes that has largely been ignored. The experts who do pay attention are growing alarmed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m really worried that everything is going to be gas vehicles for many years, maybe decades,” said <a href="https://webapps.knust.edu.gh/staff/dirsearch/profile/summary/9a6c1c63db46.html">Godwin Ayetor</a>, a senior lecturer in engineering at Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology. “I’m worried about the health implications, and also the congestion. It’s already difficult to walk through Accra because of all the traffic, and the cars keep coming.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today’s steady flow of used cars into the Global South could become a torrent as the rich world electrifies. A deluge of gas vehicles would be a double-edged sword for low-income nations — and a risk to the planet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How used cars move from rich nations to poor ones</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although it generates few headlines, a massive industry transports used cars across borders every day, with exporters collecting lower-quality models from dealers and wholesale auctions. Ayetor noted that colonial legacies are reflected in the trade flows: the UK, with its car cabins designed for drivers who keep to the left, tends to ship to former colonies like Kenya and Tanzania that still follow the same rules.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/used-vehicles-and-environment-global-overview-used-light-duty-vehicles-flow-scale">a report issued in June</a> by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), some 3.1 million used cars were exported in 2022, up from 2.4 million in 2015. Most come from Japan, Europe, and the United States. (In the US, <a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles">around 7 percent</a> of all cars no longer in use are sent abroad. The rest end up in junkyards where their parts and materiel are sold off.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About one in three exported used vehicles is destined for Africa, followed by Eastern Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Imported models often dominate local auto sales, since international carmakers send few new vehicles to the Global South and rarely establish production facilities there. (In sub-Saharan Africa, only South Africa has local factories.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The developing world’s demand for cars is robust, in large part because comparatively few people own one. According to <a href="https://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/Total-World-vehicles-in-use-2020.pdf">one 2020 estimate</a>, the US had 860 cars for every 1,000 residents, while South Africa had 176, Morocco 112, and Nigeria just 56. Meanwhile, growing populations provide a steady supply of new potential customers. Africa is home to all of the world’s 20 <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/population-growth-rate/country-comparison/">fastest-growing countries</a>, with Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Niger, and Uganda expanding their populations by at least 3 percent per year. (For comparison, the US population is growing at a 0.67 percent rate).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As long as their price is right, aged or damaged used cars will be snapped up in the Global South. Many vehicles shipped from abroad have been in crashes, stripped of parts, or manufactured decades ago, when emissions and safety rules were more lax. A <a href="https://www.ilent.nl/binaries/ilt/documenten/leefomgeving-en-wonen/stoffen-en-producten/chemische-stoffen-en-mengsels/rapporten/used-vehicles-exported-to-africa/Used+vehicles+exported+to+Africa.pdf">2020 study</a> by the government of the Netherlands found that most Dutch used cars sent to Africa lacked a roadworthiness certificate; many were manufactured over 20 years ago. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Old cars mean old technologies,” said Ayetor, “and old technologies means they don’t have modern systems to reduce the impact of the emissions before they leach out into the atmosphere.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wealthy countries have generally turned a blind eye to the shoddy quality of used cars sent overseas; they are profitable transactions for domestic businesses and the risks are largely borne elsewhere. “Most countries do not impose significant restrictions on trading unroadworthy or highly polluting vehicles,” concluded a <a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles">recent study</a> by the International Transport Forum, the transportation arm of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The receiving countries can also take a laissez faire approach. About half the 146 nations examined by UNEP do not regulate used car age or quality. Others have adopted policies such as barring used car imports outright (<a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2024-05-22-illegally-imported-used-cars-cost-sa-and-the-consumer-dearly/#:~:text=SA%20outlaws%20the%20importation%20of,Kia%20SA%20CEO%20Gary%20Scott.">as in South Africa</a>), banning older cars (<a href="https://unece.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/WP.29-187-17e.pdf">as in Kenya</a>, where imported vehicles must be less than eight years old), and scaling import tax rates with the age of the vehicle (<a href="https://www.trade.gov/market-intelligence/ghana-customs-valuation-used-vehicles">as in Ghana</a>). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Adjacent nations may have different import rules, however, which creates loopholes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What happens is that vehicles are exported to one country, and then they go to neighboring countries as well,” said Joseph Mashele, who was an automotive regulator in South Africa before recently joining Jaguar Land Rover.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Case in point: Despite South Africa’s official ban on used cars, tens of thousands still <a href="https://www.businesslive.co.za/bd/national/2024-05-22-illegally-imported-used-cars-cost-sa-and-the-consumer-dearly/#:~:text=SA%20outlaws%20the%20importation%20of,Kia%20SA%20CEO%20Gary%20Scott.">arrive annually</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Really shady cars make it into emerging economies, because there is still a market for them,” said Andreas Kopf, an author of the ITF’s recent report. His team found that roughly a quarter of used cars sent to the developing world adhere to emissions standards that are at least 21 years old.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of these cars lack modern safety features and pollution controls that are commonplace in newer vehicles made in wealthier countries. That is a particular concern in Africa, which despite its low level of car ownership still has the world’s highest rates of <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/road-traffic-injuries">road deaths</a> and <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/02-05-2018-9-out-of-10-people-worldwide-breathe-polluted-air-but-more-countries-are-taking-action#:~:text=The%20highest%20ambient%20air%20pollution,Africa%20and%20the%20Western%20Pacific.">some of its dirtiest air</a>, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, the developing world’s voracious appetite for used cars has caught the attention of senior leaders in China, an <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/china-has-become-an-electric-vehicle-export-behemoth-how-should-the-us-and-eu-respond/">emerging colossus</a> of automotive manufacturing. Until 2019, China banned the export of used vehicles, focusing instead on supplying its burgeoning domestic market. Now those restrictions have been removed, and the Chinese government is <a href="https://m.mofcom.gov.cn/article/bnjg/202110/20211003211557.shtml">actively promoting</a> the used car trade because it can attract foreign currency and stoke domestic demand for automaking heavyweights like BYD and Geely. By sending older gas-powered cars out of the country, China can also nudge residents to buy new EVs, which the government favors with <a href="https://www.csis.org/blogs/trustee-china-hand/chinese-ev-dilemma-subsidized-yet-striking">subsidies</a> and a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-19/china-cash-for-clunkers-to-fuel-26-billion-more-electric-vehicle-sales?utm_source=fot.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=trucks-fot-buffalo-cruise-uber-auriga&amp;_bhlid=ca393710e3b76fcad69280e33e2e5885a425e60a">cash-for-clunkers program</a> that provides money to those trading in an older-model car.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You can just pull existing internal combustion engine cars out of your fleet, and then you stimulate new sales,” Kopf said. “This is what they are doing in China.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although China exported <a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles">only 40,000 used cars in 2022</a>, that figure is expected to skyrocket. According to the ITF’s analysis, Chinese used car exports may total <a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles">8 million vehicles annually</a> within the next decade, more than double current trade flows from Europe, East Asia, and North America combined.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, China’s future trade in used cars could be dwarfed by a tsunami of gas vehicles set to depart the wealthy world. Its cause: Electrification.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Electrification will push even more vehicles to the developing world</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With privately owned automobiles responsible for <a href="https://www.iea.org/energy-system/transport/cars-and-vans">about 10 percent</a> of global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (and <a href="https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/carbon-pollution-transportation">more than twice that share</a> in the US), wealthy nations are rightly moving to electrify their vehicles as quickly as possible. The European Union, for instance, has <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/digest/eu-gas-car-phaseout-2035#:~:text=Around%20a%20quarter%20of%20EU,%2C%20Romania%2C%20and%20Italy%20abstained.">committed</a> to ending the sales of gas-powered cars by 2035, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-to-phase-out-gasoline-powered-cars-bucking-toyota-chief-11608887640">around the same time</a> as Japan. In the US, the Biden administration has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html">vowed</a> that a majority of new cars will be all-electric or hybrid by 2032.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In May, electric and hybrid vehicles represented a little less than <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/eu-electric-car-sales-drop-may-german-demand-slumps-industry-says-2024-06-20/#:~:text=Electrified%20vehicles%20%2D%20fully%20electric%20models,to%2029.9%25%20from%2025%25.">half</a> of new car sales in the European Union and under <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/articles/percentage-of-electric-cars-in-us.html#:~:text=If%20we're%20talking%20about,1.6%20percentage%20points%20from%202022.">7 percent</a> in the US. But as electrification ramps up, the Global North’s demand for gas cars — including used ones — will wane.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The total number of cars in rich countries is relatively constant,” said Kopf. “That means that if an EV is entering the fleet, a combustion engine is leaving.” With fewer people shopping for a used gas car within rich countries, more will likely be sent abroad — potentially a whole lot more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Norway, the world’s most aggressive adopter of EVs, provides a preview of what’s to come. With the government providing an array of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23939076/norway-electric-vehicle-cars-evs-tesla-oslo">generous incentives</a>, Norwegians have gone all-in on electric models, which comprise <a href="https://alternative-fuels-observatory.ec.europa.eu/general-information/news/norwegian-ev-market-surges-915-market-share-setting-sustainable-example#:~:text=7%20April%202024-,Norwegian%20EV%20Market%20Surges%20to%2091.5%25%20Market%20Share%2C%20Setting%20a,from%2091.1%25%20the%20previous%20year.">over 90 percent</a> of new car purchases. <a href="https://elbil.no/om-elbil/elbilstatistikk/elbilbestand/">Around one in four cars</a> on the road in Norway is now electric, compared to <a href="https://www.edmunds.com/electric-car/articles/how-many-electric-cars-in-us.html">under 2 percent</a> in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Norway’s EV embrace has triggered a veritable explosion in exports of used gas vehicles: They more than <a href="https://www.itf-oecd.org/new-used-global-trade-second-hand-electric-vehicles">quadrupled</a><em> </em>in the decade from 2012 to 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As other rich nations electrify their own fleets, ITF’s Kopf said he anticipates “similar behavior” to what Norway has experienced. If <a href="https://sustmob.org/PCFV/LightDutyVehicles_Report_June2024.pdf">used car exports</a> in Europe, East Asia, and North America match Norway’s trajectory, those regions would collectively ship 12 million gas vehicles per year, on top of the potentially 8 million coming from China. A total of 20 million used gas cars exported annually to developing nations would be seven times greater than current levels. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That would be welcome news for those in lower-income nations who yearn to own their own car, since the laws of supply and demand predict that a growing supply of used vehicles would lower their market price. Ayetor said that “a lot of Africans are hoping” that such a scenario unfolds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <a href="https://www.unep.org/people/jane-akumu">Jane Akumu</a>, a Nairobi-based transport expert at UNEP, said that used car buyers in the Global South should be careful what they wish for, because aged models may not be the bargain that they appear. “If you are importing 20-year-old cars, you have to bring in an equal shipment of parts, because they will break down so quickly,” she told me, noting that immobile cars can clog motorways, thickening traffic as well as smog.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Theoretically, an influx of used cars could reduce emissions and breakdowns if newer, cleaner vehicles were displacing the older and dirtier models currently in use. But no one I spoke with expects that to happen. Instead, imported gas guzzlers would be added to the existing fleet — increasing total pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A new used car is not going to replace an older one; it&#8217;s just going to be absorbed,” Kopf said. “So you&#8217;ll have the 30-year-old car running around, plus the new 10-year-old car.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.2.4.58">2010 study</a> of used cars shipped from the US to Mexico supports his point: The authors found that although imported cars were cleaner than the average Mexican car, their arrival still increased total emissions because they added to, rather than supplanted, the preexisting vehicle fleet.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The world needs a plan to adapt</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The risks of aged, polluting cars sent abroad will not be borne by the Global South alone. Climate change is a planetary phenomenon; driving a gas guzzler produces the same amount of emissions in Lusaka as it would in London or Los Angeles. Reducing greenhouse gasses requires reducing total vehicle emissions, not just shifting their location.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an ideal world, electrification would enable the rich world to scrap its most decrepit gas cars. Instead, wealthy nations are likely to ship them to poorer countries, which will be left to figure out what to do when even the most <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2KTPmrT8xY">MacGyver-like</a> mechanics cannot keep them running.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“All of your worst vehicles end up here,” Ayetor said. “When we want to get rid of the vehicle, what do we do?” No wealthy nations currently screen exported vehicles to weed out those that flunk basic quality tests, Kopf said. But that may soon change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The European Union is now <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_23_3819">considering new regulations</a> that would prohibit exporting “<a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/topics/waste-and-recycling/end-life-vehicles_en">end of life</a>” vehicles, requiring that cars shipped abroad obtain a certificate confirming their roadworthiness. Its adoption would be a “game-changer,” according to UNEP’s Akumu. (She and Kopf said they know of no comparable proposals under consideration in North America.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Mashele noted that export controls provide only a partial solution. “Sometimes things happen in transit,” he said, “and certain equipment has been tampered with or removed,” making the vehicle more polluting or dangerous upon arrival than when leaving its port of origin. He wants to see stricter emissions and safety checks in the Global South, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those countries have a lot of policy work to do. <a href="http://sustmob.org/PCFV/LightDutyVehicles_Report_June2024.pdf">In 2023</a> the UNEP gave 57 developing nations a rating of “weak” or “very weak” for their vehicle import rules, with the bulk of them in Africa. But the UNEP did note some progress, such as the five East African countries that in 2022 <a href="https://www.unep.org/events/workshop/east-africa-sub-region-becomes-second-sub-region-africa-adopt-euro-4iv-equivalent">required</a> imported vehicles to adhere to the EU’s Euro 4 emissions standards, which were introduced in 2006. That move followed a <a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/west-african-ministers-adopt-cleaner-fuels-and-vehicles-standards">similar one in 2021</a> by a bloc of 15 West African countries, which stipulated that imported used cars follow Euro 4 and be less than 10 years old. Syncing such rules can prevent importers from circumventing countries with strong regulations by shipping to their less stringent neighbors instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if strict vehicle standards are applied universally, the number of used gas cars flowing into the developing world is still poised to rise as the rich world electrifies. As the ranks of car owners in the Global South expand, many are likely to demand new roads to drive on and more places to park. Bowing to such requests will be risky.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A century ago, American leaders built highways and reconfigured cities to accommodate the automobile, in the process locking the country into car-oriented development that has lengthened commutes, increased emissions, and undermined city life. The automobile’s dominance has also raised the cost of living: The average American spends <a href="https://itdp.org/2024/01/24/high-cost-transportation-united-states/#:~:text=According%20to%202023%20European,than%20the%20average%20American%20household.">16 percent</a> of their income on transportation in 2020, 5 percentage points higher than those in the denser and more transit-rich nations of the European Union.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">UNEP’s Akumu is already concerned by what she is seeing in Kenya. A few years ago, she said, nearly half of Nairobi’s children walked to school. But “that number keeps going down, because when you graduate in income, you want to own a car.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As incomes in the Global South grow, density and robust transit service could make driving an option rather than a necessity. For example, South Korea and Taiwan became wealthy nations in the latter half of the 20th century, and both built excellent mass transportation systems. <a href="https://www.oica.net/wp-content/uploads/Total-World-vehicles-in-use-2020.pdf">In 2020</a>, their rates of car ownership (458 per 1,000 people in South Korea and 344 per 1,000 in Taiwan) were far below the US (860 per 1,000).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Investing in multimodal infrastructure now could help lower-income countries avoid the planning mistakes that the US made a century ago. Many residents of the Global South are understandably eager to purchase their first motor vehicle, but “we need to make sure that an influx of cars does not displace a potential buildup of public transportation,” Kopf said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A number of such projects are currently in the works, including new subways in <a href="https://societegenerale.africa/en/societe-generale-africa/news/news-details/news/abidjans-metro-line-1-the-biggest-public-transport-infrastructure-project-in-sub-saharan-africa/#:~:text=The%20Abidjan%20Metro%20Line%201,improve%20environmental%20and%20social%20conditions.">Abidjan</a> and <a href="https://www.stm.group/en/stm-celebrates-algiers-metro-milestone/">Algiers</a> and an <a href="https://www.railwaygazette.com/passenger/kinshasa-urban-train-aims-to-improve-transport-in-fast-growing-city/63666.article">urban rail network</a> in Kinshasa. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.tanzaniainvest.com/sgr#:~:text=According%20to%20comments%20made%20by,currently%20in%20the%20testing%20phase.">Tanzania</a> is revamping its rail system, while Botswana and Namibia are building a <a href="https://tkrpmo.com/">Trans-Kalahari Railway</a>. As World Bank transport researchers argued in <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/transport/investing-in-rail-can-help-put-african-cities-on-a-more-sustaina">a recent blog post</a>, “investing in rail can help put African cities on a more sustainable track,” noting that many existing tracks could be adjusted to ferry people as well as goods.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, that would be the wisest strategy to manage an impending glut of used gas cars: ensure that people can flourish without one, regardless of where they live.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most people are now probably familiar with the story: Two American astronauts were sent to space on an eight-day test mission on a new Boeing spacecraft in June. Now, nearly three months later, NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-decides-to-bring-starliner-spacecraft-back-to-earth-without-crew/">announced</a> that they’ll bring the astronauts back on a SpaceX Dragon capsule — which will not arrive until February 2025 for the return flight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Sunita “Suni” Williams, both veteran Navy pilots, rode in the Boeing Starliner capsule’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/liftoff-nasa-astronauts-pilot-first-starliner-crewed-test-to-station/">first crewed flight</a> to the International Space Station on June 5. But problems with helium leaks and thruster failures were subsequently discovered and have <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/364123/boeing-space-starliner-nasa-spacex-launch-test-flight-astronauts-iss">kept the astronauts</a> in space conducting <a href="https://spacenews.com/starliner-iss-stay-extended-to-complete-thruster-and-helium-leak-testing/">tests</a> to determine whether the Starliner could bring them safely back to Earth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">NASA now says that it would be safer for the pair to hitch a ride back to Earth next February with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/24/science/boeing-starliner-nasa-astronauts-spacex/index.html">SpaceX’s Crew Dragon</a>, a blow to Starliner maker Boeing, which NASA had <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-chooses-american-companies-to-transport-u-s-astronauts-to-international-space-station/">tapped</a> a decade ago along with SpaceX to provide <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/commercial-space/commercial-crew-program/">reliable transportation</a> to and from the space station.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the astronauts’ plight has elicited feelings of sympathy and pity, chemist and retired NASA astronaut Cady Coleman admits to feeling something different: jealousy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Coleman, author of <a href="https://www.porchlightbooks.com/product/sharing-space-an-astronauts-guide-to-mission-wonder-and-making-change--cady-coleman/isbn/9780593494011"><em>Sharing Space: An Astronaut&#8217;s Guide to Mission, Wonder, and Making Change</em>,</a> flew twice on the Space Shuttle and spent nearly six months on the International Space Station. She <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/stuck-in-space/id1346207297?i=1000666685713">told</a> <em>Today, Explained</em> host Sean Rameswaram that this is what astronauts dream of: more time in space. Their conversation below has been edited for length and clarity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>—Avishay Artsy</em>,<em> senior producer,</em> Today, Explained</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s space like, Cady?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cady Coleman</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I always have to take a breath and think how to say this, but it is like being transported to a different world. And I know I&#8217;m definitely still in this one same universe — look down, see Earth — but you really are at the edge, so to speak. And I felt really privileged to be one of the people who is the furthest away, meaning they&#8217;re basically the closest to everything else we haven&#8217;t seen.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And one of the things you saw when you were in space most pertinent to our conversation today was the International Space Station.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cady Coleman</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I did, and I lived up there for almost six months. I really loved it up there. But that first sight, I mean, I was so used to doing spacewalking practice in our giant swimming pool where it&#8217;s like 40 feet deep, the size of a football field. And then you arrive at this pristine city in space. It was like being in Wonderland. Suni had two missions to the space station already, this is her third. And Butch had one shuttle and then one station, and now he&#8217;s up there. So they knew what they were coming to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GhJ6CTDEoM&amp;themeRefresh=1">magical place</a>. And I think what&#8217;s really meaningful is knowing that everything that you do up there matters. It gets us one step closer to going back to the moon and going to Mars. And I don&#8217;t just say that like it&#8217;s a trendy thing to say, because I just think it&#8217;s true.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you know these two astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cady Coleman</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do. We all know each other. It&#8217;s like one big family. I arrived in 1992, Suni and Butch just a little bit later than that. I&#8217;m a little closer to Suni than I am to Butch, just because we have a little more in common. But I&#8217;ve done a lot of training with Butch in the T-38 airplanes that we fly to learn things. He and Suni are both test pilots, and I am from the Air Force, but a chemist from the Air Force. So I had a lot to learn from each of them in terms of aviation. And Suni just has this really great attitude. Whether it&#8217;s organizing a neighborhood event or something in the astronaut office or being in this kind of situation, Suni has this very levelheaded but joyful way of living that is inspirational to me as a friend.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And so when you heard that they weren&#8217;t going to come back as early as hoped, what went through your head first?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cady Coleman</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Certainly some jealousy …</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jealousy!&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cady Coleman</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes!</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amazing.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cady Coleman</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I would imagine many of us are. And at the same time, it&#8217;s certainly their time to fly again. They&#8217;ve been very patient. So it&#8217;s not like, “Oh, this could be mine.” It&#8217;s more just a little bit wistful because I really loved working up there and I think it&#8217;s a great opportunity. But I also love watching folks that I know are just really invested and wonderful working up there. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I tell people this is NASA at its very best. It is taking the time to collect test data just like they should, even though the media keeps emphasizing that the two people are stranded, when this is just the way learning more about space and your capabilities works.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You have mentioned that there&#8217;s a lot to do up there, whereas I imagine most people think they&#8217;re probably just losing their minds. What are they doing up there?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cady Coleman</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There&#8217;s a whole list of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/science-takes-time-even-in-a-lab-moving-17500-miles-per-hour/">experiments</a> and maintenance that has to be done. When we go up to space, we take away a huge variable, which is that we are basically weightless, not perfectly, but as close as you need to get to learn a lot. You get to measure things that are hard to measure on the earth. And we learn about things like combustion and about groundwater and erosion. We learn how plants grow, don&#8217;t grow. If we&#8217;re going to grow corn on Mars, we probably don&#8217;t need corn stalks because they&#8217;re not going to have to hold themselves up very much. So it&#8217;s all these different ways of thinking scientifically. It&#8217;s another laboratory. It&#8217;s almost like a brand-new microscope, a different way to look at things.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What do Butch and Suni need to do while they&#8217;re up there to make sure being in a near-zero gravity situation doesn&#8217;t take a toll on their bodies?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cady Coleman</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/missions/station/iss-research/astronaut-exercise/">Exercise</a> is the biggest answer that we&#8217;ve seen. I mean, without exercise, without some kind of countermeasure, astronauts were losing about a percent and a half of their bone mass every month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What a woman who&#8217;s 70 years old and has osteoporosis loses in a year, I would lose in a month if I did nothing. It&#8217;s a big deal. We looked at different drugs and different kinds of exercise and exercise machines. They spend about two hours a day exercising. And about half of that is aerobic on a treadmill or a bike, keeping their hearts in shape. And about half of that is lifting weights. And we&#8217;re finding that people are coming back with most of their <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/esdmd/hhp/bone-and-mineral-evaluation-and-analysis/">bone mass</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How does an astronaut on the ISS find time to, I don&#8217;t know, say, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeC4nqBB5BM">duet with Ian Anderson from Jethro Tull</a>?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Cady Coleman</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, in my case, I think most of the creative things that I did up there were probably done during time I was supposed to be sleeping.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are a small part of a really big place, and we belong up there. And the feeling I had when I came home was just that I knew I&#8217;d go to space. I didn&#8217;t understand that once I got there, I&#8217;d actually feel just as close to Earth. And so it turns out that home is bigger than we thought.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Coverage of the wars in Ukraine and Gaza is mostly dominated by talk of weapons.

But for all the attention devoted to modern weapons and munitions, both conflicts are proving that modern war still comes down to people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Ukraine, battlefield deaths on both sides were estimated to number more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/18/ukraine-russia-war-battlefield-deaths-rise">200,000</a> by the fall of 2023. Though US weapons and munitions have been critical to Kyiv’s war effort, it was territorial militias and hastily trained citizen-soldiers who <a href="https://www.rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/ukraines-territorial-defence-forces-war-so-far-and-future-prospects">helped save Ukraine</a> from total conquest in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, it was a <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/what-does-russias-partial-mobilization-mean">partial mobilization</a> of more than 300,000 troops that <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/russia-rebound-moscow-recovered-military-setbacks">stabilized Russia’s lines</a> and prevented a potential collapse in late 2022. Today, the war has settled into an attritional slugfest, with both sides desperate to keep the flow of new recruits going, to the point where ranks have opened to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-war-russia-compulsory-military-service-conscription-draft-age/">older men</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/08/world/europe/ukraine-war-army-women.html">women</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-prisoners.html">convicts</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The situation is much the same in the Middle East. On October 7, Israel’s <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/26/israel-hamas-gaza-military-idf-technology-surveillance-fence-strategy-ground-war/">heavily automated</a> Gaza perimeter was breached by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67480680">well-trained but low-tech</a> Hamas terrorists. The attack was eventually repulsed by conscript soldiers and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israel-hamas-attack-kibbutz-survived-4057fb1f">armed volunteers</a> — even in the “<a href="https://www.cfr.org/book/start-nation">start-up nation</a>” that prides itself on its technological prowess, security depends first and foremost on people. Similar to the Russian mobilization before the invasion of Ukraine, the immediate <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/10/israel-military-draft-reservists/">calling up of 360,000 reservists</a> enabled Israel to conduct its campaign against Hamas and deter other non-state foes in the West Bank and Lebanon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">America did away with the draft 51 years ago, waging its many wars and interventions since with the All-Volunteer Force (AVF). But “all-volunteer” is a misnomer. Americans aren’t lining up to serve, and the AVF is really an all-recruited force. Its previous <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-12/joining-the-military-doesn-t-appeal-to-enough-young-americans#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20currently%20has%201.3,overall%20%E2%80%9Cend%20strength%E2%80%9D%20goal.">annual recruitment of about 150,000</a> mostly young Americans, who are individually located, pitched, and incentivized to serve, comes at considerable <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2021/09/accounting-for-the-costs-of-military-personnel/">effort and expense</a>.<br><br>The United States got through two foreign wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with the AVF — though neither war was a victory. A war with Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea would be an entirely different proposition, with the possibility of more <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/first-battle-next-war-wargaming-chinese-invasion-taiwan">casualties</a> in a few weeks than the United States suffered in the entire Global War on Terrorism. But as crises overseas multiply, the immediate existential threat to the AVF, and ultimately to US security, is at home: there aren’t enough Americans willing and able to fill the military’s ranks.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Not enough soldiers</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Three of America’s four major military services <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2023/10/13/big-bonuses-relaxed-policies-new-slogan-none-of-it-saved-military-recruiting-crisis-2023.html">failed to recruit</a> enough servicemembers in 2023. The Army has failed to meet <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/4236203-army-revamps-recruiting-in-face-of-enlistment-shortfalls/#:~:text=The%20service%20has%20failed%20to,in%202021%20to%20around%20452%2C000.">its manpower goals</a> for the last two years and missed its 2023 target by 10,000 soldiers, a 20 percent shortfall. Today, the <a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/FY2025/FY2025_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf#page=140">active-duty Army</a> stands at 445,000 soldiers, 41,000 fewer <a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2021/fy2021_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf#page=117">than in 2021</a> and the smallest it has been since 1940.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Navy and <a href="https://www.stripes.com/branches/air_force/2023-09-13/air-force-recruiting-shortfall-11367725.html">Air Force</a> missed their recruiting goals too, the Navy failing <a href="https://news.usni.org/2023/10/11/navy-misses-all-recruiting-goals-in-fy-2023-raises-goals-for-fy-2024">across the board</a>. The Marine Corps was the only service to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/17/us/marines-army-recruits.html">achieve its targets</a> (not counting the tiny Space Force). But the Marines’ success is partially attributable to significant <a href="https://news.usni.org/2021/03/01/berger-reaffirms-commitment-to-force-design-2030-overhaul-in-memo-to-new-secdef">force structure cuts</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.marines.mil/Portals/1/Docs/Force_Design_2030_Annual_Update_June_2023.pdf">Force Design 2030</a> overhaul. As a result, Marine recruiters have nearly 19,000 fewer <a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/FY2025/FY2025_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf#page=140">active duty and selected reserve slots</a> to fill today than <a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2021/fy2021_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf#page=117">they did as recently as 2020</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A decrease in the size of the active force might be less worrying if a large reserve pool could be mobilized in the event of a major war or national emergency. But recruiting challenges have impacted the reserve components even more severely than the active duty force. The <a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/FY2025/FY2025_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf#page=140">National Guard and Reserves</a> have been <a href="https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2021/fy2021_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf#page=117">shrinking since 2020</a>. Last year, the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve <a href="https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-air-force/2023/09/14/entire-air-force-to-miss-recruiting-goal-the-first-failure-since-1999/">each missed</a> their recruiting targets by 30 percent. The Army Reserve <a href="https://www.ngaus.org/newsroom/recruiting-continues-be-challenging">had just 9,319 enlistees</a> after aiming to recruit 14,650 new soldiers. Numbers for the Navy Reserve were just as bad — the service missed its enlisted and officer targets by <a href="https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2023/10/10/navy-misses-active-duty-reserve-recruiting-goals-for-2023/">35 and 40 percent</a>, respectively.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Should a true national security emergency arise, America lacks the ability to mobilize as Israel and Russia have done. The <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/10144">Individual Ready Reserve</a> (IRR) — comprising former active duty or selected reserve personnel who could be reactivated by the Secretary of Defense during wartime or a national emergency — is designed to act as a bridge from the AVF to a revived draft. Almost forgotten even by servicemembers, the IRR earned brief notoriety when some servicemembers <a href="https://time.com/archive/6738930/welcome-back-to-the-front-soldier/">were “stop-lossed”</a> during the Iraq War — pulled from the IRR and returned to active duty involuntarily, usually to deploy again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, there are just over <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10540#page=2">264,000 servicemembers in the entire IRR</a>. The Army’s IRR pool has shrunk from <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/fpcd-83-12.pdf#page=10">700,000 in 1973</a> to <a href="https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3233&amp;context=parameters#page=7">76,000 in 2023</a>. Forget building new units in wartime: the IRR is now incapable of even providing sufficient casualty replacements for losses from the first battles of a high-intensity war.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if more Americans could be encouraged to sign up, they may not be able to serve. Before Covid, fewer than 3 in 10 Americans in the prime recruiting demographic — ages 17 to 24 — were eligible to serve in uniform. Those numbers have <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/military-recruitment-pentagon-study-youth/">shrunk further</a> since the pandemic began. Only <a href="https://prod-media.asvabprogram.com/CEP_PDF_Contents/Qualified_Military_Available.pdf">23 percent of young Americans</a> are qualified to enlist without a waiver, based on the most recent data. Endemic <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/265476/military_health_experts_highlight_need_for_u_s_youth_to_maintain_healthy_weight">youth obesity</a>, record levels of <a href="https://sc.edu/uofsc/posts/2023/03/military_readiness_public_health.php">physical unfitness</a>, mental health issues <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/teens-mental-health-suffered-during-covid-19-pandemic-cdc-study-finds-11648763344">exacerbated by the Covid pandemic</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/us/marijuana-drugs-federal-jobs.html">drug use</a> have rendered the vast majority of young Americans ineligible for military service. Scores on the ASVAB — the military’s standardized exam for recruits, which tests aptitude for service — <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/258809/transcript_army_recruiting_media_round_table_july_26_2022">plummeted during the pandemic</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The introduction of a <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2023/04/10/the-genesis-of-todays-recruiting-crisis/">new military health system</a> in 2022, MHS Genesis, has also hamstrung recruiting. Recruits used to be able to omit mention of disqualifying factors like years-old sports injuries, the use of an inhaler, or mental health counseling — often after some coaching from recruiters. But Genesis combs through civilian health records and automatically flags anything that runs afoul of the military’s <a href="https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/613003_vol1.PDF?ver=7fhqacc0jGX_R9_1iexudA%3D%3D">medical standards</a>. While Genesis has undoubtedly hurt recruiters’ ability to meet their quotas, it has done so by finally holding the AVF to its own enlistment standards.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">An Army of none?</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even among those who actually remain eligible to serve, far fewer have any apparent desire to do so. Fewer than <a href="https://docs.opa.mil/opa.mil-production1/reports/futures_surveys/YP54Fall2022PUBLICRELEASEPropensityUpdate_20230713_v1.pdf#page=3">10 percent of Americans</a> aged 16 to 21 say they would seriously consider signing up, according to a 2022 poll from the Pentagon’s Office of People Analytics. Those interested in serving are largely motivated by material factors. Respondents cited pay, college tuition aid, travel opportunities, health benefits, and acquiring career skills as the <a href="https://docs.opa.mil/opa.mil-production1/reports/futures_surveys/YP54Fall2022PUBLICRELEASEPropensityUpdate_20230713_v1.pdf#page=14">top five reasons</a> for considering military service. Only 24 percent said they would join the military out of a sense of pride or honor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the US population has increased by <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/popchange-data-text.html">more than 50 percent</a> since the end of the draft, the AVF has come to rely on a smaller and smaller share of the nation. In the all-recruited force, it is military families that have inexorably become the primary providers of new recruits. Nearly 80 percent of recent Army enlistees have a veteran in their family — for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/us/military-enlistment.html">almost 30 percent</a>, it’s a parent. In the half-century since the AVF’s birth, the US military has become a family business.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This entrenchment of a “warrior caste” presents a <a href="https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/hero/documents/CNASReport-WarriorCast-Final.pdf">long-term danger to democracy</a>: a citizenry disconnected from its military can become indifferent to the missions it performs. Civilian oversight and accountability suffer when the military is insulated from public scrutiny and understanding. The percentage of veterans in Congress has <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/12/07/new-congress-will-have-a-few-more-veterans-but-their-share-of-lawmakers-is-still-near-a-record-low/">declined precipitously</a> in the 50 years of the AVF’s existence. But the immediate danger is more concrete. Should the majority of military families decide the nation is unworthy of their children’s service, as may <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/military-recruiting-crisis-veterans-dont-want-their-children-to-join-510e1a25">already be happening</a>, the AVF will become unsustainable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The worst of the recruiting crisis is still to come. American birth rates plummeted after the 2008 financial crisis: a “baby bust” saw almost <a href="https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1230&amp;context=carsey#:~:text=Nearly%202.3%20million%20fewer%20babies,in%20nearly%20500%2C000%20fewer%20births.">2.3 million fewer</a> children born between 2008 and 2013 than had been projected before the crisis. The number of American 18-year-olds is <a href="https://www.aei.org/op-eds/the-demographic-and-fiscal-time-bombs-ticking-inside-the-pentagon%EF%BF%BC/">set to peak in 2025</a> at 9.4 million, before dropping to about 8 million by 2029. With <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/us-births-are-down-again-after-the-covid-baby-bust-and-rebound/">another baby bust</a> during the Covid pandemic, the following generation will likely be even smaller.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Potential solutions to the recruiting crisis depend on one’s diagnosis: in the language of the marketplace, is the AVF a bad product or just badly pitched?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those who argue that the recruiting crisis is a marketing failure point to young Americans’ <a href="https://www.military.com/veteran-jobs/army-could-not-effectively-address-gen-zs-misconceptions-about-army-life-2022.html">general ignorance</a> of basic facts of military life. <a href="https://www.military.com/veteran-jobs/army-could-not-effectively-address-gen-zs-misconceptions-about-army-life-2022.html">Forty-nine percent of Gen Zers</a> in a 2022 Army-commissioned survey thought that American soldiers received no personal time off and no vacation days. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/afghanistan-politics-military-and-defense-race-ethnicity-6548adcb0fee590f3427771d1e1eeea7">Army surveys</a> of Americans aged 16 to 28 conducted in 2022 revealed that the top two reasons this cohort wouldn’t consider serving were fear of death and concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The reality is that <a href="https://prologue.blogs.archives.gov/2022/03/10/contact-brawls-and-chambering-the-combat-action-ribbon/">less than 15 percent</a> of enlisted military personnel are assigned a combat role, and far fewer ever find themselves in a firefight. Despite the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, fewer American servicemembers are facing potential combat missions now than at any time <a href="https://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/costs/human/veterans">since 9/11</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A record dented by two decades of defeat has undermined the US military’s self-anointed status as the “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/05/19/a-proclamation-on-armed-forces-day-2023/">finest fighting force</a> the world has ever known,” leading to a significant <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/509189/confidence-military-lowest-two-decades.aspx">decline in public trust</a>. Though some might call the US military “America’s team,” it hasn’t <a href="https://history.army.mil/html/bookshelves/resmat/desert-storm/index.html#overview">won a game</a> since Desert Storm, before most of its current members were born. A 2019 Pew Research Center survey found that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/07/10/majorities-of-u-s-veterans-public-say-the-wars-in-iraq-and-afghanistan-were-not-worth-fighting/#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20majorities%20of%20both%20veterans,not%20serve%20in%20these%20wars.">58 and 64 percent</a> of veterans of Afghanistan and Iraq, respectively, say those conflicts were not worth fighting. A political horseshoe effect has helped cement this: both <a href="https://www.socialistalternative.org/no-to-bushs-war-on-iraq/liberal-democrats-propose-reinstating-the-draft-hell-no-we-wont-go/">leftists</a> and <a href="https://americanmind.org/salvo/become-undraftable/">right-wingers</a> publicly advocate for refusing to fight what they call unnecessary, unwinnable wars, with an especially sharp <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/01/10/army-sees-sharp-decline-white-recruits.html">decline</a> in enlistments by white men and women. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Policymakers’ refusal to cut missions and offload defense burdens to wealthy allies greatly exacerbates the strain on the All-Volunteer Force. Though the United States is not at war, its military remains highly active, with constant deployments to Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Some branches and military communities, like armor, air defense, and aircraft carriers, <a href="https://www.defensepriorities.org/explainers/global-posture-review-2021-an-opportunity-for-realism-and-realignment/">struggle to maintain</a> even a 2-1 ratio of “dwell to deploy” (the Pentagon’s desired ratio is <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2021/09/16/13-deployment-to-dwell-ratio-to-be-standardized-under-dod-policy-starting-in-nov/">three years at home</a> for every year overseas). This unsustainable pace burns out soldiers, erodes morale, and helps fuel an <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2024/03/11/broken-track-suicides-suffering-in-armys-exhausted-armor-community/">epidemic of military suicides</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some more mundane elements of the military lifestyle are also contributing to rising disillusion within the warrior caste. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/usa-military/">Poor on-base housing</a>, potential <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/04/politics/military-food-insecurity/index.html">food insecurity</a>, and a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WB/mib/WB-MilSpouse-factsheet.pdf">high spousal unemployment rate</a> are unappealing for young Americans looking to start their careers and families. Relocation for servicemembers, which occurs <a href="https://www.mfan.org/topic/moving-permanent-change-of-station/effects-of-moving-on-military-families/">every 2.5 years</a> on average, puts additional stress on families and runs counter to the <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2023/03/the-sinking-ship-of-theseus-adapting-the-u-s-military-to-the-modern-family/">desire for stability</a> people generally gain as they age. And the strong <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/04/job-market-is-strong-but-more-competitive-for-applicants.html">post-Covid labor market</a> has limited the economic appeal of military employment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dissatisfaction with the product isn’t just limited to military families. Gen Z, which already constitutes <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24177791/2022-demographics-report.pdf#page=35">about 40 percent</a> of military personnel, views serving in the armed forces through a different lens than the millennials who came before them (and who made up the majority of the fighting force in Iraq and Afghanistan). This “<a href="https://warontherocks.com/2018/03/how-the-network-generation-is-changing-the-millennial-military/">network generation</a>” is immersed in the <a href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/how-gen-z-consumes-media-5-charts">digital world</a>, distrustful of <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/510395/gen-voices-lackluster-trust-major-institutions.aspx">institutional authority</a>, and often viewed as <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/gen-z-mental-health-rising-therapy-industry-shortage-1831849">psychologically fragile</a>. However you view Gen Z, accommodating them is a tall order for a military&nbsp;that prioritizes hierarchy, physical and mental fortitude, and self-sacrifice.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The “D” word</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether the recruiting crisis is primarily a problem of product or pitch, one thing should be increasingly clear: going back to the <a href="https://defense360.csis.org/bad-idea-relying-on-the-same-old-solutions-to-meet-the-military-recruitment-challenge/">standard AVF recruiting playbook</a> — signing bonuses, waivers for substandard fitness or education, new slogans, and expensive ad campaigns — is unlikely to solve the problem.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To attract civilians in highly specialized and increasingly vital fields like cyber operations, <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2018/01/blue-hair-gray-zone/">some analysts have proposed</a> that the US military relax its standards to acquire more technically skilled recruits. But such a move <a href="https://warontherocks.com/2018/01/blue-haired-soldiers-just-say-no/">risks undermining</a> the universal standards that undergird the military’s egalitarianism and common culture — critical advantages in the crucible of combat. And despite the drones and the tech, modern war still requires soldiers who can endure the physical demands of high-intensity combat. As seen in Ukraine, the deployment of mobile surveillance systems <a href="https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/military-review/Archives/English/Online-Exclusive/2023/The-More-Things-Change/Bolton-AWC-Ukraine-Observations-UA.pdf#page=9">in combination with</a> mass precision strikes require <a href="https://static.rusi.org/359-SR-Ukraine-Preliminary-Lessons-Feb-July-2022-web-final.pdf#page=64">constant battlefield mobility</a> merely to survive. Combat is still a young man’s game.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what can be done? The Army has taken a dramatic step toward increasing its recruiting pool by standing up the Future Soldier Preparatory Course, a remedial program for motivated recruits who nonetheless fail to meet initial entry standards. Future Soldier Prep will take in nearly <a href="https://www.armytimes.com/news/your-army/2024/08/04/as-recruiting-rebounds-army-to-expand-basic-training-rebuild-for-war/">20,000 recruits this year</a>, which may enable the Army to make its lower recruiting mission. But the long-term potential and performance of soldiers who require that much additional help just to make initial standards is unknown.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A longer-term solution could involve minimizing the friction of moving between civilian life, reserve service, and active duty service — a concept known as “permeability.” Flanked by oceans and friendly neighbors, America has the luxury of time for mobilizing its armed forces, even in an age of intercontinental missiles. Such efforts could ensure both broader access to talented potential servicemen and women who know they’ll be able to better balance civilian and military life, and a far better understanding of and appreciation for military service.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But breaking down the existing barriers to both entering and leaving service strikes at the heart of the US military’s view of itself as a profession, not a part-time job. Even limited moves toward <a href="https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/features/2015/0315_force-of-the-future/Fact-Sheet-The-Next-Two-Links-to-the-Force-of-the-Future.pdf">lateral entry</a> — allowing civilians in specialist fields like cyber operations to enter the military at a mid-career level — for <a href="https://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/your-marine-corps/2023/03/06/first-lateral-entrants-could-join-the-marine-corps-within-months/">exceptional individuals</a> have yet to be embraced by the services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps a serious national security threat will motivate more Americans to join the military. But even that might not be enough: the massive militaries that fought existential conflicts like the <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA326566.pdf">American Civil War</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/draft-and-wwii#:~:text=The%20Draft%20and%20WWII&amp;text=Once%20the%20U.S.%20entered%20WWII,been%20inducted%20in%20the%20military.">World War II</a> were filled not merely with volunteers, but millions of conscripts. Even Ukraine, currently in a fight for national survival, is <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/25711074-5e1a-494a-9d7c-ccb535f671d5">having trouble</a> enlisting sufficient soldiers. Having been burned by massive threat inflation over terrorism in the post-9/11 era, Americans may be understandably skeptical of the gravity of the Russian or Chinese threat to the United States.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, there is the “D” word: the draft. There has been no serious attempt to restore American military conscription since compulsory military service ended in 1973. But several key American allies, including <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2022/12/falqs-the-conscription-system-of-south-korea/">South Korea</a> and the new NATO members <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/04/world/europe/finland-military-nato-russia-ukraine.html">Finland</a> and <a href="https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2017/03/02/sweden-reintroduces-military-draft-this-time-including-women/">Sweden</a>, still man their militaries with partial or universal conscription. While America is unlikely to ever again need the <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers">12 million servicemen and women</a> it had in 1945, clearly failing recruiting efforts may at least prompt a reexamination of compulsory service.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Absent a draft or major structural reform to AVF recruiting and retention, the US military will struggle not to shrink. A shrinking force will propel a vicious cycle, as a smaller military carries the same load of overseas deployments. A worsening <a href="https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2020/02/14/why_we_should_grow_the_active_duty_army_115042.html">deployment-to-dwell</a> ratio will hurt retention, as the strain on family life of lengthy deployments becomes intolerable. Lower retention will then necessitate higher recruiting goals, even as exiting troops would serve as walking negative advertisements for American military life.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The recruiting crisis is a greater national security threat to the United States than the wars that currently dominate the headlines. If there is one lesson America’s leaders should take from the conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, it is that <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/355547/soldiers-shortage-demographics-population-conscription">troop mobilization and depth</a> are still essential for fighting wars. As both Israel and Ukraine have learned, no amount of high-tech wizardry has changed this enduring reality of warfare. Should the United States fail to fix its military recruiting, it will risk losing a great power war — with enormous consequences for all Americans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While true policy proposals came at a trickle over the course of four nights, what flowed plentifully were <em>vibes</em> — a palpable exhilaration about the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, that had largely evaded the party and voters in the months (and maybe years) before President Joe Biden <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/36547721.116633/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8zNjE4MjcvYmlkZW4tZHJvcHMtb3V0LTIwMjQta2FtYWxhLWNvbnZlbnRpb24_dWVpZD0xYjc3MjIzNzdmMDc1YzAxMGFmZjczYzlhZWUxZjAwMw/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5Bb8e9c72a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped out of the race</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Michelle Obama <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/36547721.116633/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS8yMDI0LWVsZWN0aW9ucy8zNjc4OTkvbWljaGVsbGUtb2JhbWEtZG5jLWNvbnZlbnRpb24tc3BlZWNoLTIwMjQtaG9wZT91ZWlkPTFiNzcyMjM3N2YwNzVjMDEwYWZmNzNjOWFlZTFmMDAz/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B5ac95f9b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described the Democrats’ vibe shift best</a> when she noted: “Something wonderfully magical is in the air, isn’t it? … We’re feeling it here in this arena, but it’s spreading all across this country we love. A familiar feeling that’s been buried too deep for far too long.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what role does this kind of magic have to play in a highly consequential US election? Vibes, after all, are not votes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Can Harris turn the current burst of excitement into a persuasive argument for undecided and swing-state voters to cast their ballots for her? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, Vox’s senior political reporter Christian Paz, who covers the Democratic Party, joins me to help make sense of the vibes candidacy, how it could translate at the polls, and what we might be missing in the haze of the excitement. Our interview has been condensed and lightly edited.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Lavanya Ramanathan</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, <em>is</em> there really a vibe shift happening among Democrats right now? It sure seems like it.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Christian Paz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah, and there are a few ways to quantify that. The first is approval ratings or <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/36547721.116633/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcm9qZWN0cy5maXZldGhpcnR5ZWlnaHQuY29tL3BvbGxzL2Zhdm9yYWJpbGl0eS9rYW1hbGEtaGFycmlzLz91ZWlkPTFiNzcyMjM3N2YwNzVjMDEwYWZmNzNjOWFlZTFmMDAz/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5Bf864f591" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorability ratings</a> for Kamala Harris. One of the key things we’ve seen is a pretty sharp reversal in her favorability ratings. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They’ve pretty much shot up as people have gotten to know her, as they figure out who she is and what she did as vice president, and just see more of her, because we really did not see a lot of her through her vice presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Gallup’s <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/36547721.116633/aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdhbGx1cC5jb20vcG9sbC82NDkxMjcvZGVtb2NyYXRzLWdpdmUtaGFycmlzLW5lYXJseS11bmFuaW1vdXMtcG9zaXRpdmUtcmF0aW5ncy5hc3B4P3VlaWQ9MWI3NzIyMzc3ZjA3NWMwMTBhZmY3M2M5YWVlMWYwMDM/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5Bdd82f82b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent polling</a>, she has a 93 percent favorable opinion rating from Democrats, up from 77 percent in June. That’s a pretty definable vibe shift in her favor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other way to measure vibe is <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/36547721.116633/aHR0cHM6Ly94LmNvbS9Gb3JlY2FzdGVyRW50ZW4vc3RhdHVzLzE4MTc5MTg0NjA5OTI5MzQzMjA_dWVpZD0xYjc3MjIzNzdmMDc1YzAxMGFmZjczYzlhZWUxZjAwMw/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5Bd3bd19f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motivation to vote</a>, and that has also changed. Now it’s Democrats who are outpacing Republicans in terms of motivation to vote. In the past, Republicans had a pretty significant lead.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another factor is anecdotal evidence — the fact that there’s such a saturation of coverage of her, whether that’s a lot of positive coverage in media, the <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/36547721.116633/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9jdWx0dXJlLzM2MjMwMC9rYW1hbGEtaGFycmlzLW1lbWUtYnJhdC1zdW1tZXI_dWVpZD0xYjc3MjIzNzdmMDc1YzAxMGFmZjczYzlhZWUxZjAwMw/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5Bd29a023a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memes</a>, the jokes about brat summer, coconut trees, or coconut-pilling, all of which has generated excitement among younger people. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Lavanya Ramanathan</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why are people feeling this in such a pronounced way now? We had Michelle Obama hinting that the last time we saw this energy was for Barack Obama.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Christian Paz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the reason people are so optimistic about Harris is that they see her as a change candidate, even though she’s technically an incumbent. She’s part of the administration. People are willing to forgive some of her association with Biden and look past some of the more unpopular parts of the Biden presidency and not blame her for that and give her credit for the more popular aspects.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People do want to feel that there’s a difference in the air, and that’s why they’re harking back to the closest thing to that: 2008. There are similarities there. It’s another Black candidate; it’s a female presidential candidate, which reminds us of 2016. So what we’ve got brewing together, I think of it almost like a tea, with notes you remember from the past, repackaged for the post-Trump era.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if you’re looking beyond the vibes, Harris is up in a few polls in North Carolina, looking to expand the map to Florida, and being serious about Arizona, which are some of the same things we were hearing during the Obama campaign, so it’s a fair comparison to make. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Lavanya Ramanathan</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One comparison we cannot make to Obama is that he had months longer to campaign. People quit their jobs to join the campaign and knock on doors. There weren’t just vibes, there was on-the-ground work. I don’t know that Harris has that time to reach out to voters on that level. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What should people understand about whether vibes will be enough to translate to votes?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Christian Paz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah, just like we’re cautious of polls, we should be cautious of vibes. They’re vibes. They’re amorphous. They’re temporary. I think that’s why it’s important to remember we are in a bit of a bubble.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s an excellent point how compacted and compressed this timeline is. We haven’t had a negative Harris news cycle. The last month has been nonstop positive coverage of Harris, and we should be ready to see a change in that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also been a lot of noise from <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/36547721.116633/aHR0cHM6Ly9wcm9qZWN0cy5maXZldGhpcnR5ZWlnaHQuY29tL3BvbGxzL3ByZXNpZGVudC1nZW5lcmFsLzIwMjQvbmF0aW9uYWwvP3VlaWQ9MWI3NzIyMzc3ZjA3NWMwMTBhZmY3M2M5YWVlMWYwMDM/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B545a0a44" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the polls</a>, but I’ve heard from a lot of pollsters that there is now a reversal of what we saw with Trump voters. They call it a response bias, where you have a specific kind of voter who wants to be heard and is more likely to be represented in the polling and paint a misleading picture. That used to boost Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As far as how this translates into votes and reality, after we have those caveats, it’s important to remember that Harris is inheriting a lot of the Biden campaign infrastructure. They have a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/22/us/elections/kamala-harris-donors.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/08/22/us/elections/kamala-harris-donors.html">bunch of</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/25/nx-s1-5089138/kamala-harris-fundraising-dnc" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/25/nx-s1-5089138/kamala-harris-fundraising-dnc">money</a>. And honestly, there’s been some political science research that shows that the most effective way to reach out to a traditional voter is TV advertising and online advertising, which is why it’s so important that they have so much money to spend.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The next best way is to get out and talk to people, and luckily, again, the Biden team has a pretty good infrastructure in place already. They have a bunch more campaign offices than the Trump campaign does, they have them set up in various states, and they have been hiring.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’ll see how much door-knocking we see. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, there were some questions about whether there would be enough Biden volunteers who wanted to campaign for him. In that sense, the vibes do matter: We’ve seen a <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/36547721.116633/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGJzLm9yZy9uZXdzaG91ci9wb2xpdGljcy9pbi1maXJzdC13ZWVrLW9mLWNhbXBhaWduaW5nLWhhcnJpcy1yYWlzZWQtMjAwbS1hbmQtc2lnbmVkLXVwLTE3MDAwMC12b2x1bnRlZXJzP3VlaWQ9MWI3NzIyMzc3ZjA3NWMwMTBhZmY3M2M5YWVlMWYwMDM/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B2c034e67" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rush</a> of <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/36547721.116633/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjbmV3cy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvMjAyNC1lbGVjdGlvbi9oYXJyaXMtY2FtcGFpZ24tdHJhbnNmb3JtaW5nLWJpZy1jcm93ZHMtdm9sdW50ZWVycy1ncm91bmQta2V5LXN3aW5nLXN0LXJjbmExNjYzMjk_dWVpZD0xYjc3MjIzNzdmMDc1YzAxMGFmZjczYzlhZWUxZjAwMw/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B167b9a54" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">volunteers</a> sign up to help Democrats recently. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s another way to measure vibe shift: In a qualitative sense, Harris is making it easier for your volunteers to make the pitch for the candidate. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Lavanya Ramanathan</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m really curious. What does all this discussion of positive energy and vibes obscure about this election?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Christian Paz</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was a lot of behind-the-scenes tension and dissension over the uncommitted delegates, over protests regarding Gaza. We didn’t see a lot of that being discussed at the convention. [Harris ultimately addressed the conflict and her position in&nbsp;<a href="https://link.vox.com/click/36547721.116633/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy8zNjg0NjIva2FtYWxhLWhhcnJpcy1pc3JhZWwtcGFsZXN0aW5lLWdhemEtZG5jLXNwZWVjaD91ZWlkPTFiNzcyMjM3N2YwNzVjMDEwYWZmNzNjOWFlZTFmMDAz/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B3ec03442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">her closing remarks</a>.]</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other thing is there’s still a lot of dissatisfaction on the economy and inflation. We didn’t hear a lot about that at the DNC. Harris is trying to be proactive on these issues but doesn’t necessarily know the best way to speak about them. How much do you want to speak about inflation and remind people you’re part of this administration? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also still a chance for the economy to take a negative turn in the coming months, and that would be bad for Harris. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The third thing the vibes are obscuring right now is, yes, it’s still a really close race. People are pointing out that Trump is still an average polling error away from winning, and winning pretty big.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a lot that can still affect how the party’s liberals are thinking and turning out, a lot that can affect how more moderate and swing-state voters are really thinking.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s still really, really close, and that’s something folks have to remember.&nbsp;<br><br><em>This story&nbsp;originally appeared&nbsp;in&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Today, Explained</a></em></strong><em>, Vox’s flagship daily newsletter.&nbsp;</em><strong><em><a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/today-explained-newsletter-signup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign up here for future editions</a></em></strong><em>.</em><br></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An event as seismic as <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/351720/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-bennifer-timeline-divorce-rumors">Bennifer 2.0</a> could only end in a PR showdown. After months of breakup rumors, <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/02/lifestyle/inside-ben-afflecks-new-20m-la-mansion-amid-jennifer-lopez-split-rumors/">real-estate news</a>, and a canceled tour, Jennifer Lopez finally <a href="https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-divorce-8649120">filed for divorce</a> from her husband Ben Affleck on August 20, citing “irreconcilable differences.” That date also marks the second anniversary of their lavish wedding ceremony in Georgia. It seems like this breakup isn’t just a sad affair but a bitter one, too. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their antics in the press say as much. If you pay attention to how celebrities use the tabloid press and their own lore to shape public opinion, a couple of narratives are forming. There are already <a href="https://people.com/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-split-what-went-wrong-exclusive-8701617">numerous reports</a> from unnamed sources alleging <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/21/entertainment/ben-affleck-showed-no-interest-in-fixing-jennifer-lopez-marriage/#:~:text=Jennifer%20Lopez%20is%20ready%20to,Now%E2%80%9D%20star%20pulled%20the%20plug.">Affleck’s cold behavior</a> toward Lopez, acting <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-only-talk-through-lawyers/">distant</a> toward her while they supposedly tried to work through their issues. Meanwhile, Affleck has remained mostly quiet, with sources claiming he wants a more “civilized” divorce. Given the public’s perception of Lopez as the more attention-seeking partner in their marriage, this is most likely a PR strategy of its own.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From a publicity angle, it looks like Lopez has more to lose. For a singer whose image violently swings between Hollywood icon and celebrity laughingstock, divorcing the so-called love of her life — also, the subject of her <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24075110/jennifer-lopez-movie-this-is-me-now-love-story-review">latest musical era,</a> which turned into an epic failure — puts her in a vulnerable position yet again. We haven’t even gotten to the inevitable battle over money, considering the former couple wed reportedly without a prenuptial agreement. If the <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29833912/jennifer-lopez-net-worth/#">estimates</a> <a href="https://pagesix.com/entertainment/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-net-worth/">tossed around</a> for their net worths are true — and if you can’t trust CelebrityNetWorth.com, who can you trust? — Lopez has significantly more to lose than Affleck. She’s also forgoing legal representation, which seems like a worse decision than a self-funded $20 million movie. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Like most celebrity divorces, mudslinging and tabloid leaks are baked into the process. Still, for two seasoned A-listers who have already experienced personal and professional challenges in the limelight, another media circus seems like a waste of energy. Beyond maybe entertaining the public, there aren’t any new stakes. The Bennifer drama forces us to ask the question: Does anyone win in a celebrity divorce?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What are Affleck and Lopez saying about each other?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, neither party has commented directly on the divorce (although a rep for Affleck <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2024/08/28/ben-affleck-kick-kennedy-rfk-daughter-dating-rumor/74977777007/">shut down rumors</a> that he was dating RFK Jr.’s daughter Kick Kennedy). Instead, it appears that they’re letting anonymously sourced reports and photographed outings create narratives for them. Most of the “sources” seem to be working on Lopez’s behalf, which isn’t a surprise given that she initiated the divorce and seems, well, <a href="https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-upset-disappointed-ben-affleck-exclusive-source-8703655">frustrated</a>. It’s also notable that several of these exclusives are coming from People, a tabloid with a reputation for working directly with celebrities and their publicists. Meanwhile, Affleck is seemingly trying to avoid looking like the “most divorced man,” a title he earned after his split with Jennifer Garner in 2015. Days after Lopez’s divorce filing, he was photographed picking up a Jack in the Box delivery at his new LA home, a throwback to his days picking up Dunkin’ Donuts during the pandemic where his relatable dad persona really took shape.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These accounts suggest that Lopez was neglected by Affleck in the marriage and tried her best to make things work, a narrative that mimics the ending of their first go-around in 2001. Earlier this week, an exclusive from People said that Affleck had not given her “any signs that he wants to continue their marriage.” (Court documents revealed that the couple had been separated since April.) Likewise, a source close to Lopez told the magazine that the singer spent “a lot of time making sure Ben was happy,” despite the actor being “<a href="https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-helped-ben-affleck-navigate-dark-side-source-exclusive-8701932">moody and dark.</a>” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another narrative that seems to be taking shape is that Lopez is making more of an effort to manage their blended family amid the current chaos. That includes Lopez’s twins Max and Emme, from her previous marriage to singer Marc Anthony, and Affleck’s three children, Violet, Fin, and Samuel, with his ex-wife Garner, who all lived together in their former mansion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last time Lopez and Affleck were <a href="https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-jennifer-garner-visit-ben-affleck-rental-house-son-samuel-graduation-party-8662839">spotted together</a> was in June for Affleck’s son Samuel’s graduation, when rumors of a breakup first started to emerge. Since then, Lopez has been spotted or photographed on <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/08/12/parents/jennifer-lopez-visits-ben-afflecks-rental-home-after-taking-his-son-samuel-shopping/">several outings</a> with Max and Violet, including a <a href="https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-hamptons-without-ben-affleck-fourth-of-july-8673175">4th of July trip</a> to the Hamptons. (People noted that Affleck was back in LA at the time.) Most recently, the magazine <a href="https://people.com/ben-affleck-has-not-been-in-touch-with-jennifer-lopez-kids-exclusive-source-8701044">reported</a> that Affleck “has not been in touch” with Lopez’s children.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While we haven’t been bombarded with claims about Lopez’s part in their demise or photo ops with his children, the fact that Affleck is not saying much, while allowing Lopez to make more of a show out of their divorce, seems like its own strategy, too.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong><em>The Greatest Love Story Never Told</em> foreshadowed this PR chaos&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since their first breakup, Affleck has given the public the impression that Lopez was more comfortable in the limelight than him. It’s something he reiterates throughout Lopez’s Prime documentary <em>The Greatest Love Story Never Told, </em>which premiered in February. The actor joked about Lopez’s impulse to publicize everything — including the stack of love letters he sent her before their 2021 reunion — but claimed that he was now willing to sacrifice his privacy to be with her. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Likewise, Lopez is portrayed as more needy for public attention, while Affleck is reluctant to participate in her projects and public antics. The sheer amount of paparazzi photos of Affleck would immediately dispel this claim, including those famous pap walks with his ex-girlfriend Ana de Armas during the pandemic. Days after the divorce, People <a href="https://people.com/ben-affleck-had-control-over-documentary-about-marriage-to-jennifer-lopez-exclusive-8701006">reported that multiple unnamed sources</a> had told the publication that Affleck, whose production company Artists Equity took on Lopez’s documentary, had creative control over the project.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2121052565.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Affleck and Lopez walking out of a brownstone on March 30, 2024 in New York." title="Affleck and Lopez walking out of a brownstone on March 30, 2024 in New York." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez out and about in New York. | MEGA/GC Images" data-portal-copyright="MEGA/GC Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking back on the film through this lens, you can see how dedicated they both are to protecting their image, while also seemingly a bit clumsy at it. The documentary, which follows the behind-the-scenes making of Lopez’s visual album <em>This Is Me… Now</em>, is full of humiliating and awkward (but extremely amusing) moments that the average pop star nowadays wouldn’t dream of being broadcast. At the time, the documentary seemed like the one saving grace in an era of misfires for Lopez, including a low-performing visual album and a canceled tour. Nevertheless, memes about Lopez — including a scene where she’s mythologizing her childhood hairdo — took off, in addition to random clips of Lopez supposedly displaying diva behavior. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Lopez struggled to make the public care about her new music, she kept people invested in her personal life with Affleck. The odd-couple dynamic they portrayed in the film was sweet and admirable. Lopez was depicted as the outgoing partner with unrealistic ambitions, while Affleck looked like the pragmatic but doting husband who supported his wife’s dreams. A memorable scene in the documentary shows Affleck boosting Lopez’s confidence when she’s feeling doubtful during the filmmaking process. Now, it’s hard not to wonder how much of this documentary factors into Affleck’s seeming escape plan.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Does either party have anything to gain?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With new exclusives about the details of their relationship arriving each day, it seems like the couple may be buckling up for a war that might leave both of their reputations a little scathed. For now, though, the media circus mostly feels gratuitous. But it’s sort of a humiliating ritual that these two celebrities from the ’90s would default to. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one thing, this is not the sort of explosive divorce that’s immediately inciting fans to take sides. Some<a href="https://x.com/TheyCallMeN1ka/status/1828238592214196329"> social media</a> <a href="https://x.com/MariaArriola4/status/1829181780458668194">users</a> are already <a href="https://x.com/SoumDesigns/status/1827778510397579317">calling</a> <a href="https://x.com/m0mmy_1ssues_/status/1827595484636016759">BS</a> on the narrative that Lopez was too public-facing for Affleck. But for the most part, Lopez and Affleck are two sometimes-loved-sometimes-hated celebrities, whose reputations are constantly in flux. Right now, it doesn’t seem like the public at large is jumping to demonize either one of them. The fact that their romantic history is reportedly<strong> </strong>riddled with dysfunction seems to be what makes them relatable and easy to root for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The divorce announcement itself also doesn’t seem that controversial. The details being revealed currently aren’t that explosive, besides the suggestion that Affleck has commitment issues. It certainly is not anything like the years-long fallout between <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2022/10/4/23388000/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-physical-domestic-abuse-allegations">Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie</a> following their divorce, which involves domestic and child abuse allegations and has left Pitt’s image with a stain — even if he’s still booked and busy in Hollywood. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to imagine these image-altering outcomes for Affleck simply for opting out of a marriage, even if the dissolution was as frosty on his end as some glossy celeb weeklies have depicted it. And after all, after all the breakups and career hits Lopez has experienced in the public eye, she has proven to be one of our most invincible celebrities. It’s all very predictable and not totally surprising — just like if they decided to get back together 20 years from now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates say it is a modest law setting &#8220;clear, predictable, <a href="https://time.com/7015197/ai-legislation-protects-more-than-just-people/">common-sense safety standards</a>&#8221; for artificial intelligence. Opponents say it is a dangerous and arrogant step that will “<a href="https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-statement-opposition-california-senate-bill-1047">stifle innovation</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, SB 1047 — California state Sen. <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/361562/california-ai-bill-scott-wiener-sb-1047">Scott Wiener’s proposal</a> to regulate advanced AI models offered by companies doing business in the state — has now passed the California State Assembly by a <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billVotesClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB1047">margin of 48 to 16</a>. Back in May, it passed the Senate by 32 to 1. Once the Senate agrees to the assembly’s changes to the bill, which it is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24229068/california-sb-1047-ai-safety-bill-passed-state-assembly-governor-newsom-signature">expected</a> to do shortly, the measure goes to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bill, which would hold AI companies liable for catastrophic harms their “frontier” models may cause, is backed by a wide array of AI safety groups, as well as luminaries in the field like <a href="https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wieners-landmark-ai-bill-passes-assembly">Geoffrey Hinton</a>, <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/08/15/yoshua-bengio-californias-ai-safety-bill-will-protect-consumers-innovation-tech/">Yoshua Bengio</a>, and <a href="https://safesecureai.org/experts">Stuart Russell</a>, who have warned of the technology’s potential to pose massive, even existential dangers to humankind. It got a surprise last-minute endorsement from <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1828205685386936567">Elon Musk</a>, who among his other ventures runs the AI firm <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/27/24165619/elon-musk-xai-startup-6-billion-funding">xAI</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lined up against SB 1047 is nearly all of the tech industry, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225648/openai-letter-california-ai-safety-bill-sb-1047">OpenAI</a>, <a href="https://static.politico.com/e0/fd/e56dfaad40b39f29dd1dfa1164da/sb-1047-letter-6-25-24.pdf">Facebook</a>, the powerful investors <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91175604/big-tech-lobbyists-ai-safety-bill-gavin-newsom">Y Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz</a>, and some <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E2yDGXryPhhlwS4OdkzMpNeaG5r6_Jxa/view">academic researchers</a> who fear it threatens <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/2/24058484/open-source-artificial-intelligence-ai-risk-meta-llama-2-chatgpt-openai-deepfake">open source</a> AI models. Anthropic, another AI heavyweight, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364384/its-practically-impossible-to-run-a-big-ai-company-ethically">lobbied to water down the bill</a>. After many of its proposed amendments were adopted in August, the company said the bill’s <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/4zrzovbb/website/6a3b14a98a781a6b69b9a3c5b65da26a44ecddc6.pdf">“benefits likely outweigh its costs.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the industry backlash, the bill seems to be popular with Californians, though all surveys on it have been funded by interested parties. A recent poll by the pro-bill AI Policy Institute <a href="https://theaipi.org/april-voters-prefer-ai-regulation-over-self-regulation-2-3-2/">found 70 percent of residents</a> in favor, with even higher approval ratings among Californians working in tech. The California Chamber of Commerce commissioned a bill <a href="https://prospect.org/power/2024-08-28-tech-industry-push-poll-california-ai-bill/">finding a plurality of Californians opposed</a>, but the poll’s wording was slanted, to say the least, describing the bill as requiring developers to “pay tens of millions of dollars in fines if they don’t implement orders from state bureaucrats.” The AI Policy Institute’s poll presented pro and con arguments, but the California Chamber of Commerce only bothered with a “con” argument.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The wide, bipartisan margins by which the bill passed the Assembly and Senate, and the public’s general support (when not asked in a biased way), might suggest that Gov. Newsom is likely to sign. But it’s not so simple. Andreessen Horowitz, the <a href="https://a16z.com/about/">$43 billion venture capital giant</a>,&nbsp;has <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91175604/big-tech-lobbyists-ai-safety-bill-gavin-newsom">hired Newsom&#8217;s close friend and Democratic operative Jason Kinney to lobby</a> against the bill, and a number of powerful Democrats, including <a href="https://democrats-science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2024-08-15%20to%20Gov%20Newsom_SB1047.pdf">eight members of the US House</a> from California and former Speaker <a href="https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-statement-opposition-california-senate-bill-1047">Nancy Pelosi</a>, have urged a veto, echoing <a href="https://x.com/GarrisonLovely/status/1824236448310022453">talking points from the tech industry</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So there’s a strong chance that Newsom will veto the bill, keeping California — the center of the AI industry — from becoming the first state with robust AI liability rules. At stake is not just AI safety in California, but also in the US and potentially the world.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s inside SB 1047</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To have attracted all of this intense lobbying, one might think that SB 1047 is an aggressive, heavy-handed bill — but, especially after several rounds of revisions in the State Assembly, the actual law does fairly little.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would offer <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353933/openai-open-letter-safety-whistleblowers-right-to-warn">whistleblower protections to tech workers</a>, along with a process for people who have confidential information about risky behavior at an AI lab to take their complaint to the state Attorney General without fear of prosecution. It also requires AI companies that spend more than $100 million to train an AI model to develop safety plans. (The extraordinarily high ceiling for this requirement to kick in is meant to protect California’s startup industry, which objected that the compliance burden would be too high for small companies.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what about this bill would possibly prompt months of hysteria, intense lobbying from the California business community, and unprecedented intervention by California’s federal representatives? Part of the answer is that the bill used to be stronger. The initial version of the law was based the threshold for compliance on computing power, meaning that over time, more companies would have become subject to the law as computers continue to get cheaper (and more powerful). It would also have established a state agency called the “Frontier Models Division” to review safety plans; the industry objected to the perceived power grab.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another part of the answer is that a lot of people were falsely told the bill does more. One prominent critic <a href="https://www.hyperdimensional.co/p/californias-effort-to-strangle-ai">inaccurately claimed</a> that AI developers could be guilty of a felony, regardless of whether they were involved in a harmful incident, when the bill only had provisions for criminal liability in the event that the developer <a href="https://safesecureai.org/responseletter">knowingly lied under oath</a>. (Those provisions were subsequently removed anyway). <a href="https://lofgren.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/lofgren.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/8.7.24%20to%20Senator%20Wiener.pdf">Congressional representative Zoe Lofgren of the science, space, and technology committee wrote a letter</a> in opposition falsely claiming that the bill requires adherence to guidance that doesn’t exist yet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the standards do exist (<a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ai/NIST.AI.800-1.ipd.pdf">you can read them in full here</a>), and<em> </em>the bill does not require firms to adhere to them. It says only that “a developer shall consider industry best practices and applicable guidance” from the US Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute, National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Government Operations Agency, and other reputable organizations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of the discussion of SB 1047 unfortunately centered around straightforwardly incorrect claims like these, in many cases propounded by people who should have known better.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">SB 1047 is premised on the idea that near-future AI systems might be extraordinarily powerful, that they accordingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment">might be dangerous</a>, and that some oversight is required. That core proposition is extraordinarily <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/21/18126576/ai-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-safety-alignment">controversial</a> among AI researchers. Nothing exemplifies the split more than the three men frequently called the “godfathers of machine learning,” Turing Award winners Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yann LeCun. Bengio — a <a href="https://www.vox.com/23924495/yoshua-bengio-scientific-director-mila-quebec-ai-institute-future-perfect-50-2023">Future Perfect 2023 honoree</a> — and Hinton have both in the last few years become convinced that the technology they created may kill us all and argued for regulation and oversight. Hinton <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html">stepped down</a> from Google in 2023 to speak openly about his fears.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">LeCun, who is chief AI scientist at Meta, has taken the opposite tack, declaring that such worries are nonsensical science fiction and that any regulation would strangle innovation. Where Bengio and Hinton find themselves supporting the bill, LeCun opposes it, especially the idea that AI companies should face liability if AI is used in a mass casualty event.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this sense, SB 1047 is the center of a symbolic tug-of-war: Does government take AI safety concerns seriously, or not? The actual text of the bill may be limited, but to the extent that it suggests government is listening to the half of experts that think that AI might be extraordinarily dangerous, the implications are big.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s that sentiment that has likely driven some of the fiercest lobbying against the bill by venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose firm a16z has been working relentlessly to kill the bill, and some of the highly unusual outreach to federal legislators to demand they oppose a state bill. More mundane politics likely plays a role, too: <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2024/08/19/ai-pelosi-house-seat-00174542">Politico reported</a> that Pelosi opposed the bill because she’s trying to court tech VCs for her daughter, who is likely to run against Scott Wiener for a House of Representatives seat.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why SB 1047 is so important&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It might seem strange that legislation in just one US state has so many people wringing their hands. But remember: California is not just any state. It’s where several of the world’s leading AI companies are based.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And what happens there is especially important because, at the federal level, lawmakers have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/technology/ai-schumer-roadmap-congress.html">dragging out</a> the process of regulating AI. Between Washington’s hesitation and the looming election, it’s falling to states to pass new laws. The California bill, if Newsom gives it the green light, would be one big piece of that puzzle, setting the direction for the US more broadly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rest of the world is watching, too. “Countries around the world are looking at these drafts for ideas that can influence their decisions on AI laws,” Victoria Espinel, the chief executive of the Business Software Alliance, a lobbying group representing major software companies, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/10/technology/california-ai-regulation.html">told</a> the New York Times in June.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even China —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23621198/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-china-ai-safety-technology">often invoked as the boogeyman in American conversations</a> about AI development (because “we don’t want to lose an arms race with China”) — is showing signs of <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/08/25/is-xi-jinping-an-ai-doomer">caring about safety</a>, not just wanting to run ahead. Bills like SB 1047 could telegraph to others that Americans also care about safety.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Frankly, it’s refreshing to see legislators wise up to the tech world’s favorite gambit:&nbsp;claiming that it can regulate itself. That claim may have held sway in the era of social media, but it’s become increasingly untenable.&nbsp;We need to regulate Big Tech. That means not just carrots, but sticks, too.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Newsom has the opportunity to do something historic. And if he doesn’t? Well, he’ll face some sticks of his own. The <a href="https://theaipi.org/april-voters-prefer-ai-regulation-over-self-regulation-2-3-2/">AI Policy Institute’s poll</a> shows that 60 percent of voters are prepared to blame him for future AI-related incidents if he vetoes SB 1047. In fact, they’d punish him at the ballot box if he runs for higher office: 40 percent of California voters say they would be less likely to vote for Newsom in a future presidential primary election if he vetoes the bill.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Israeli military launched the largest, deadliest West Bank attack&nbsp;of the year on Wednesday, killing at least 16 people, including a high-ranking militia commander, over the course of several days. Violence in the West Bank —&nbsp;perpetrated by the military, Israeli settlers, and Palestinian fighters —&nbsp;has been steadily accelerating over the past 10 months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the October 7 Hamas raid on Israel, at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-forces-say-they-kill-local-hamas-commander-west-bank-2024-08-30/">660 Palestinians</a> and <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/israel-west-bank-operation-death-toll-climbs/#:~:text=At%20least%2015%20Israelis%2C%20including,the%20attacks%2C%20the%20United%20Nations">15 Israelis</a> have been killed in the West Bank, according to the United Nations. It’s a smaller number than the more than 40,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza over the past 10 months, but it is still a reminder of how intense ongoing violence in the West Bank is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Israeli military has conducted several raids in Palestinian refugee camps since the start of the war in Gaza. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/29/israel-operation-west-bank-gaza-war/">latest operation</a> started early Wednesday morning: Air and ground forces targeted Tulkarm in the northwest, Jenin at the territory’s northern border, and Far’a refugee camp <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/where-we-work/west-bank/fara-camp">in the territory’s east</a>. Shin Bet, an Israeli security service affiliated with the country’s intelligence groups, and the Israel Border Police were also involved in the raids, which ostensibly targeted what Israeli officials called “terrorist infrastructure.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel claims Mohamed Jaber — a commander of a group affiliated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad — and Hamas commander Wassem Hazem were both killed, along with other militants during the raid. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-forces-say-they-kill-local-hamas-commander-west-bank-2024-08-3">Israeli officials accused Hazem of plotting,</a> along with other militia members, attacks within the West Bank. Like Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad helped commit the October 7 attacks; both groups also claimed responsibility for<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/19/world/middleeast/tel-aviv-bomb-hamas.html"> a suicide attack in Tel Aviv earlier this month</a>, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-blast-hamas-war-palestinians-3f491deecaa3dab14047c7ab982c2dd8">which wounded one Israeli</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you think about it from this sort of tactical perspective, suicide bombers are most likely to be coming from the West Bank, more so than Gaza, probably because Gaza is already a war zone,” Raphael Cohen, director of the strategy and doctrine program of RAND Project Air Force, told Vox, adding that Hamas officials have called for increased suicide attacks against Israeli territory. That may be part of what motivated Israel’s recent operation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is also a rising number of Palestinians taking up arms in the West Bank generally, some due to anger and horror over the brutal destruction of Gaza, but also because military raids and attacks by Jewish settlers in the West Bank are increasingly violent and terrorizing. Saif Aqel, a youth leader with the Fatah political group, told the Washington Post that Jaber had been radicalized by Israel’s repeated West Bank raids, saying, “The environment he was living in made him like this.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As part of its operation this week, the Israeli military has blocked and destroyed roads and blocked entrances to hospitals, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/29/israel-operation-west-bank-gaza-war/">according to witnesses</a>, as well as shut off electricity, water, mobile, and internet service. The Israeli military has disputed that it blocked access to medical facilities.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Violence in the West Bank has been going on for decades</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The West Bank sits to Israel’s east, bordering Jordan and the western shore of the Dead Sea. Before 1967, Jordan controlled the region; Israel then captured the territory and held it under military occupation until the 1993 Oslo Accords, when it was carved up into three “areas,” supposedly under the control of the Palestinian Authority. However, <a href="https://israelpolicyforum.org/west-bank-settlements-explained/">Jewish Israeli settlement of the area</a> accelerated,&nbsp;and the Israeli military also moved in to protect them. Now, the Palestinian Authority, which is the nominal government, has little actual control in the West Bank.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaza, Jerusalem, and the West Bank are recognized as occupied territory under international law, and therefore Israel is obligated to protect the people living there. Israel denies that it is occupying Palestinian lands, but just last month, the <a href="https://www.icj-cij.org/sites/default/files/case-related/186/186-20240719-pre-01-00-en.pdf">International Court of Justice</a> ruled that Israel is occupying Palestinian lands and should end that occupation immediately.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under that order, which is enforceable by the UN Security Council, “Israel must withdraw its forces from all parts of the occupied territories, including the Gaza Strip and remove all settlers from the West Bank, including from the illegally annexed East Jerusalem,” Erika Guevara Rosas,&nbsp;Amnesty International’s senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/07/icj-opinion-declaring-israels-occupation-of-palestinian-territories-unlawful-is-historic-vindication-of-palestinians-rights/">said in a statement</a>. Israel’s allies on the security council, including the United States, have given no indication they intend to enforce the court’s decision.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That has allowed Israel to continue its war in Gaza, and left Palestinians living in the West Bank trapped in a cycle of violence: There have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/world/middleeast/israel-palestinian-west-bank-clashes-timeline.html">at least five major Israeli military operations</a> in the West Bank since October 7, and settler violence has increased as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These settlers are Israelis — often aligned with the country’s right wing and often heavily armed&nbsp;“to the teeth,” according to Diana Buttu, a Palestinian-Canadian lawyer specializing in international human rights law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They have increasingly expanded the number of settlements into land the United Nations has said is supposed to be off-limits to Israeli control. Israel refers to them as “illegal” settlements but does not stop people from building outposts, or from <a href="https://www.btselem.org/topic/settlements">forcing Palestinians out of their homes and off their land</a>. Some settlers have begun to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/16/israel-settlers-attack-violence-palestinians/">push closer to cities as well</a>. Settlements are also frequently subsidized by the Israeli government, which provides them with higher-quality infrastructure, roads, water, and schools in their settlements than what the government provides Palestinian villages.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some Palestinians have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/08/28/west-bank-palestinians-militants-israel-raid/">taken up arms against these settlers</a>, and sanctioned Israeli military operations have encouraged vigilantism and new anti-Israel militant groups as well. Israel has sent in more troops in response, creating what seems to be an inescapable cycle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The cities [in the West Bank] are supposed to be free of army presence, but the army has been carrying out these raids, so these [militant] groups arose in response,” Joost Hiltermann, director of the Middle East program at the International Crisis Group, told Vox. “So then the army responds to these groups, and you&#8217;ll see an escalation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jenin city and the refugee camp on its outskirts — two sites that saw fighting this week — are <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/7/4/the-occupied-west-bank-city-of-jenin-a-focal-point-of-conflict-2">frequent targets</a> since, as Buttu explained, they and all of Gaza are the main sites of Palestinian resistance in the occupied territories.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, there’s little sign either the militants or Israel will change their strategies in the West Bank, and that has some countries — particularly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/08/30/world/israel-hamas-gaza-war/israeli-forces-pull-back-from-tulkarm-but-press-on-with-their-raid-of-jenin-officials-say?smid=url-share">France and Britain</a> — worried that the increasing violence will turn the West Bank into another Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A controversy over the Trump campaign’s behavior during a visit by Trump to Arlington National Cemetery last Monday has stretched for days with no end in sight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In part, the controversy is about the law: Federal law prohibits campaign or election activity at military cemeteries. In a larger sense, it’s yet another example of Trump flouting longstanding norms of decorum and ethical conduct — to the outrage of many, but not all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s team, it seems clear, wanted to use the military cemetery visit for political benefit. When a cemetery staff member tried to prevent Trump campaign aides from taking photographs and filming near servicemembers’ graves, a Trump aide physically pushed her aside.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Furthermore, once word of this incident leaked out, Trump’s campaign aides viciously insulted the cemetery staffer in startlingly personal terms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one fell swoop, Trump’s team managed to violate norms against politicizing veterans’ sacrifices, shoving people, and ugly personal attacks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump campaign has defended itself by pointing out that the family members of the servicemembers being memorialized that day have not protested his actions. Several of them <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113037529550199315">have defended</a> Trump, and they’re the ones who invited Trump to the cemetery in the first place, in part because <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/08/29/gold-star-families-rip-biden-over-kabul-airport-blast/">they blame</a> Biden’s handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal for their loved ones’ deaths.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What exactly happened with Trump at Arlington National Cemetery?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Monday was the third anniversary of the August 26, 2021, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/27/22643461/isis-k-kabul-airport-afghanistan-taliban">Kabul airport attack</a> — a suicide bombing during the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan that left 13 US service members dead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some family members of those killed have blamed the attack on the Biden administration’s handling of the withdrawal, and have aligned with the Trump campaign — including by appearing <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2024/jul/18/families-of-13-fallen-us-service-members-emotional/">at the Republican national convention</a> in July. And when planning an Arlington cemetery event to mark the attack’s third anniversary, they invited Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since it is the height of the presidential campaign season, and since Trump has long criticized the Biden administration’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-michigan-afghanistan-war-46eb2b0861939bf022747920c0ee0234">handling</a> of the Afghanistan withdrawal, US defense officials were concerned that the event could become inappropriately or even illegally political, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/28/trump-arlington-cemetery-section-60/">Washington Post reports</a> — that it was a campaign event in disguise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, officials laid down some restrictions. One was that Trump wasn’t supposed to bring his campaign staff. Another was that, after an initial ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier that was open to the press, Trump’s visits to individual veterans’ graves, in a section of the cemetery <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/28/nx-s1-5092041/arlington-trump-section60-veterans-altercation">reserved primarily for veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan</a>, would be private.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump brought campaign aides anyway. And two of those aides — a campaign photographer and a videographer — tried to go with Trump to the individual graves. An Arlington cemetery staff member tried to stop the aides, but, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/08/28/trump-arlington-cemetery-section-60/">per the Post</a>, “a larger male campaign aide insisted the camera was allowed and pushed past the cemetery employee, leaving her shocked.” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery">According to NPR</a>, Trump campaign staff also “verbally abused” the official.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the ceremony, the Trump campaign organized a press call in which several family members of the servicemembers killed at Kabul praised Trump and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-harris-have-never-once-reached-out-gold-star-families-13-fallen-servicemembers-say">criticized</a> Biden and Harris.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What has happened since then?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">News of the altercation became public on Tuesday, when <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery">NPR reported on the incident</a>. Trump campaign spokespeople <a href="https://x.com/TheStevenCheung/status/1828575389783933439">claimed</a> they had permission to bring a photographer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They also claimed the cemetery staff member wasn’t pushed — but viciously derided her anyway. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung asserted that she was “clearly suffering from a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/27/nx-s1-5091154/trump-arlington-cemetery">mental health episode</a>,” and co-campaign manager Chris LaCivita called her “despicable.” (Her name has not been made public, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/29/us/politics/trump-arlington-cemetery-army.html">the New York Times reported</a> that military officials “feared that the employee would face retaliation from Trump supporters if her identity became known.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s team also <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113037529550199315">posted a statement</a> from several family members of two of the soldiers who died in the Kabul attack. “We had given our approval for President Trump’s official videographer and photographer to attend the event,” the statement says. (The permission of the families, however, has no bearing on the federal law prohibiting campaign activity at the cemetery.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The president and his team conducted themselves with nothing but the utmost respect and dignity,” the family members’ statement continues.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican who was also in attendance, <a href="https://x.com/GovCox/status/1828089276359414118/photo/2">posted a photo</a> in which Trump stood with some veterans and family members by a grave, giving a thumbs-up. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s team subsequently <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@realdonaldtrump/video/7407571442088430878?lang=en">made a TikTok video</a> including footage from the grave visits, with a voiceover from Trump blaming the Biden administration for the veterans’ deaths — clearly using the event for political purposes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Family members of one Green Beret whose grave was seen in these photos and videos (but who was not killed in the Kabul attack) issued a statement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/28/us/politics/trump-arlington-cemetery.html">expressing concern</a> that Trump aides did not follow cemetery rules on filming and taking photos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday, the US Army — which manages Arlington National Cemetery — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/29/politics/us-army-rebukes-trump-campaign-arlington-incident/index.html">issued its own statement</a> backing the cemetery staff member and asserting that she was indeed “abruptly pushed aside” for attempting to assure adherence to the ban on political activities on cemetery grounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,” the statement said. However, it went on, the employee decided not to press charges, so the Army now “considers this matter closed.”</p>

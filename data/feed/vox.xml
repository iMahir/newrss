<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite being a time when people from all over the <a href="https://www.vox.com/sports/363338/2024-paris-olympics-opening-ceremony-winners-losers">world come together</a> in <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/ioc-defends-paris-gender-parity-150754383.html">equality</a> and peace, the Olympics are still uncertain territory for transgender athletes. There are <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/trans-athletes-paris-olympics/">no transgender athletes</a> who are competing outside of the gender they were assigned at birth at this year’s Games. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/08/1243548261/naia-transgender-athlete-sports-ban">Transgender women</a> who transitioned after puberty aren’t allowed to compete in major sports on a college level. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Athletes <a href="https://glaad.org/releases/fact-sheet-for-reporters-middle-distance-runner-nikki-hiltz-and-transgender-nonbinary-athletes-participation-in-the-2024-paris-olympics/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwwae1BhC_ARIsAK4JfryotNtDV30-iNJ8xxD9wmkOL1Z_pWApL89LLkwrazvIeUwR4RCFa8YaAnCLEALw_wcB">Nikki Hultz</a>, a runner, and <a href="https://www.outsports.com/2024/7/31/24098788/hergie-bacyadan-trans-athlete-boxing-paris-olympics/">Hergie Bacyadan</a>, a boxer, both identify as transgender (Hultz also identifies as nonbinary), but both have always and continue to compete in the women’s division, which is the sex they were assigned at birth.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Athletes who do not identify as trans, like Algerian boxer Imane Khelif, have also been scrutinized for their gender. Along with China’s Lin Yu-ting, Khelif is one of <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2024/08/olympic-boxers-gender-test-controversy-explained.html">two women boxers</a> who failed a “<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/episode/sex-testing-in-the-olympics-and-other-elite-sports-is-based-on-flawed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex test</a>” from the International Boxing Association last year. They have since been connected to discussions of sports and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/olympics/olympics-dsd-rules-focus-womens-boxing-2024-07-31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Differences of Sexual Development (DSD)</a>, a rare group of genetic and hormonal disorders allowed under International Olympic Committee guidelines.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outside of the Games, trans people face so much <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/12/27/21028342/trans-visibility-backlash-internet-2010">backlash</a>, often for simply existing. The conversation around <a href="https://www.openlynews.com/i/?id=3b588a4f-0564-4eb7-8afc-291e51eae543">sports</a> is particularly fraught, from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/28/1138396067/transgender-youth-bills-trans-sports">children’s athletics</a> right up through the <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2023/06/transgender-athletes-sports-debate-lance-armstrong.html">pros</a>. Despite the International Olympic Committee vowing to be <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-publishes-updated-portrayal-guidelines-to-help-ensure-gender-equal-fair-and-inclusive-media-coverage-of-paris-2024">more inclusive</a>, the future for trans athletes is unclear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It all raises the question: How did we get to this point, and did it always have to be this way?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answers found in historian and journalist Michael Waters’s <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374609818/theotherolympians"><em>The Other Olympians: Fascism, Queerness, and the Making of Modern Sport</em>s</a><em> </em>might be surprising<em>. </em>Waters’s book traces the emergence of Zdeněk Koubek, a track and field star representing the country formerly known as Czechoslovakia who, at 21, won two medals — a gold in the 800m and a bronze in the long jump — at the 1934 Women’s World Games. (The Women’s World Games was the precursor to women competing at the Olympics). In 1935, Koubek announced that he would be living life as a man and swiftly became an international celebrity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps the most intriguing facet to Koubek’s story was in the public response. Koubek was more welcomed and celebrated than we might imagine. There was an open-mindedness and empathy to the reception of Koubek and his gender identity and expression in the 1930s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Waters also pinpoints where and when that changed, specifically at the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany. Armed with a propensity for eugenics, gender anxiety, and a startling lack of scientific evidence, a small set of Nazi officials influenced the International Olympic Committee into gender surveillance and trans panic — stuff that eerily mirrors the transphobic attacks that athletes, <a href="https://x.com/buttonslives/status/1817737387369267707">cis</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/transgender-swimmer-lia-thomas-speaks-backlash-future-plans/story?id=85068951">trans</a> alike, face today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In reading Waters’s account of Koubek and other trans and intersex athletes’ lives, it all feels like those Olympics were a breaking point. The Nazi era has substantially shaped the conversation surrounding trans athletes today.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This conversation was edited and condensed for length and clarity. As Waters notes in </em>The Other Olympians<em>, we use different and more specific language to signify transgender and intersex identity today, making it difficult to fully translate stories from the past into contemporary language. We refer to Koubek with male pronouns because that’s how he expressed his gender identity publicly after his transition.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I want to ask you, how did you find out about Koubek? I’ve never heard of him. I was so surprised —&nbsp; in a good way! All the details about his life — how he loved running, how he got famous — how did you find his story?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s sort of the reaction I had when I first came across him. History, especially before World War II, is full of the stories of queer people in the community kind of existing and becoming prominent way before you might expect.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What I found is that the way we would describe queer people, whether in terms of sexuality or gender transition — those phrases have changed so much over time, but when you know what [terms or phrases] might have been used in a specific era, you can actually find some really interesting stories.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 1930s, a lot of transitions would be described as “sexual metamorphoses,” which is this weird technical word. Because this is a time before we have a concept of gender, it sort of comes from this idea that something had spontaneously changed in these people’s bodies, and then they’re a man or woman.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Obviously, language has changed now and I think there’s a general effort to be more conscious of the terms we’re using. Back then, people didn’t have the words or language when it comes to gender identity and expression.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I had a preconceived notion of queer history as generally bleak to awful. Like something out of </strong><strong><em>Mad Max.</em></strong><strong> And from reading your book, I was surprised to find that it wasn’t exactly that.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah, I mean, I think it’s really easy to think of like, before World War II and especially even before Stonewall generally as this dark period where there can’t be public embraces of queerness.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s so much more complicated than that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>You point out in Koubek’s case that he becomes a celebrity and is even welcomed. This is all relative, but there seems to be a lot of open-mindedness and positivity in a lot of the coverage following Koubek.</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a bit of sensationalism to the coverage. There is a little bit of fascination because he is one of the few prominent people who is sort of transitioning. Reporters get his pronouns wrong all the time. In some articles, you see every conceivable pronoun used to describe him.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I think through it all, you see this real empathy and curiosity about transition and what’s possible medically in terms of logistics. People are interested in this idea of these categories of&nbsp;male and female, and what you’re assigned at birth is not as set in stone as they would have expected.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Right. I don’t want to give them too much credit, but the media’s coverage of Koubek wasn’t as painful or as terrible as I expected, especially when you consider how trans people are covered and written about today.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In that vein of looking at today, I think the stark thing in your book&nbsp;is that you see when and where the narrative surrounding Koubek and other athletes shifts. That’s the Olympics in Nazi Germany.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What was so interesting to me is that these [current] Olympic sex testing or eligibility policies have their historical roots in 1936. And those historical roots really, I think, are in this anxiety over women athletes. In the 1930s, there’s just a general fear of masculine women in sports and this idea of sports, especially a sport like track and field, as being both somehow dangerous to health, but also imperiling this really strict notion of femininity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that Koubek, in some way, proves the fears of mostly male sports officials who were worried that the act of playing sports is changing something in women athletes and sort of masculinizing them in this way that they found intolerable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Yes, absolutely. They used fear and suspicion as a cudgel and anyone — you note that Jewish athletes also face similar kinds of discrimination — who didn’t conform to their ideas of “norm” got punished.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just the fact that in the 1930s, the conception was this idea of a medical exam, which was this kind of strip test. The strip test would be given out if a competitor had a question about another one of their competitors. You can just sort of force your competitor to be physically examined by a doctor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I think you can see some of that nastiness permeate into sports today. It’s not unlike some of the conversations surrounding </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/3/11/8189679/serena-williams-indian-wells-racism"><strong>Serena Williams</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://x.com/Simone_Biles/status/813947733816016896"><strong>Simone Biles</strong></a><strong> throughout their careers. They’re often accused of being too masculine or muscular, and there have been insinuations that they dope or derisions that their bodies aren’t feminine enough. It’s a nefarious accusation.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, this all starts with the origin of the Olympics. Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the Olympics, didn’t want women to play in sports, full stop. There are many quotes about how he didn’t like the sight of women athletes. Women athletes were looked at with suspicion.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>The current </strong><a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/pierre-de-coubertin/the-rationale-behind-coubertins-opposition-to-women-competing-in-the-olympic-games"><strong>Paris Olympics website</strong></a><strong> has an entire — not entirely convincing — page on de Coubertin’s views and how his sexist ideologies may have been a product of their time.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This really helped cement this idea that there was something or there could be something unfeminine about successful athletes. That’s also tied to race and class. The first Olympic sports for women are sports like tennis and golf which, at the time, were really associated with the white upper class.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I think tennis, especially, is still considered a more feminine sport today.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yeah. So there’s that important starting point, you have this fear-mongering about female athletes. Maybe a few women are okay if they play a certain kind of sport and they fit this notion of femininity, but there is real anxiety about what sports would do to the idea of gender in some way.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I think what you’re getting at is that women athletes, to make people more comfortable, had to perform and present themselves in a non-threatening, traditionally feminine way. I think that still happens in sports today when you look at who gets rewarded with sponsorships and deals and who gets to be the face of women’s sports.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In reading your book, I found myself wondering a little bit about what would’ve happened to the conversation and policies surrounding trans athletes if things took a different turn in the 1930s.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s easy to just assume that this is how sports had to be. It’s just really this specific coalition of officials who didn’t have the best morality in other aspects of their lives and political beliefs —&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>A coalition of officials who were really into … Nazi Olympics!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a little bit counterfactual, but I do think, at the very least, it’s also important to see that these sorts of restrictive policies weren’t inevitable and to see how they were constructed and who constructed them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To the IOC’s credit, they released this policy statement in 2021 where they at least gestured at the idea of greater inclusion for trans and intersex athletes as well as women athletes with high hormone levels — groups that are often banned from competition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do believe that we are capable of having that conversation. And I do think the IOC statement suggests that there is some interest in talking about making sports more inclusive. But obviously, I think the policies on the ground at the Paris Olympics this year don’t really reflect that.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Technology is on its way to getting a little bit safer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US Senate on Tuesday <a href="https://apnews.com/article/senate-child-online-safety-vote-f27c329679feb2d74787fc3887aa710f">passed a pair of bills</a> — the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and the Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA 2.0) — <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/352251/kosa-congress-online-child-safety-bill-explained">designed to protect kids online</a>. It’s shockingly bipartisan: The vote to approve the package of bills was 91 to 3. That broad support is a big deal, but it’s far from a done deal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The legislation, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/us/politics/senate-child-online-safety-bill-house.html">still has to clear the House of Representatives</a>, would create a sweeping set of rules requiring platforms to mitigate harm related to mental health and sexual exploitation, among other things. KOSA also calls for platforms to cut back on features that cause compulsive use, including notifications and auto-play. Critics of the KOSA, however, say that it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/technology/kosa-child-online-safety.html">opens the door to censorship</a>, since certain kinds of speech could be blocked in the name of protecting children.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sorting out the best way to balance First Amendment rights and protecting kids online will take more time. The House has already gone home for August recess, and the presidential election this November will be on everyone’s mind when they come back to consider their version of KOSA, which is <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/whats-different-about-the-us-house-version-of-the-kids-online-safety-act/">slightly different</a> but also includes a duty of care to protect young people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone can agree that keeping kids safe online is important, but one straightforward element of the legislation may help kids and adults alike: curbing compulsive use.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smartphones <a href="https://hbr.org/2024/02/do-you-have-a-phone-addiction">can feel almost addictive</a> or at the very least like a bad habit. So how can we avoid spending hours staring mindlessly at a screen?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One way is to understand how and why you’re being compelled to spend so much time on smartphones. Another is simply to put your phone away. Seriously, like, put it in another room where you can’t see it or touch it until you really need it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The slot machine in your pocket</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You’ve probably struggled with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/14/1105122521/stop-revenge-bedtime-procrastination-get-better-sleep">staying awake scrolling</a> at night instead of sleeping or <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/what-happens-to-your-brain-when-you-get-a-phone-notification-19256076">felt triggered by the ding of a new notification</a>. That’s largely because many apps, including games and social media platforms, have been designed to captivate your attention and keep you coming back.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The explanation for these kinds of behaviors can be traced back to the work of psychologist B.F. Skinner. While a graduate student at Harvard in the 1930s, <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html">Skinner invented a type of puzzle box</a> — that psychologists and technologists now call a Skinner box — equipped to study the behavior of rats and pigeons.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one famous experiment, when the animals pulled a lever or tapped a piece of glass, they were given positive reinforcement, like a piece of food. Skinner realized that once they figured out the cause and effect, the animals would only pull the lever when they were hungry. But if Skinner introduced randomness into the equation, and the animals didn’t know if they were going to get a reward, they kept pulling the lever again and again, sometimes obsessively. One pigeon <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/if-the-internet-is-addictive-why-don-t-we-regulate-it">tapped the glass 2.5 times per second for 16 hours</a> in search of a reward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A little over a decade ago, <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/natasha-schull">Natasha Schüll</a>, a cultural anthropologist and associate professor at NYU, wrote a book called <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691160887/addiction-by-design"><em>Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas</em></a>. And she was surprised that lots of people were using her research to describe how social media traps people in the same ways that the blinking boxes on a casino floor do. In an interview, she compared certain apps to Skinner boxes and likened the experience of mindlessly browsing photos on Facebook to slot machines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You keep clicking as if you’re going to hit some little jackpot, where you recognize someone or it gives you some point of interest,” Schüll told me. “So you just keep going.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She added, “There&#8217;s something that really puzzles the mammalian brain about that and keeps you at it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our phones are full of Skinner boxes designed to draw us in and compel us to perform simple actions in search of random rewards. For the slot machine, the positive reinforcement is money. But in social media apps, as Schüll said, it’s less clear what we’re looking for, which might explain why we open up TikTok at bedtime, blink a couple of times, and two hours have passed. Why platforms want us to do this is very clear, however. The more time we spend using the app and engaging with it — tapping notifications, scrolling through videos, and so forth&nbsp;— the more data about our behavior the platform gets and the more money they can make by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/skinner-marketing-were-the-rats-and-facebook-likes-are-the-reward/276613/">selling this data or access to your attention to advertisers</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand <em>how</em> these machines were designed to keep us hooked, we have to look at the work of B.J. Fogg, who pioneered the field of computers as persuasive technologies, or captology, in the late ’90s. He now simply calls it behavior design. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/274644.274677">In Fogg’s own words</a>, “a persuasive computer is an interactive technology that can change a person’s attitudes or behaviors,” and Silicon Valley loves this idea. Fogg founded <a href="https://behaviordesign.stanford.edu/people/bj-fogg">the Behavior Design Lab at Stanford</a>, which has become a breeding ground for startup founders. One of its most famous former students is Mike Krieger, co-founder of Instagram. <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2016/10/20/the-scientists-who-make-apps-addictive">According to the Economist</a>, “Fogg took ambivalent satisfaction from the example of Instagram, since he felt distantly responsible for it and perhaps distantly guilty.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it wasn’t the academics who built the Skinner boxes in our pockets. It was, at the end of the day, software engineers who probably paid less attention to psychology textbooks than they did to how we actually used these apps.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The features that keep us hooked and how to avoid them</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the latest version of the bill, KOSA includes a provision for tech companies to change the way their platforms are designed in order to keep kids from spending so much time using their apps. The legislation specifically mentions “automatic playing of media, rewards for time spent on the platform, notifications, and other features that result in compulsive usage of the covered platform by the minor.” If the bill becomes law, the features that result in compulsive usage will probably still exist for the rest of us, and that seems like a problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you know what the features that cause compulsive use are, you can stop yourself from getting sucked in.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Autoplay and notifications are obvious ones that you can — and should — turn off in your phone. (Here’s <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-turn-off-autoplay-videos">a handy guide</a> that covers how to turn off autoplay in a wide range of apps, and here are <a href="https://gizmodo.com/these-are-the-only-push-notifications-you-should-allow-1834720375">some tips</a> for managing notifications.) Endless scrolling is a similar feature that’s not so easy to turn off. Some apps, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/how-to/how-to-use-instagrams-new-take-a-break-feature-and-have-the-app-remind-you-to-stop-scrolling/articleshow/88215889.cms">like Instagram</a>, have a feature that will prompt you to take a break or set a daily limit. Apple and Google both offer suites of features to limit how much you’re using certain apps. (In iOS, it’s called <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108806">Screen Time</a>, and it’s <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9346420?hl=en">Digital Wellbeing</a> in Android.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3 Easy Things to Do</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Nobody should feel helpless in our app-saturated world. But even without new legislation putting guardrails on certain platforms, you can update your settings to make your phone less habit-forming. Tristan Harris, a former student of B.J. Fogg and co-founder of the Center for Humane Technology, offered three tips <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17053758/phone-addictive-design-google-apple">in a 2018 Vox video</a> that still make sense today:</p>



<ol>
<li>Turn off all non-human notifications</li>



<li>Make your screen grayscale</li>



<li>Restrict your home screen to essential, everyday tools</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if you are able to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17053758/phone-addictive-design-google-apple">pare down</a> some of the features that compel you to keep using an app, others are practically inescapable: algorithmic feeds and personalized content, for example. Algorithmic feeds <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/social-media-algorithms-warp-how-people-learn-from-each-other/">are designed to keep you scrolling</a>, searching for an unspecified reward — not unlike one of Skinner’s rats pulling a lever in search of a treat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While KOSA would give kids the option to turn this off easily, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-see-instagram-facebook-twitter-chronological-order/">it currently takes some work</a> to do it in apps like Facebook, Instagram, and X. Personalized content, however, is virtually impossible to avoid, since most social media apps are designed to learn what you like and suggest more content like it. That’s what powers the algorithms that not only feed you content but also personalized notifications, recommendations, and of course, ads.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Inevitably, software features that cause compulsive use aren’t just in social media apps. They’re everywhere, from your banking app to your favorite mobile games. Those red dots indicating you have unread notifications? <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9246170/">That’s a cue</a> that you might be missing out on a reward. The pull-to-refresh gesture that you might use to load new content? <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3023421/why-the-pull-to-refresh-gesture-must-die">There’s no technical reason for that to exist</a>; it’s just compelling you to engage with the app more directly (the gesture even mimics the pull of a slot machine handle). The buttons to like and favorite things? Well, first of all, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/technology/facebook-like-share-buttons.html">research shows they cause anxiety</a>. But they also give algorithms feedback so that they can deliver even more personalized content and continue to keep you on the app.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So do all these tricks and features really <a href="https://www.passkosa.org/about-kosa">make these apps addictive</a>? To call an algorithm “addictive” makes social media sound like a drug you just can’t quit, and it brings to mind US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/355795/technology-should-social-media-come-with-a-warning-label">recent call for warnings on social media platforms</a> that hearkens back to similar warnings on cigarette packs. The idea that social media is addictive also makes it seem like there’s nothing we can do to stop ourselves from using it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s more productive to think about social media overuse <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/digital-addiction-breakable-habit/2021/02/05/25959f9a-662b-11eb-886d-5264d4ceb46d_story.html">as a bad habit that you can break</a>, according to <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/wendy-wood/">Wendy Wood</a>, provost professor emerita of psychology and business at USC Dornsife College. Features like notifications and algorithmic feeds full of personalized content are designed to be habit-forming, and when you’re stressed or tired, people lose the ability to ignore certain impulses and control their habits, according to Wood.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Using that label addiction makes people feel more out of control, makes people feel like they are less able to change their own behavior,” Wood told me. “It pathologizes something that has positive as well as negative effects … and it really depends on how people are using it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, she’s talking about adults here. Kids are different. There is research that links certain changes in brain function <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/health/social-media-brain-adolescents.html">with heavy social media use in some teens</a>, and the American Psychological Association is on record saying young people <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/apa/2022/social-media-children-teens">face a higher risk of harm from social media use</a> since their prefrontal cortex is not fully developed, meaning they can’t regulate emotions the same way an adult would. And those are only a couple of examples from <a href="https://www.anxiousgeneration.com/research/collaborative-review-docs">a growing body of research</a> on the strong negative effects social media has on children and adolescents.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another easy suggestion to keep yourself or your teen from getting pulled into the vortex of notifications, endless streaming content, and algorithmic hypnosis? Put your phone in the other room. Researchers at the University of Texas <a href="https://news.utexas.edu/2017/06/26/the-mere-presence-of-your-smartphone-reduces-brain-power/">found</a> that the mere presence of a smartphone can reduce cognitive ability. It’s also just a distraction, a reminder that there is a virtual world of limitless, unpredictable rewards within your reach.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But you can’t pull the lever if you can’t see it or touch it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Look around and you might see it: the telltale signs that the #Resistance has been born again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A-list celebs <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/the-beat-with-ari/watch/losing-trump-rattled-as-harris-taps-stars-from-beyonce-to-megan-thee-stallion-216037445643">are rallying for and endorsing</a> Vice President Kamala Harris; Zoom calls of Black, Latino, female, and young voters are <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harris-supporters-by-ethnic-background-white-dudes-b474af62f6b225c71cde16be7e9eb077">reaching capacity</a>; the coconut-tree and brat memes keep coming.

<p class="has-text-align-none">The political movement that materialized organically, protested policy decisions, and eventually helped end Donald Trump’s presidency may now be taking on a second political life with the goal of not just beating Trump, but electing the first woman president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this was a sure thing. Just a few months ago it looked a lot like the anti-Trump #Resistance was <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/26/trump-win-activism-philanthropists-00137965">dead</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Progressive organizers and activists were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/us/politics/trump-resistance-democrats-voters.html">exhausted</a>; Trump fatigue had settled in. And voters of all kinds <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/02/06/political-news-consumption-down-2024-election">were tuned out</a> and <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/15/double-haters-biden-trump-favorability">unenthusiastic</a> about the candidate choices they had.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That dynamic has flipped — for now. But what remains uncertain is whether this energy can mobilize record numbers of voters like it did in 2020, or if it exists in a bit of an echo chamber, like the energy that fired up Hillary Clinton’s hardcore supporters but failed to produce a winning coalition.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How the #Resistance fell off</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The sour vibes earlier this year were a far cry from the energy that dominated during the Trump years. The Resistance was born after the unexpected election of Trump in 2016. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/1/17/14267766/womens-march-on-washington-inauguration-trump-feminism-intersectionaltiy-race-class">pink hats</a> marched on Washington the day after his inauguration; plenty more college-educated Americans, women, young people, suburban voters, and LGBTQ people were mobilized in those early Trump years to protest the Muslim ban, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/3/26/17160646/march-for-our-lives-crowd-size-count">gun violence</a>, and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/6/14/17463732/families-belong-together-rally-protest-separate-children-immigrants">separation of families</a> at the southern border.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The energy carried on. “<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Resist%20Liberal">Resist libs</a>,” as they were sometimes derisively called by both disapproving leftists and hostile conservatives, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/1/17/21068870/2020-womens-march-washington-election-women-voting">voted</a> in record numbers during the 2018 midterms and helped flip the House of Representatives. They <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/fauci-rbg-and-liberal-bobblehead-dilemma/620235/">rallied</a> around special counsel Robert Mueller’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/why-were-liberals-so-desperate-to-believe-that-mueller-would-save-democracy/2019/03/28/0b8a3286-50cb-11e9-8d28-f5149e5a2fda_story.html">investigations</a> into Trump and Russia, and they cheered then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the first Trump impeachment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A sprawling Democratic primary field in 2019 helped to keep this cohort of liberal, college-educated, and suburban voters galvanized. By the time the 2020 election came around — and despite the pandemic hampering some of these organizing efforts — the primarily liberal movement had grown along with a loose alliance of disaffected independents and Republicans, progressive youth, and many voters of color to form a winning coalition that ousted Trump from the White House and delivered a Democratic majority in Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That movement <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/11/conor-lamb-aoc-democrats-fighting-socialism/617045/">quickly splintered</a> once Biden won, and those divisions only <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/513305/democrats-ratings-biden-slip-overall-approval.aspx">grew</a> as his presidency continued. The overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> in the summer of 2022 did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/25/upshot/female-voters-dobbs.html">fuel</a> a short-lived revival, as pro-abortion rights voters and the remnants of the Resistance turned out in that November’s midterms to stop election deniers and anti-abortion candidates, holding back a red wave. But the outbreak of the Gaza War, stubbornly high inflation, and concerns over Biden’s age all worked to tamp down that anti-Trump energy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/first-read/poll-finds-lagging-democratic-enthusiasm-2024-election-rcna117132">end of 2023</a>, only 68 percent of Democrats had high interest in the election, compared to 75 percent of Republicans.  The same story <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-biden-trump-tight-race-election-interest-low-rcna148170">remained</a><a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-immigration-economy-inflation-abortion-21b95914866c2af3a1e7af8e302dbe27"> true</a> throughout this year: Americans hated their options. Shares of double-haters <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/15/double-haters-biden-trump-favorability">reached record highs</a>, making up about a quarter of all adults by this June. Throughout it all, Republicans remained loyal to Trump: in <a href="https://smpa.gwu.edu/gw-politics-poll-reveals-challenges-facing-biden-even-first-debate">one poll before the June 27 debate</a>, 60 percent of Trump voters said they were “very enthusiastic” to vote for him. Only 43 percent of Biden supporters said so. Biden’s support among Democrats collapsed after the June presidential debate. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The vibe shift is real</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now with Harris at the top of the ticket, much of the Democratic base has reconsolidated. The enthusiasm that a lot of the media coverage has picked up on is real — specifically among Democrats. Whereas only 62 percent of Democrats were enthusiastic about voting back in February, 88 percent of Democrats say that they are now, according to <a href="https://x.com/ForecasterEnten/status/1817918460992934320">a CNN comparison of polls</a> by Ipsos and Monmouth University. The switch-up is so dramatic that <a href="https://x.com/ForecasterEnten/status/1817918460992934320">Democrats are now outpacing Republicans</a> in terms of how excited they are to vote for their party’s nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, part of this bounce back in support can be attributed to just how unhappy Democrats and voters in general were with Biden as the nominee. But there are plenty of signs that a new kind of energy has reanimated the disparate constituencies that make up the Democratic base and were at the heart of the first incarnation of the anti-Trump resistance movement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Within days of Biden dropping out of the race and Harris becoming the presumptive nominee, tens of thousands of Americans have joined organizing calls specifically focused on <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-07-30/2024-election-white-dudes-black-women-identity-groups-harris">mobilizing identity groups</a>: <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/win-with-black-women-zoom-call-harris-organizers/">44,000 people</a> joined a “Win With Black Women” Zoom call the same day Biden dropped out; <a href="https://x.com/kairosdemocracy/status/1815820528445214768">45,000 joined</a> a “Win With Black Men” call; <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/white-women-kamala-speaker-tells-viewers-never-correct-black-women-put-our-listening-ears-on">164,000</a> joined a “White Women: Answer the Call” Zoom meeting; similar meetings were organized for <a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/07/kamala-harris-president-vice-2024-biden-white-dudes.html?pay=1722452355622&amp;support_journalism=please">white men</a>, for Latina women, and will be held for Latino men.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What makes these different from standard campaign coalition-building is that they are primarily being organized by the same kinds of activist groups and organizations that were important during the rise of the original #Resistance — groups like Run for Something, <a href="https://x.com/aapialliance/status/1818341066481033494">Indivisible</a>, Moms Demand Action, and Swing Left. Many function independently of any official Democratic campaign or the party itself. Others are newer, like Voters of Tomorrow or Gen Z for Change, which focus on reaching younger voters, or are issuing their first political endorsements, like <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/march-for-our-lives-presidential-endorsement/">March for our Lives</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it’s too early to say if this shift will last, or if we’re just in the middle of a honeymoon period of excitement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Voters may become dissatisfied again — almost half of Democrats still say they feel <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/us/politics/kamala-harris-biden-poll.html">scared or apprehensive about the election</a> — and that’s why a revived #Resistance will be more crucial than ever. More than the memes, more than the merch, what Harris needs is classic organizing. The groups that are mobilizing now, especially those reaching voters of color and younger voters, say that this is just the start of their efforts to reengage segments of the electorate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A consistent level of engagement will be necessary to ensure that the optimistic feelings of the last few weeks cement themselves into the kind of 2020 #Resistance king of mobilization, instead of the just-vibes, era-of-good-feelings that permeated the Democratic electorate in 2016 —&nbsp;and failed to stop Trump the first time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearly two months after launch&nbsp;and almost 50 days after they were initially supposed to return to Earth, two astronauts stuck at the International Space Station finally appear to be closer to their homeward voyage. That they were trapped by troubles with their Boeing Starliner&nbsp;spacecraft has only raised fresh doubts about the company’s technological and engineering capabilities as it weathers several major scandals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two astronauts who made the journey on the Starliner, Barry “Butch” Wilmore and Sunita “Suni” Williams, have been at the ISS longer than initially intended, though NASA and Boeing both insist the astronauts are not “stranded,” as some headlines have indicated. They have reserves of oxygen and supplies and could use other spacecraft docked at the station if they needed to make a quick exit back to Earth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The trip was always intended as a test voyage for the spacecraft, and Boeing and NASA have said that the time spent understanding and fixing the spacecraft’s issues — multiple&nbsp;helium leaks and thrusters that shut off unexpectedly —&nbsp;while it was in space was valuable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We don’t understand the issues enough to fix them permanently, and the only way that we can do that is take the time in this unique environment and get more data, run more tests,” <a href="https://www.space.com/boeing-starliner-nasa-astronauts-not-stranded-space">Mark Nappi</a>, vice president and program manager of Boeing&#8217;s commercial crew program, said in a <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-boeing-starliner-crew-flight-test-mission-delays-webcast">June press conference</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Saturday, NASA and Boeing engineers performed tests on 27 of the spacecraft’s 28 thrusters, the system that propels the Starliner into space. On Tuesday, the <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/boeing-crew-flight-test/2024/07/30/nasa-boeing-complete-second-docked-starliner-hot-fire-test/">space agency announced</a> that the tested thrusters were performing well enough to bring the spacecraft back to Earth, and that after looking at the testing data, Boeing and NASA would determine a date for the vessel and its crew to leave the station.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this means Boeing’s space program is on track; it has struggled ever since its initial contract with the US government was signed, and it’s not clear whether the company will be able to change course in time for the Starliner to be ready for the missions it was designed for.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How the Boeing Starliner’s test mission expanded from 10 days to 55 and counting</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">NASA and Boeing’s initial plan was to have the Starliner bring astronauts to and from the ISS on a regular basis by this year. To do that safely meant test flights like this one, as problems —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/28/virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-cause">even deadly ones</a> — are not unheard of when it comes to space travel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Starliner, though, faced problems before even getting off the ground. The initial launch date, May 6, was delayed because of a faulty pressure regulation valve on the liquid oxygen tank that, along with a source of liquid hydrogen, <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/Rocketology/tag/liquid-oxygen/">enables rocket propulsion</a>. Then, a helium leak in the <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Gaia/Service_module">service module</a> — where the <a href="https://www.space.com/boeing-starliner-nasa-astronauts-not-stranded-space">propulsion system is located</a>, many of the craft’s instruments are held, and which disconnects from the spacecraft during the return to Earth — pushed back the new scheduled May 25 launch date.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though engineers understood that leak to be manageable, three other helium leaks emerged when the spacecraft docked on June 6 at the ISS. Another problem, this time with five of the Starliner’s 28 reaction control systems thrusters, which help the spacecraft navigate, emerged then, too. That meant the spacecraft was unable to dock at the ISS until engineers on the ground could figure out how to position the spacecraft to dock safely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After testing both on the ground at the White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico and in space, the thrusters seem to be working appropriately, which will be critical for getting the astronauts back down to Earth. Essentially, the crew will now be able to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/nasa-astronauts-wait-space-station-boeing-tests-rcna164276">point the Starliner</a> in the right direction before different engines propel it on the return journey. The helium leaks, too, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/nasa-astronauts-wait-space-station-boeing-tests-rcna164276">seem to have stabilized</a>. However, there is still no date set for a return mission.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t see this as being anything critical, or life-threatening,” Laura Forczyk, the executive director of the space consulting group Astralytical <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/03/nx-s1-5026448/boeing-starliner-astronauts-space-station-return">told NPR</a>. “I just think they’re being extra cautious as they should be, because this vehicle is not operating as intended.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Boeing commercial space project has been a fraught one, and it’s not just this Starliner test mission.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the joint venture between Boeing and NASA was started in 2014, there have been three problematic launches. The spacecraft’s 2019 test flight had to be cut short due to a software issue that prevented docking at the ISS. (There was no crew aboard this flight.) The Starliner, still uncrewed, successfully docked at the ISS in 2022, although there were several other technical problems in the intervening years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the meantime, Elon Musk’s SpaceX has made several successful trips into space since 2020 —&nbsp;and one of the vehicles that Williams and Wilmore could use to come back to Earth should some other issues arise with the Starliner is <a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/dragon/">SpaceX’s Dragon</a> spacecraft.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Boeing’s been in big trouble lately</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Starliner’s first mission, carrying at least <a href="https://www.space.com/crew-flight-test-starliner-1-certification-schedule-question">three astronauts</a>, is tentatively scheduled for <a href="https://www.space.com/boeing-starliner-iss-hot-fire-reentry-preparation">no earlier than August 2025</a>, in order to give the NASA and Boeing teams time to fix the issues that have emerged in this test flight. By that time, the entire purpose of the project will be nearly moot; the ISS is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/faqs-the-international-space-station-transition-plan/#:~:text=NASA%20has%20committed%20to%20fully,platforms%20in%20low%20Earth%20orbit.">scheduled to shut down in 2030</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Boeing’s space troubles are just part of the problems plaguing the company, which is primarily known as a commercial aircraft and <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract/Article/3600074/">defense industry</a> manufacturer. It has been under significant scrutiny because of the multiple dangerous failures of its 737 Max commercial plane.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was a terrifying incident in January, in which a door plug flew open on an Alaska Airlines flight, and two deadly plane crashes in 2018 and 2019. As Vox’s Whizy Kim <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/24052245/boeing-corporate-culture-737-airplane-safety-door-plug">wrote in January</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Other problems keep cropping up, with Boeing planes a common denominator: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/17/business/sec-of-state-antony-blinken-forced-to-change-planes-after-boeing-breaks-down/index.html">The failure of a Boeing 737 plane</a> that Secretary of State Antony Blinken had intended to fly on.

</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Boeing and Alaska Airlines are also embroiled in a lawsuit over the January incident. Boeing and the Justice Department have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/criminal/media/1361546/dl?inline">entered into&nbsp;a plea agreement</a> relating to the 2018 Lion Air and 2019 Ethiopian Airlines flights that killed 189 and 157 people, respectively. Boeing will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud the FAA in evaluating the 737 Max, likely avoiding a criminal trial that could expose further wrongdoing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the agreement, the company will be fined $487.2 million and will owe restitution to the victims’ families, who are already <a href="http://theguardian.com/business/article/2024/jul/31/boeing-737-max-crash-victims-reject-doj-plea-deal">opposing the deal</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Boeing’s many serious missteps are, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/3/15/24100817/boeing-crash-safety-aviation-flying">as Vox’s Marin Cogan wrote in March</a>, due at least in part to a highly corporatized structure at the company that in recent decades has focused less on solid engineering than on shareholder returns.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of the issues —&nbsp;the backed-up space program, the serious incidents involving the 737 Max —&nbsp;are part of the same problematic system at Boeing. Whether the company will face its problems and change its operations remains to be seen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conversation went off the rails within the first few minutes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking Wednesday to three Black female reporters at the National Association of Black Journalists’ annual convention, former President Donald Trump was expected to make an appeal to Black voters, contrast his appearance with Vice President Kamala Harris’s absence from the event, and, of course, face some tough questions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of using the interview to present a positive case for the audiences that a roomful of Black journalists cover and inform, he immediately slid into the vindictive, petty, and confrontational persona that first shocked many Americans during the 2016 campaign, came to dominate daily life during Trump’s presidency, and which many Americans may have forgotten about since.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t think I’ve ever been asked a question in such a horrible manner. …  I think it’s a very rude introduction. I don’t know exactly why you would do something like that,” Trump told ABC News’ Rachel Scott after she asked Trump about his history of making offensive statements about Black politicians and journalists. “I think it’s a very nasty question. &#8230; I have been the best president for the Black population since Abraham Lincoln.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rest of the Q&amp;A went about as well, with Trump taking swipes at the reporters interviewing him, complaining about the sound system and equipment, doubling down on pardoning January 6 rioters, and most shockingly, questioning Harris’s racial and ethnic background.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,” Trump said of Harris while answering a question about Republicans calling Harris a “DEI hire.” “I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Donald Trump claims he didn’t know Kamala Harris was Black while being interviewed at NABJ convention:<br><br>“She was always of Indian heritage […] I didn’t know she was Black until years ago when she happened to turn Black. Is she Indian or Black?”<br><br> <a href="https://t.co/KDjD30WH5Z">pic.twitter.com/KDjD30WH5Z</a></p>&mdash; Pop Base (@PopBase) <a href="https://twitter.com/PopBase/status/1818734755783098837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since leaving office as the most unpopular president (until Biden) and at a low point in favorability, Trump has managed to repair his reputation with significant chunks of the American electorate. His <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/">net negative favorability rating</a> has nearly halved since January 2021; he has grown <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24105970/donald-trump-popularity-favorability-rising-latino-black-young-working-class">more popular</a> with younger voters, voters of color, and lower-income voters since his presidency ended.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He has managed to do so as he consolidates support among the Republican base with more blatantly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-ramps-violent-rhetoric-rcna118438">violent</a> and <a href="https://x.com/JimPethokoukis/status/1812747068668088504">negative</a> rhetoric since his first campaign in 2016. An NBC News analysis of Trump’s public statements since leaving office, for example, found the former president’s rhetoric taking a “<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-ramps-violent-rhetoric-rcna118438">dark and aggressive</a>” turn that ramped up in fall 2023, while other academic work has found his usage of “<a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w32665">violent vocabulary</a>” increasing in recent years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So how has Trump simultaneously fired up his base while appealing to voters outside of it?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve previously combed through a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24105970/donald-trump-popularity-favorability-rising-latino-black-young-working-class">few theories</a> for how Trump pulled this off, but Wednesday’s appearance at the NABJ conference brings to mind one in particular: The less people see of Trump, the more they like him. And for the past few years, people have simply seen less of Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Attention to political news has dropped, people have tuned out of national politics, and Biden became the target of the public’s anger and dissatisfaction with a variety of international, economic, and political crises. Facing Biden, he could run a quieter campaign, receive muted attention, and speak to his base while the rest of the public remained tuned out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">(It also helped that many of the newest voters entering the electorate also <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/05/biden-young-voters-polling-2024/678436/">did not remember</a> a lot of the most offensive things he said while rising to the White House. In polling conducted by the Democratic firm Blueprint, most voters under 30 had never heard of him advocating for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States” or saying there were “very fine people on both sides” of the 2017 Charlottesville “Unite the Right” white supremacist rally.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump can’t stop himself from just being Trump, and given a chance, he can’t help but remind voters of who and how he is. On Wednesday, that meant putting forward an array of false, racist attacks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After lying about Harris’s Blackness, Trump repeated a go-to falsehood about Democrats supporting “partial-birth” abortions, that “they are radical on abortion … they are allowing the death of a baby even after it is born.” Scott and Semafor reporter Kadia Goba pushed back, pointing out this is illegal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the event, Trump, his campaign, and conservative allies have not just dug in but trumpeted the event. Trump repeated his attack of Harris <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/112883041451077389">on Truth Social</a>, saying, “Crazy Kamala is saying she’s Indian, not Black. This is a big deal. Stone cold phony. She uses everybody, including her racial identity!” A clip of a headline describing Harris as the first Indian-American senator from California was <a href="https://x.com/Olivianuzzi/status/1818756196599542210">projected</a> at his rally in Pennsylvania.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Trump campaign is projecting this on the screen above the stage at his rally in Harrisburg PA: <a href="https://t.co/ZsGHAZaruk">pic.twitter.com/ZsGHAZaruk</a></p>&mdash; Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) <a href="https://twitter.com/Olivianuzzi/status/1818756196599542210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The NABJ’s decision to invite Trump was controversial within the organization’s membership and caused public rifts among its leadership and membership. Some contended that the benefits of scrutinizing the former president’s record in a journalistically sound fashion outweighed the downsides. Others objected to handing the mic to someone with a long history of anti-Black and misogynistic rhetoric.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are strong arguments for and against interviewing Trump, but wherever you land on that, it was evident Wednesday that giving Trump a platform isn’t the same as giving him an advantage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“​​People should see this! A grumpy, cruel, hard-of-hearing, race-baiting, asshole having to actually answer for his track record in an environment outside of his comfort zone,” the “never-Trump” Republican strategist Tim Miller posted on X after the Trump interview.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That all is the more significant now that the race has reset, with Harris in and Biden out. With Trump out of the White House and off Twitter (now known as X), Americans could be forgiven for not remembering just how much they disliked Trump and how much he remains the same man who ran for office in 2016 and 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The campaign is in full swing and the spotlight is back on Trump, and this much is clear: Give Trump the opportunity to show the public who he is, and he’ll gladly do it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past few months, events in the Middle East have been giving the world a crash course in escalation management — or, more accurately, the failure to manage escalation. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the ongoing carnage in Gaza, the region is not quite in the state of all-out war that many have feared since last October. But it has lurched much closer to one that state over the past few days with a series of dramatic and violent developments, including the assassination on Tuesday night of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, in the Iranian capital of Tehran </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Haniyeh’s killing came just hours after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon, killed a senior commander of Hezbollah. That attack was in retaliation for a Hezbollah rocket strike that killed 12 children on a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights on Saturday. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s more: On Tuesday, the US <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosions-iraqs-pmf-security-agency-base-south-baghdad-kill-one-member-sources-2024-07-30/?oref=d_brief_nl&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20D%20Brief:%20July%2031%2C%202024&amp;utm_term=newsletter_d1_dbrief">carried out a strike</a> against an Iran-backed military group in Iraq, following several recent attacks on US forces in the region. Such <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24074393/deterrence-united-states-middle-east-iran-russia-military-drone">tit-for-tat strikes</a> between Iran-backed militants and regional US forces were common in the months following October 7, but almost none had taken place since early 2024. This raises concerns that the latest burst of violence could mark a troubling return to a period of near-open conflict between the US and Iranian proxies. Recent days have also seen Israel carry out <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/21/middleeast/israel-strikes-houthi-rebels-explainer-intl/index.html">airstrikes in Yemen</a> for the first time, responding to a drone strike on July 19 by Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis that killed one person in Tel Aviv.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just how high are the risks? <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-29/ty-article/.premium/all-is-still-quiet-on-the-iranian-front-the-calm-could-be-misleading/00000189-9d12-de97-af9f-ff9fcbf40000">Haaretz reports</a> that earlier this month, the Institute for National Security Studies, an Israeli think tank, conducted a war game that began with a “mysterious assassination in Tehran that was attributed to Israel.” The game ended, ominously, with US airstrikes on Iran and an all-out regional war. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Games like this are meant to help policymakers map out potential scenarios, not predict the future. And strange as it may seem given days of strikes and counterstrikes in a region that has remained on edge for months, all of the actors — Israel, Iran, Hezbollah, and the US — are still likely trying to keep it to a manageable level. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s the ultimate paradox. We’re getting closer to a war, but war is still unlikely because nobody wants it,” Bilal Saab, a former Defense Department official and Middle East analyst, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there have been many wars throughout history that were started without anyone actively desiring one. The paradox is that even if Israel and Iran don’t want war, their actions are only making one more likely.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Killing the negotiator</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Haniyeh, 62, had been a member of Hamas since its founding in the 1980s and served for a time as prime minister of the Palestinian Authority after Hamas’s victory in the 2006 Palestinian elections. Haniyeh left Gaza in 2019 and resided mainly in the Qatari capital of Doha. He served as the group’s public face and international representative but had little day-to-day control of its operations in Gaza, which were overseen by Yahya Sinwar, the group’s leader within the enclave. Three of Haniyeh’s children and several of his grandchildren had already reportedly been killed by Israeli strikes within Gaza.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given his distance from the front line in Gaza, Haniyeh’s killing is likely to have little impact on Hamas&#8217;s conduct of the war with Israel. It is, almost certainly, a body blow to ongoing ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, which a US official described last week as being in the “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-ceasefire-negotiations-appear-be-closing-stages-senior-us-official-says-2024-07-24/">closing stages</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Haniyeh was far from a “moderate” in any reasonable sense of the word, but according to some reports, within the Hamas leadership he was the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67103298?oref=d_brief_nl&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20D%20Brief:%20July%2031%2C%202024&amp;utm_term=newsletter_d1_dbrief">strongest advocate for a ceasefire</a>. On Wednesday, the prime minister of Qatar, where the group’s political leadership is based and which has served as a mediator in the talks, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/qatar-pm-says-how-can-mediation-succeed-when-one-side-assassinates-negotiator-2024-07-31/">tweeted</a>, “[H]ow can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?&#8221; </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Haniyeh’s killing again puts a ceasefire out of reach, that’s grim news for the people of Gaza, where fighting is ongoing and where <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/">more than 39,000 people</a> have already been killed since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It also raises the risk of the conflict spreading. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah has been <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24153755/hezbollah-israel-lebanon">launching rockets and drones</a> against northern Israel and Israel has been responding in kind since the very beginning of the war. Though the heavily armed militant group likely wants to avoid another all-out war with Israel — it suffered significant losses the last time that happened, in 2006 — it can’t halt its attacks as long as the war in Gaza continues without losing credibility as an opponent to Israel. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That almost surely means more incidents like the one that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/27/world/middleeast/israel-golan-heights-lebanon-rocket.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">killed 12 children</a> in a Druze village in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights on Saturday. (Hezbollah denied responsibility but did admit to several barrages of rockets at northern Israel that day.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Every day that there’s not a ceasefire in Gaza, the northern border is becoming more and more hot,” Vali Nasr, a professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, told Vox. “And also Iran and Houthis and others are becoming more directly involved in the war. It’s becoming more difficult to manage the situation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And while Hezbollah’s retaliation could be meaningful, the real question is what Iran will do after Israel has managed to penetrate its defenses and kill a high-profile ally under its protection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How will Iran respond?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It seems very likely to me that Hezbollah is going to have to take some sort of escalatory action,” Jonathan Lord, a former Pentagon official director of the Middle East Security program at the Center for a New American Security, told Vox. “And because Israel struck Haniyeh inside Tehran, Iran also is going to need to likely take some sort of action to restore confidence in their national sovereignty.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel is believed to have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-fakhrizadeh-assassination-israel.html">carried out several assassinations</a> on Iranian soil in recent years, mainly of figures involved in Iran’s nuclear program, though the Israeli government almost never publicly acknowledges these actions and has not done so in this case. The killing of an official as prominent as Haniyeh, though, and the fact that he was in Tehran for the inauguration of Iran’s new president raise the profile of the incident and the pressure on Iran to respond. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed to retaliate, saying, “<a href="https://www.euronews.com/2024/07/31/hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-assassinated-in-tehran-says-iran">We consider his revenge as our duty</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In April, after Israel carried out an <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/4/2/24119425/israel-attack-syria-damascus-strike-iran-officials-reza-zahedi-gaza-war-united-states">airstrike in Damascus</a>, Syria, that killed a senior Iranian general at an Iranian diplomatic building, Tehran <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-launches-drone-attack-israel-expected-unfold-over-hours-2024-04-13/">responded by launching </a>hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel. This was unprecedented — Iran generally strikes Israel via proxy groups rather than directly — but also seemed deliberately calibrated to avoid escalation. While Iran has <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/19/iran-unveils-upgraded-hypersonic-missile-as-khamenei-touts-israel-failure">hypersonic missiles</a> in its arsenal, it used <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68811273">slower-moving weapons</a>, most of which were intercepted. Only one civilian in Israel was seriously injured. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/31/world/middleeast/iran-orders-attack-israel.html?smid=nytcore-android-share">reported on Wednesday</a> that Khamenei has issued an order for Iran to again directly strike Israel, but the nature of escalation is that the ante has to be raised.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel may also not be Iran’s only target of retaliation. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken <a href="https://www.state.gov/secretary-antony-j-blinken-with-teresa-tang-of-channel-news-asia/">said on Wednesday</a> that the killing of Haniyeh “is something we were not aware of or involved in.” This is likely true, but the Iranians aren’t buying it. In a letter to the UN Security Council, Iran’s representative condemned the US as well as Israel, <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/iran-urges-un-security-council-to-convene-urgently-amid-assassination-of-hamas-leader/3291477">writing</a>, “This act could not have occurred without the authorization and intelligence support of the US.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group, told Vox that Iran’s response is likely to be an “Axis-wide retaliation against the US and Israel.” (The “Axis of Resistance” is the umbrella term for the network of Iran-backed proxies that includes Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and several militias in Syria and Iraq.) “That means coordinated, simultaneous attacks, which, of course, are much more perilous and much more difficult to contain,” Vaez added.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also means that whatever form Iran’s retaliation takes, the US and its troops and interests in the region may be on the receiving end of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The crisis is a trial by fire for Iran’s new president, who is literally in his first week on the job. Masoud Pezeshkian’s swearing-in was accompanied by chants of “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-president-sworn-with-chants-death-america-israel-2024-07-30/">death to America</a>” and attended — in addition to Haniyeh — by representatives of the Houthis, Hezbollah, and other Axis of Resistance groups. But Pezeshkian is considered a moderate compared to his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a plane crash in May. The hope is that Pezeshkian may be more open to negotiation with the United States. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This new president came into office, I believe, with the blessing of a supreme leader, to test the waters again about arriving at some kind of negotiated settlement with the United States,” said Nasr. President Joe Biden came into office in 2021 <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/ace813c84258f4fec80039c0456f4707d">vowing to revive the nuclear deal</a> with Iran, which was negotiated under Barack Obama in 2015 before being abandoned by Donald Trump in 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Iranians have been moving ahead with their nuclear program in recent weeks, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-nuclear-weapons-sullivan-blinken-2ba2de90dce5047c4a698b2d57a90e4b">statements by US officials</a>. While Iran and the US have been able to compartmentalize their relations in the past — holding nuclear talks even as militias and the US military traded fire — depending on what form Iran’s retaliation takes, that may prove impossible this time around </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Closer to Israel, the US is also likely keeping a wary eye on further escalation between Israel and Hezbollah, arguably the most powerful non-state military in the world. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin said <a href="https://www.jpost.com/international/article-812574">on Tuesday</a> that he doesn’t see full-scale war as “inevitable,” but that if it breaks out, “We will help Israel defend itself.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given all these events, one might reasonably ask what sort of “escalation” can still occur, short of all-out regional conflict. Israel and Hezbollah are still not fighting on the ground. There’s still no sustained fire between Israel and Iran. US troops are still not directly involved in the fighting, beyond carrying out periodic airstrikes and coming under the occasional fire from militants.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the guardrails are getting weaker, the situation is getting more intense and dangerous. But this is the Middle East — things can always get worse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Editors note: In July 2024, while speaking at the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) conference, former <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american">President Donald Trump questioned Vice President Kamala Harris’s racial identity</a>, saying: “She was always of Indian heritage. She was only promoting Indian heritage, I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black,” Trump said. “So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?”</em> <em>This story, first published in 2020 and updated in 2021 when Harris was sworn in as vice president, discusses America&#8217;s difficulties with talking about the identities of multiracial people.</em></p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />

<p class="has-text-align-none">The swearing-in of Kamala Harris as vice president of the United States was a historic moment that celebrated other historic firsts: The first Latinx Supreme Court Justice, Sonia Sotomayor, did the honors as Harris’s hand rested on the Bible that belonged to Thurgood Marshall, the first Black Supreme Court justice.</p>

<p>In her new role, Harris will break many barriers of her own: She is the first woman, first Black person, and first person of South Asian descent to become the vice president of the United States.</p>

<p>But such boundary-breaking is never without strife. When Harris was nominated in August, her biracial identity prompted much discussion on social and traditional media about her background as the daughter of an Indian immigrant mother and a Jamaican immigrant father. While some South Asian voters were upset that this part of her identity has long been downplayed, others were excited about the historic nature of her nomination and what it represents for South Asian American women and women of color. Meanwhile, some Black voters debated whether she is truly “Black enough,” and far-right critics pushed birther-style arguments, questioning whether Harris is a US citizen and her eligibility for vice president.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter alignnone"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My mother always use to say, “Don’t just sit around and complain about things. Do something.” I dearly wish she were here with us this week. <a href="https://t.co/RHO2VnlZs4">pic.twitter.com/RHO2VnlZs4</a></p>&mdash; Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) <a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1293891559671422977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But her multiracial identity shouldn’t have been new information. Harris has had a long career in public life: She was a San Francisco district attorney, the California attorney general, a US senator, and ran for the Democratic nomination for president last year. And yet for years, she has primarily been identified as a Black woman in the public eye, with her South Asian identity rarely mentioned in media coverage until fairly recently. Some of this could be a personal choice — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/i-am-who-i-am-kamala-harris-daughter-of-indian-and-jamaican-immigrants-defines-herself-simply-as-american/2019/02/02/0b278536-24b7-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html">a longtime friend of Harris’s told the Washington Post in 2019</a> that he had only learned she was also of South Asian descent after knowing her for 15 years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>[RELATED: <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/364172/trump-nabj-black-voter-journalist-racist-kamala-harris-indian-american">Speaking to Black journalists, Trump reminded everyone how racist he can be</a>]</em></p>

<p>For multiracial people, defining their racial identity in America can be a complex and fraught issue because of other people’s assumptions and expectations. And what the energy expended on debating Harris’s identity tells us is that we still have a long way to go when it comes to talking about multiracial people in America.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Media coverage has long focused on Harris’s Black identity, and discrimination against Black people plays a role in that</h2>

<p>When Harris won her Senate seat in 2016, news coverage repeatedly highlighted that she was only the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/meet-kamala-harris-second-black-woman-elected-u-s-senate-n680726">second</a><a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-senate-race-kamala-harris-wins-20161108-story.html"> Black</a><a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2016/06/13/kamala-harris-aims-to-make-history-in-california-again/"> woman</a> elected to the Senate (the first was Carol Moseley Braun, in 1992). But her victory that day also represented another milestone that some of those same news outlets did not mention: She was also the first South Asian American person elected to the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor of public policy at the University of California Riverside and founder of <a href="http://aapidata.com/">AAPI Data</a>, suggested earlier this year that one of the reasons Harris might be more commonly portrayed as Black in the media is because of America’s history of using the “one-drop rule,” a racist practice that dates back to slavery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“When you had someone who is the son or daughter of a Black person and a white person in the South, they would have been considered a slave and not a free person, and that legacy continued on through Jim Crow. They would not have the same rights as white people if you had even ‘one drop’ of Black blood. So that legacy is still very powerful; it affects not only how white people or American society in general think of Black folks but also how Black folks think of themselves,” Ramakrishnan told Vox.</p>

<p>Black Americans have historically faced much deeper oppression and systemic racism than Indian Americans, and as <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/kamala-harris-indian-american-identity-vp-pick.html">Slate’s Nitish Pahwa notes</a>, “the Indian experience is nowhere near as central to American politics and to American life and history as is the Black experience.” Black Americans also face much deeper injustices than any other racial or ethnic group in America: They’re more likely to be killed by police, and at the moment they are <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/4/7/21211849/coronavirus-black-americans">disproportionately affected by Covid-19</a> as well as <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/5/6/21248330/coronavirus-black-americans-depression">unemployment</a> and the economic crisis.</p>

<p>Growing up Black in America is also a very different experience from growing up Indian in America, as Indians have frequently benefited from “model minority” stereotypes — the false belief that Asian Americans are smarter, more hardworking, or more successful than other racial and ethnic groups. It’s <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2017/04/19/524571669/model-minority-myth-again-used-as-a-racial-wedge-between-asians-and-blacks">a trope that has been used as a “racial wedge”</a> between Asian Americans and Black Americans.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21758870/GettyImages_1168768931.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,6.1017152523127,100,87.796569495375" alt="A Howard University yearbook page that includes a picture of Kamala Harris." title="A Howard University yearbook page that includes a picture of Kamala Harris." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Kamala Harris (bottom row, second from right) in a Howard University yearbook. | Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images" />
<p>Diana Sanchez, a Rutgers University professor who studies multiracial identity in America, noted that research has shown that “when you have Black ancestry in your background, and this is seen as the lower-status group in society, people will tend to categorize you along those lines.” Sanchez added that Harris’s “South Asian identity might be perceived as higher status because of the way discrimination works and some of the positive stereotypes that exist for Asian American groups compared to Black American groups. So she is likely to be categorized as a Black candidate.”</p>

<p>Much of society, especially white society, can look at Harris and perceive her as Black, and she will face discrimination as a result of that, regardless of which culture she might choose to identify with&nbsp;— and that has likely played a big role in how she views herself in the world.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris’s background represents a uniquely American melting pot story&nbsp;</h2>

<p>In her 2019 autobiography, <em>The Truths We Hold, </em>Harris wrote of how her Indian mother raised her with an appreciation for Indian culture, cooking her daughters Indian food, giving them Indian jewelry, and taking them on trips abroad to visit extended family. But Harris wrote that she was also keenly aware that the world would perceive her and her sister as Black women first and foremost: “My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.”</p>

<p>Harris also made choices that indicated she was leaning more into her Black identity over time: She attended Howard University, one of the country’s most prestigious historically Black colleges, and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/07/20/can-kamala-harris-secure-black-vote-help-her-sorority/1639638001/">joined a Black sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha</a>. Harris <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/09/16/kamala-harris-grew-up-mostly-white-world-then-she-went-black-university-black-city/?arc404=true">speaks fondly of her time at Howard</a> and often emphasizes her time there in response to critics who question her Black identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But that doesn’t mean that her Indian heritage isn’t part of her identity, either. Harris’s late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, has long been a <a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/02/10/kamala-harris-president-parents-shyamala-gopalan-donald-harris-berkeley/">prominent part of her story</a>. Gopalan, a breast cancer researcher who grew up in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, graduated from college at the age of 19 and immigrated to the Bay Area in 1959 to attend graduate school at the University of California Berkeley. There she met Donald Harris, a fellow graduate student who later became a professor of economics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The couple married and had two daughters; they divorced when Harris was 7 years old, and Harris and her sister were raised primarily by their mother. Gopalan was active in the civil rights movement in Berkeley in the 1960s and ’70s, marching in protests with her husband and sometimes bringing her daughters. It is the kind of family story that represents an increasingly multicultural, demographically diverse America: two immigrants from different countries who both came to the US to pursue higher education, who then raised two Black and South Asian daughters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it seems that for some, Harris’s uniquely American multiracial identity is less the utopian future we’re striving for and more a source of confusion — and sometimes even a justification for racism and suspicion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The real problem is America still doesn’t know how to treat multiracial people&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Pew Research estimates that <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2015/06/11/multiracial-in-america/">6.9 percent of the adult American population is multiracial</a>, and the Census Bureau predicts that the multiracial population in America will triple by 2060. But though this identity group is growing rapidly, many Americans still don’t know how to talk about multiracial people. Americans want to be able to easily label people by race and put them into one box.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harris herself told the Washington Post in 2019 that when she entered politics, she felt pressure to define herself. “When I first ran for office that was one of the things that I struggled with, which is that you are forced through that process to define yourself in a way that you fit neatly into the compartment that other people have created,” she told the Post. “My point was: I am who I am. I’m good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I’m fine with it,” she said.</p>

<p>Sanchez says that multiracial people can face what she refers to as double discrimination, where they experience discrimination from both communities they are members of. In Harris’s case, that leads to South Asians saying she’s not South Asian enough and Black people saying she might not be Black enough. “So there’s all these different sources of discrimination that are affecting the development of your multiracial identity and your experience with it, and that can make it hard to navigate,” Sanchez said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many South Asian Americans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/us/politics/kamala-harris-south-asians-indian.html">were excited</a> about <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-08-12/kamala-harris-vp-indian-americans">Harris’s historic nomination</a>. <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/kamala-harris-indian-american-identity-vp-pick.html">Pahwa wrote</a> for Slate that while he was conflicted about Harris’s political record, the moment was “undeniably a landmark moment for the South Asian diaspora. No matter how you spin it, it is progress, a bold assertion of the United States’ multiculturalism.”</p>

<p>But Harris has also faced detractors. <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/is-democratic-vice-president-nominee-kamala-harris-too-left-or-enough-indian/articleshow/77508151.cms">Indian media</a> has pondered the question of whether Harris is Indian enough, and<strong> </strong>she has simultaneously <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/12/kamala-harris-2020-black-race-1167030">been accused of not being “Black enough</a>.” In 2019, accusations <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/07/kamala-harris-not-black-ados-reparations-movement.html">swirled on Twitter</a> that Harris was not an “American Black” because her father was a Jamaican immigrant, rather than the descendant of enslaved people (these rumors later appeared to be the work of a coordinated bot campaign, but it was still retweeted by Donald Trump Jr. and spread briefly into the mainstream). Similar <a href="https://twitter.com/thomaschattwill/status/1293527111102324738?s=20">attacks</a> on <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-guest-says-kamala-harris-shouldnt-be-considered-african-american-because-she">Harris’s Blackness</a> <a href="https://reason.com/2020/08/11/is-kamala-harris-legally-african-american-indian-both-neither-or-something-else/?itm_source=parsely-api">began</a> anew after her VP nomination, with <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/some-questions-kamala-harris-about-eligibility-opinion-1524483">Newsweek </a>publishing an op-ed pushing birther-style questions about her citizenship and eligibility to be vice president, which a top <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/13/21366668/trump-campaign-birtherism-kamala-harris-born-in-oakland">Trump campaign adviser retweeted</a>.</p>

<p>In 2019, Harris described the accusations of not being Black enough as “hurtful” and “challenging,” <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kamala-harris-responds-birtherism_n_5d2dc4eae4b0a873f641bcef">telling journalist Jemele Hill</a>: “For other people who can’t figure out am I ‘black enough,’ I kinda feel like that’s their problem, not mine. Maybe they need to go back to school to figure it out. And maybe they need to learn about the African diaspora and maybe they need to learn about a number of other things.”</p>

Kamala Harris speaks at Howard University’s commencement ceremony in Washington, DC, on May 13, 2017. | Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post via Getty Images" />
<p>Carole Boyce-Davies, a professor of Africana studies at Cornell University, told Vox earlier this year that the pressure to choose an identity is something uniquely faced by Black Americans with immigrant families. “This is a good time for Americans to think through this question, and particularly since it’s not raised often in the context of white immigrant identities. [White immigrants] just pass and fade into white identities, and nobody knows what their background is.” The pressure to choose one identity over the other, Boyce-Davies said, is “often put on Black subjects, or subjects of color, where people feel you don’t have full allegiance to one identity when really we are all a complex set of identities.”</p>

<p>This is, unfortunately, a familiar situation for multiracial Americans. Over a decade ago, then-Sen. Barack Obama faced similar questions about whether he was “Black enough.” And Harris, who was then the San Francisco district attorney, spoke up in his defense in <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Obama-s-candidacy-sparks-debates-on-race-Is-he-2616419.php">a San Francisco Chronicle article in 2007</a>, saying: “The conversation highlights the lack of information that people in general have about African American contributions. … That is the added significance of Barack Obama. He is opening up what has been a limited perspective of who is an African American.”</p>

<p>Sanchez explained that multiracial people are often challenged on how they identify —&nbsp;and, as Obama and Harris have proven, will continue to be challenged. “You may choose an identity and people often feel the right to disagree with that,” she said. “There’s a lot of research on identity denial, where multiracial people uniquely encounter interactions where someone told them they can’t identify a certain way for various reasons,” she added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is perhaps why Harris has at times deflected questions about how she identifies, saying <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/i-am-who-i-am-kamala-harris-daughter-of-indian-and-jamaican-immigrants-defines-herself-simply-as-american/2019/02/02/0b278536-24b7-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html">during a 2019 campaign event</a>, “How do I describe myself? I describe myself as a proud American.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for South Asian Americans who wish that Harris highlighted her Indian heritage more, it’s worth asking why they might feel that way. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-47042681">South Asian communities</a> <a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/books/essay-on-kaala-a-film-on-racism-against-black-people-in-india/story-RhMGFmD5LtQyoInJdtSaXP.html">have their own</a> long history with <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/07/09/860912124/black-lives-matter-gets-indians-talking-about-skin-lightening-and-colorism">colorism</a> and <a href="https://www.dalitcamera.com/indian-racism-towards-black-people-is-almost-worse-than-white-peoples-racism/">anti-Black racism</a>. Lakshmi Sridaran, executive director of the nonprofit group South Asian Americans Leading Together (SAALT), suggested that Harris’s nomination should be seen as “an opportunity to look at the issue of anti-Black racism in our community.” Sridaran added: “The deeply seated anti-Black racism in the South Asian community is not often a welcoming place for anyone who identifies as Black. Confronting that racism should be the priority of the South Asian American community right now, especially given the current movement to expose and eliminate police violence.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris shouldn’t have to choose to be either Black or South Asian</h2>

<p>How Harris chooses to identify is ultimately a personal decision, and as a biracial person in America, that is undoubtedly an even more nuanced, complex issue for her to navigate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Ronald R. Sundstrom, author of <em>The Browning of America and the Evasion of Social Justice, </em><a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/22230854/kamala-harris-inauguration-mixed-race-biracial">wrote for Vox</a>,<em>&nbsp;“</em>Ultimately, it is a mixed person’s prerogative to be fluid in their identity, for them to sometimes hold one, or both, and for that to change over time.”</p>

<p>We’ve seen it before: When one person from a marginalized group breaks barriers and ascends to new heights, they shoulder the weight of their entire community’s expectations. When a woman runs for president, she is expected to represent all women; when a Black person runs for office, they’re under pressure to represent all Black people. And when a woman of color runs for office, let alone a multiracial woman who identifies with two major racial groups, she carries the burden of even more expectations on her shoulders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Harris is just one person, and she cannot be all things to all people. She doesn’t need to neatly fit into anybody’s box. And now, her barrier-breaking vice presidency is also a powerful win for representation of multiracial people in America.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kamala Harris has <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/what-to-know-in-washington-harris-sets-eyes-on-three-vp-picks/">reportedly narrowed</a> her list of potential running mates down to three: Minnesota Gov.

<p class="has-text-align-none">All these contenders have their upsides.

Plus, he’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/30/space-leaders-mark-kelly-00171814">been to space</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, a glance at the Electoral College map might lead one to believe that Shapiro is the obvious choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, Harris is polling a <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris">bit worse</a> in Pennsylvania than in the other key Rust Belt battlegrounds. The likely Democratic nominee trails Trump by 1.9 points there, while losing by only <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/michigan/trump-vs-harris">1 point in Michigan</a> and <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/wisconsin/trump-vs-harris">0.7 points in Wisconsin</a>, according to RealClearPolitics’s polling average. Close the gap in Pennsylvania, and Harris will be in striking distance of sweeping the three Midwestern swing states, which could be sufficient to win her the White House.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more, Pennsylvania holds four more Electoral College votes than Michigan and nine more than Wisconsin. As long as Democrats win Pennsylvania, they can lose both of those states and still&nbsp;retain some other plausible routes to victory. With Pennsylvania in her corner, Harris could lose Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin and still get just over 270 Electoral College votes by taking Georgia and Arizona.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given this math, it may seem like a no-brainer to pick the governor who boasts a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/josh-shapiro-kamala-harris-running-mate-questions/">60 percent</a> approval rating in the single most valuable battleground state.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there is one flaw in this reasoning: There is virtually no evidence that picking a vice presidential candidate from any particular state actually increases a party’s support in that state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shapiro might nonetheless be Harris’s best option. And it’s conceivable that he could marginally improve her support in Pennsylvania. But if he did, he’d be an exception to the rule. Harris would be well-advised to give more weight to other considerations when making her selection.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The weak, complicated case for believing that running mates help deliver their home states</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some research has found that vice presidential candidates do enjoy a “home-state advantage.” But these analyses generally rest on faulty premises.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, most studies suggested that presidential candidates do not enjoy any advantage in their running mate’s home state. In 2016, the political scientists Boris Heersink and Brenton Peterson published a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1532673X16642567?download=true&amp;journalCode=aprb">paper</a> that challenged this consensus.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conventionally, political scientists had gauged a running mate’s home-state advantage by considering 1) the national vote in a given election and 2) how a vice presidential candidate’s home state had voted on average in the five preceding elections.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With these two data points, they estimated how that state should have voted in a given election, considering its historical leanings and that year’s national environment, and then compared this estimate with how it actually voted. If a presidential candidate outperformed their expected share of the vote in their running mate’s home state, then one could plausibly conclude that they enjoyed an advantage there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Heersink and Peterson argue that there is one big problem with this reasoning: Political parties tend to choose vice presidential candidates from places where they are already losing ground due to structural political changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They highlight the example of John F. Kennedy’s selection of Lyndon Johnson in 1960.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the previous five elections, the Democratic Party’s support in LBJ’s home state of Texas had been in sharp decline, as Republicans steadily ate into the New Deal coalition. In 1940, Franklin Delano Roosevelt won 81 percent of the state’s votes; four years later, he took 71 percent. With those two landslides propping up the Democratic Party’s average historical support in Texas, Kennedy was all but certain to do worse than expected in the Lone Star State, no matter whom he chose as his running mate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The traditional formula for calculating home-state advantage missed this fact. Instead, it suggested that choosing LBJ actually reduced Kennedy’s support in Texas by 15 points.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Heersink and Peterson found this implausible. They insisted that a vice presidential candidate’s home state is much more likely to be trending away from that candidate’s party than the nation as a whole. Therefore, to capture a running mate’s true home-state advantage, you need to compare their home state’s voting behavior with that of the same exact state in an alternate dimension with a different vice presidential nominee who came from somewhere else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lacking the budget for interdimensional travel, the researchers settled for the next best thing. By cobbling together bits and pieces of other US states, they created a “synthetic” Texas: A group of geographic areas that had collectively voted the same way that Texas had in 1952 and 1956. Comparing 1960’s election results in this Frankensteinian pseudo-Texas to actual Texas, they found that LBJ’s selection likely increased Kennedy’s margin in the Lone Star State.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Applying this method to all US elections between 1844 and 2012, they found that vice presidential candidates boosted their ticket’s support in their home states by an average of 2.67 percent — more than enough to potentially swing the result of an election.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why picking Josh Shapiro might not help Harris much in Pennsylvania</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Heersink and Peterson’s findings are correct, then a ton of Democratic and Republican consultants need to get fired.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent elections, neither party’s presidential nominee has chosen a running mate from the most hotly contested swing state. They’ve tended to pick politicians from completely uncompetitive states: George W. Bush picked Dick Cheney from deep red Wyoming, Obama tapped Biden from safe blue Delaware, Trump selected Mike Pence from solidly Republican (<a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/charlie-mahtesian/2012/05/indiana-the-obama-state-that-got-away-123907">except for immediately after a financial crash</a>) Indiana, and Biden chose Harris from the coastal Gomorrah of California.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If all of these nominees could have bought themselves a significant boost in a pivotal swing state simply by choosing a different running mate, then their top advisers should never work in politics again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The thing is, there is reason to think that Heersink and Peterson’s paper is wrong.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2019, the political scientists Christopher J. Devine and Kyle Kopko <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psq.12610">published a study</a> that reaffirmed the original conventional wisdom: Running mates don’t meaningfully increase a ticket’s support in their home states.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Devine and Kopko’s research directly rebuts Heersink and Peterson’s, noting two major flaws: First, its core premise — that parties tend to pick vice presidential candidates from states where they’re losing ground — is not true and was based on a technical error in their research.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1948, a faction of southern Democrats split with the national party in protest of President Harry Truman’s embrace of civil rights. These Dixiecrats put forward their own, alternative Democratic nominee, South Carolina Gov. Strom Thurmond. Alabama chose to leave Truman off of the state’s ballot and listed Thurmond as the Democratic presidential nominee in his stead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a result, the Democratic Party’s actual nominee won no votes in Alabama that year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Heersink and Peterson code this as a 100-point Republican victory in Alabama, since they don’t recognize Thurmond as the Democratic nominee. And this dubious decision matters for the rest of their paper since, in 1952, the Democrats’ vice presidential candidate was from Alabama. In fact, the idea that parties generally pick VP nominees from places where they’re losing ground is based entirely on the alleged fact that 1952 Democratic standard-bearer Adlai Stevenson picked a running mate from a state that his party had lost by 100 points four years earlier. Take that result out of Heersink and Peterson’s averages and the trend completely disappears.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second problem with their paper is that its results are based entirely on the voting behavior of geographic areas rather than people. Data on shifts in a region’s aggregate political leanings have their uses, but information about individuals’ voting preferences is generally better for gauging the influence of any given factor on election outcomes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is partly because the population of an area can change between election cycles. For example, a state can gradually lose college-educated voters if other areas offer better job opportunities for young professionals. Thus, if you compare a state’s voting behavior in one election to its behavior in a later one, you might mistake the impact of a demographic shift for the impact of a specific campaign decision, such as the selection of a running mate from that state.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Using large-scale survey data on individuals from all 50 states, Devine and Kopko are able to gauge the impact of running mate decisions on voters. They find that, after controlling for all other relevant variables (e.g., partisanship, race, age, gender, income, etc.), voters from the same state as a party’s vice presidential nominee are no more likely to support that party than voters from other states. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This finding does not prove that Heersink and Peterson’s paper was entirely wrong. Although some of that study’s criticisms of the conventional formula for assessing home-state advantage were faulty, others were apt. Specifically, Heersink and Peterson correctly noted that gauging a state’s partisanship using the previous <em>five</em> elections was liable to throw off estimates of “expected” vote share, since party coalitions can flip dramatically in the space of 20 years.<br><br>Further, Devine and Kopko did not demonstrate that there was any technical error or absurd conceptual premise in Heersink and Peterson’s approach to measuring home-state advantage. But the former’s work did show that the latter’s findings are inconsistent with individual-level survey data. And it is probably safer to make causal inferences from such data than it is to do so using state-level figures. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Shapiro might be the right choice, but Harris shouldn’t pick him for the wrong reasons</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this necessarily means that Harris shouldn’t pick Shapiro.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Pennsylvania governor does have some liabilities. His <a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/07/30/picking-josh-shapiro-could-be-for-harris--heres-why/">unusually strident</a> criticisms of pro-Palestinian protesters have earned him the enmity of some progressives, while the uncanny similarity between his <a href="https://x.com/ArmandDoma/status/1818068587627823407">oratorical style and Barack Obama’s</a> could be offputting to some voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, by picking Shapiro, Harris could plausibly counter the widespread perception that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/23/2024/the-upside-for-harris-is-huge-democratic-poll-finds-kamala-needs-to-define-her-brand-quickly">she is very left-wing</a>, which may be a source of concern for some swing voters. And the qualities that have enabled the Pennsylvania governor to earn a 60 percent approval rating in his home state might help him win the confidence of a national electorate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also remains conceivable that Shapiro could help Harris a bit in Pennsylvania. The empirical evidence may strongly suggest that a running mate’s home state doesn’t matter, but there are no infallible measurement tools in social science. Survey data can be biased, and not at all relevant variables can be identified and controlled. More critically, as noted above, it’s been decades since the nominee of either party actually tried putting the popular incumbent governor of a hotly contested swing state on the ticket. So the historical data might not be a reliable guide to the implications of picking Shapiro.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also some reasons to think that Harris’s VP pick will matter more than most: In some <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/harris-sees-boost-favorability-after-biden-drops-race/story?id=112306763">recent polls</a>, Harris’s favorability has jumped dramatically in recent weeks, a development that suggests voters’ impressions of her are unusually unsettled. Since her choice of running mate will be the first major decision she makes as presumptive Democratic nominee, it could solidify many voters’ views of her candidacy. Shapiro’s selection could plausibly reassure some Pennsylvania swing voters that Harris is the type of Democrat they can trust.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Harris should not count on that. Although it is possible that Shapiro could help her win Pennsylvania, the historical record indicates that this is far from a sure thing.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For that reason, if Harris believes that Walz or Kelly would play better to a national audience, she should not pick Shapiro merely because he’s from a more valuable state.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On Wednesday, President-elect Donald Trump revealed he will nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), an <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/384967/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general">accused sex offender known for his firm loyalty to Trump</a>, to lead the Department of Justice. (Gaetz has denied wrongdoing.) On Thursday evening, Trump announced that three other lawyers he has close personal ties to will also be nominated to top DOJ jobs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This means that four of the highest jobs in the Justice Department, the office that brings federal prosecutions, will be held by people whose records suggest they will advance Trump’s personal interest. Three of these four lawyers have serious legal credentials and institutional knowledge, and thus are likely to be effective in advancing those interests.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/14/us/politics/todd-blanche-deputy-attorney-general-trump.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">chose Todd Blanche</a>, the criminal defense lawyer in his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24126338/trump-new-york-trial-stormy-daniels">New York hush money trial</a> (the one where he faced charges related to money paid to keep a sexual encounter quiet), to be deputy attorney general. That’s the No. 2 job in the Justice Department. The DAG, as this position is known within the department, wields tremendous power over federal criminal prosecutions. If successfully appointed, Blanche will <a href="https://www.justice.gov/doj/office-deputy-attorney-general#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20ODAG,organizational%20units%20of%20the%20Department.">supervise the 93 regional US attorneys</a> who bring the bulk of all federal prosecutions in the United States. So Blanche will have a great deal of authority over who is prosecuted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Trump wants <a href="https://x.com/kleavittnh/status/1857199006146822425">John Sauer</a>, the lawyer who represented him in the Supreme Court case holding that Trump is allowed to use the <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">powers of the president to commit crimes</a>, to serve as solicitor general. The role <a href="https://www.justice.gov/osg/about-office">oversees the Justice Department’s legal strategy in the Supreme Court</a>, including arguing many of the most important cases. They also decide which cases the DOJ will appeal if the federal government loses a case in a trial court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another one of Trump’s personal criminal defense lawyers, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/14/trump-todd-blanche-deputy-attorney-general">Emil Bove</a>, will serve as principal associate deputy attorney general, and will hold the DAG spot on an acting basis until Blanche or some other Trump nominee is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet">confirmed or otherwise formally appointed to the job</a>. Unlike the DAG and the solicitor general, Bove’s new role <a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/11/14/trump-picks-legal-defense-team-for-top-justice-department-roles/">does not require Senate confirmation</a>. So he will be able to move into this job on the first day of Trump’s second presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t the first time a president has tried to put one of his personal lawyers in a position of high responsibility within government. President Lyndon Johnson, for example, <a href="https://thinkwy.org/columns/justice-abe-fortas-life-as-a-lawyers-lawyer-and-a-greek-tragedy/">named Abe Fortas</a>, his friend and personal lawyer, to the Supreme Court in 1965. If you know anything about Fortas’s very brief tenure on the Court, you may know that <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/cautionary-tale-abe-fortas">appointment didn’t end well</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Based strictly on their résumés, all three men are conventionally qualified for these jobs. Both <a href="https://04q.7c7.myftpupload.com/betsy-wright-2/">Blanche</a> and <a href="https://blanchelaw.com/emil-bove/">Bove</a> previously worked as federal prosecutors for nine years before entering private practice. Sauer is a former law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia who <a href="https://fedsoc.org/contributors/d-john-sauer">previously served Missouri’s solicitor general</a>. It’s easy to see all three joining the Justice Department without much controversy if they were picked by, say, President Nikki Haley.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump talks often about using the DOJ to target his political adversaries and people he views as foes. An NPR report on October 22 found that Trump “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">made more than 100 threats to prosecute or punish perceived enemies</a>.” That includes a threat to, in Trump’s words, “appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also accused former Rep. Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic of the incoming president, of “TREASON” and threatened “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">TELEVISED MILITARY TRIBUNALS</a>.” (Which, if they were to actually happen, would presumably take place in the Defense Department’s legal structure, but could involve some DOJ personnel.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s decision to name Gaetz, a staunch loyalist, to lead the Justice Department is a <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/384967/matt-gaetz-donald-trump-attorney-general">cause for considerable alarm</a> if you fear the United States sliding into authoritarianism. Historically, the White House has <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/383152/donald-trump-criminal-indictments-supreme-court-reelected">obeyed strong norms</a> against interfering with Justice Department prosecutorial decisions, but these norms have no legal force. So someone like Gaetz could tear down this barrier altogether.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s decision to appoint his personal lawyers to top DOJ jobs is equally concerning. Federal lawyers are supposed to represent the interests of the United States, not of any particular politician, while they work for the government. But Trump has selected three people who aren’t simply accustomed to representing his personal interests, but who have also likely collected considerable legal fees from him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blanche, Sauer, and Bove’s conventional résumés also mean that, if they use their DOJ posts to pursue Trump’s personal campaign of vengeance, they are likely to be fairly effective in doing so. As a DOJ outsider known for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/gaetz-coronavirus-gas-mask/index.html">performative political stunts</a>, Gaetz may struggle to navigate the department’s internal bureaucracy or to resist its internal culture, which seeks to <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/383152/donald-trump-criminal-indictments-supreme-court-reelected">insulate prosecutorial decisions from the White House</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blanche, Sauer, and Gaetz still need to be confirmed — assuming that Trump doesn’t <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet">use recess appointments</a> or some other method to get around the Senate confirmation process. But if Trump gets his way, his ultraloyalist attorney general will now be backed by people who know the Justice Department and the culture of elite federal lawyers quite well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the aftermath of Donald Trump’s presidential victory, journalists and analysts have rushed to diagnose the causes of Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217;s defeat and the Democratic Party’s broader losses. One of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383897/harris-lost-debate-why-trump-won">emerging theories</a> is that voters felt Democrats had drifted far from mainstream concerns by focusing too much on culture issues — particularly transgender rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The GOP <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/380861/trump-transphobic-anti-trans-ads-scapegoating">weaponized transgender rights</a> on the campaign trail, pouring <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/rep-elect-sarah-mcbride-ready-push-back-second-trump-administration-rcna178980">over $200 million</a> into ads this cycle that painted Harris as out of step. “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,” blared one ad that launched in September. At rallies, Trump stoked fears with <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-politics-and-policy/trump-false-claims-schools-transgender-surgeries-rcna170217">lies about gender-affirming surgery</a> in schools, while <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4936727-trump-bans-transgender-athletes/">promising to ban</a> transgender women from sports.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html">Trump campaign maintains</a> that their anti-trans ads resonated not only with Black and Latino men but also with moderate suburban white women concerned about school sports. <a href="https://www.galvanizeaction.org/">Galvanize Action</a>, a progressive organization focused on mobilizing moderate white women, did find that 53 percent of respondents <a href="https://oneforallcommittee.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/September-2024-Tracking-Survey-Wave-5-2.pdf">on their most recent September survey</a> believed people advocating for the rights of transgender people “have gone too far.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After the election, some Democrats echoed the concern. “I don’t want to discriminate against anybody, but I don’t think biological boys should be playing in girls’ sports,” Rep. Tom Suozzi, a New York moderate, said in an interview <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/democrats-house-ny.html">with the New York Times</a>. “Democrats aren’t saying that, and they should be.” Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts made <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/seth-moulton-trans-athletes-democrats/">similar remarks</a>: “I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on the field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat, I’m supposed to be afraid to say that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Franklin Foer, a journalist for the Atlantic and author of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534055/the-last-politician-by-franklin-foer/">a book on Joe Biden’s presidency</a> titled <em>The Last Politician</em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534055/the-last-politician-by-franklin-foer/">,</a> reported last week that some members of Biden’s inner circle were dissatisfied with Harris’s defense against right-wing accusations that she supported the most extreme version of transgender rights, including gender-affirming surgery for prisoners. Biden’s allies <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/biden-harris-2024-election/680560/?gift=8ABnGgCURdeDIfG_FJbid6Ip6RYlWossbV4QrslCDmk&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social">claimed</a> the president “never would have let such attacks stand” and would have “clearly rejected the idea of trans women competing in women’s sports.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it will take time to fully understand why voters cast their ballots as they did, one thing is already clear: Neither Harris nor<em> </em>Biden made any effort to talk about what the Biden administration <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/fact-sheet-us-department-of-educations-proposed-change-its-title-ix">actually proposed</a> to do on school sports.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What the Biden administration proposed on transgender athletes</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2023, over strong objections of activists on the right and left, the Biden administration announced a <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/04/13/2023-07601/nondiscrimination-on-the-basis-of-sex-in-education-programs-or-activities-receiving-federal">proposed change</a> to Title IX, the law that prohibits discrimination based on sex in any federally funded educational program. Their suggested change would prohibit outright bans on transgender athletes, but would permit schools to restrict transgender students from participating if they could demonstrate that inclusion would harm “educational objectives” like fair competition and the prevention of injury.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This more nuanced stance marked the first time the Biden administration took the position that sex differences can matter in school sports, something hotly disputed by leading LGBTQ rights organizations. The proposed rule also reflected <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28397355/">research</a> that suggests sex differences emerge over time, so the standard for inclusion in high school should not necessarily be the same as that in younger grades.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Contrary to the post-election grumblings from Biden allies in the Atlantic, the president has been virtually silent on his own administration’s proposal for the last 18 months. He’s never spoken about it, and it was never mentioned by any other Biden official, including in <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/?s=transgender">any White House briefing</a> on transgender issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The White House declined to comment for this story. A spokesperson for the Department of Education said their rulemaking process is still ongoing, as they consider <a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/fact-sheet-us-department-of-educations-proposed-change-its-title-ix?utm_content=&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_source=govdelivery&amp;utm_term=">the 150,000 public comments</a> they received. “We do not have information to share today on a timeline,” they added. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In polling, voters consistently ranked transgender rights <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651719/economy-important-issue-2024-presidential-vote.aspx">as a very low priority</a> compared to other issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there is some evidence that Republicans&#8217; years of attacks have taken their toll on public opinion. Gallup <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/507023/say-birth-gender-dictate-sports-participation.aspx">found in 2023</a> that 69 percent of Americans believe transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that match their sex assigned at birth, an increase from the 62 percent who said the same in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tellingly, Biden&#8217;s proposed policy on transgender athletes — allowing targeted restrictions for fairness and safety while rejecting blanket bans — would likely resonate more with average Americans than the hardline stances typically associated with Republicans, who leaned on transgender fearmongering in the midterms <a href="https://www.thirdway.org/memo/gop-attacks-on-transgender-kids-fell-flat">only to see their candidates flop</a>, or Democrats, who many voters perceive as having no nuance on the topic at all. Yet the Biden administration&#8217;s reluctance to clearly communicate their middle-ground position left a vacuum that Republicans were happy to fill. It&#8217;s a dynamic that political observers say has become increasingly common: Democratic leaders stake out a position but, wary of internal rifts, default to strategic ambiguity even on issues where their stances might resonate with voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The White House could have said something in the election, they could have said Democrats want rules too,” said Lanae Erickson, the senior vice president for social policy at Third Way, a centrist think tank.&nbsp;“The number one big <a href="https://www.thirdway.org/memo/talking-about-transgender-youth-in-sports">messaging advice from 2022 we had</a> is that Democrats want sports to be fair and athletes to be safe.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Biden administration’s proposed school sports rule in 2023 marked a shift from its first two years</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden has long stood out for his support of transgender rights. In 2012, as vice president, <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/politico44/2012/10/biden-says-transgender-discrimination-civil-rights-issue-of-our-time-147761">he called it</a> “the civil rights issue of our time,” something <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1221135646107955200">he reiterated again</a> while campaigning for his own presidential run in 2020. He named passing <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/969591569/house-to-vote-on-equality-act-heres-what-the-law-would-do">the Equality Act, an LGBTQ anti-discrimination bill, a top legislative priority</a>, and on his first day in office issued a sweeping executive order that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2021/01/21/biden-executive-order-transgender-lgbtq/">called on all federal agencies to review</a> their rules to ensure that any sex discrimination protection includes sexual orientation and gender identity, too.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the Biden administration prioritized LGBTQ rights, social conservatives were in the midst of shifting their focus to new cultural battles following their decisive losses on marriage for same-sex couples both at the Supreme Court in 2015 <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/findings-from-the-2022-american-values-atlas">and in the court of public opinion</a>. Right-wing activists did not hide that they were searching for a new galvanizing cause to rally donors and grassroots voters. “We threw everything at the wall,” Terry Schilling, the president of American Principles Project, a social conservative advocacy group, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/16/us/politics/transgender-conservative-campaign.html">told the New York Times</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"> While their early efforts to focus on bathroom <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/11/11655888/daily-show-north-carolina-bathrooms">bans backfired</a>, Schilling’s group discovered in 2019 that focusing on school sports bans appeared much more effective, even though the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6803a3.htm">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had found</a> just 1.8 percent of high school students even identified as transgender.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Idaho became the first state to ban transgender girls from school sports and within four years, <a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/youth/sports_participation_bans">half of all states</a> had passed similar laws, as well as laws banning gender-affirming health care. “It happened super fast. It came out of nowhere,” said Erickson of Third Way. “People weren’t prepared to deal with it because it wasn’t on the radar.”<br><br>“Athletes proved potent for them because there’s always winners and losers in sports,” added Gillian Branstetter, a communications strategist with the American Civil Liberties Union. “And that’s not a particularly new tool for the right.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In terms of policy, the Biden administration initially staked out a position that said there’s no legitimate basis to discriminate based on sex differences. In 2021, Biden’s Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1405541/dl?inline">intervened in a lawsuit</a> filed by parents of an 11-year-old transgender girl against the state of West Virginia, affirming this view.<br><br>“[West Virginia] cannot point to any valid evidence that allowing transgender girls to participate on girls’ sports teams endangers girls’ athletic opportunities,” the department said in its filing. “Instead, the State legislated based on misconceptions and overbroad assumptions about transgender girls.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While praised by major LGBTQ groups like the Human Rights Campaign, this position obscured quieter disagreement among transgender leaders. Some questioned whether sports participation should be a top priority for the movement, while others doubted whether litigation was the best approach for advancing inclusion, given the state of public opinion. The Justice Department’s position also masked divides within the Democratic Party. Though it’s a complex topic and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/23/world/europe/paris-olympics-transgender-athletes.html">more research is needed</a>, some existing <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/11/577">scientific</a> <a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/55/15/865">evidence</a> suggests that transgender girls and women who do not suppress testosterone can have advantages in sports, particularly if they have gone through male puberty.<br><br>The West Virginia lawsuit wasn’t the only federal suit in the works. Happening at the same time was another case involving two transgender girls that was quickly drawing national <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/14/us/transgender-athletes-connecticut-lawsuit/index.html">attention</a>. In response to <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/transgender-teens-outrun-track-field-competitors-critics-close/story?id=55856294">Terry Miller</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2019/feb/24/terry-miller-andraya-yearwood-transgender-sprinter/">Andraya Yearwood</a> winning multiple state track titles in Connecticut, competitors&#8217; parents and the Christian right-wing legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom <a href="https://adflegal.blob.core.windows.net/mainsite-new/docs/default-source/documents/legal-documents/selina-soule---title-ix-complaint/selina-soule---title-ix-complaint---complaint-filed-with-u-s-doe-office-for-civil-rights-(2019-06-17).pdf?sfvrsn=4e2231c5_4">filed</a> a lawsuit against Connecticut’s policy of including transgender athletes. Though initially dismissed in 2021, a federal judge just this month <a href="https://www.ctpost.com/news/article/ct-transgender-high-school-athletes-lawsuit-19896739.php">said the Title IX case could proceed</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As more of these politically charged lawsuits and bills mounted, the Biden administration announced it would be delaying its proposed changes to Title IX, despite its Day 1 executive order. Sources involved said the delay was largely understood as a political move <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/10/10/democrats-arent-eager-to-talk-about-transgender-athletes-the-gop-cant-get-enough-00060931">driven by the upcoming midterm elections</a>. When the Education Department finally released its proposed school sports rule in 2023, its language represented more of a compromise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rule marked the Biden administration’s first time saying that sex differences can matter in school sports and schools can discriminate in some cases, while also saying schools do not have to — thus permitting blue states like Connecticut to continue with existing policy. While its <a href="https://x.com/AOC/status/1644123142015660032">merits were debated</a>, the federal proposal was on the table.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The draft regulation recognizes that there are real sex differences and that these matter in competition,” <a href="https://law.duke.edu/fac/colemand">Doriane Coleman</a>, a law professor at Duke University who focuses on sports and gender, told Vox. “For the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which takes the position that all sex differences are just myth and stereotype, that was a big, maybe even treasonous move.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden, Harris, and the Democratic Party never talked about the school sports rule after it was proposed</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even as <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/25/2023/the-republican-race-to-the-right-on-transgender-issues-is-speeding-up">conservatives barraged Democrats with attacks</a> that they were extremists on school sports, the White House and then later the Harris campaign never sought to talk about the direction they thought Title IX policy ought to go.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sources with close knowledge of the White House’s thinking, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Vox the administration worried that talking about the rule would have unintended consequences for transgender individuals already facing threats, and they didn’t want to give political fodder for Republicans to twist their words. So they said nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some progressive communications strategists <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/political-commentary/harris-trump-democrats-republicans-anti-trans-bullying-1235136920/">warned against</a> generally staying silent on transgender rights.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wemakethefutureaction.us/">We Make the Future Action</a> and <a href="https://asocommunications.com/">ASO Communication</a> tested different strategies and found messaging that didn&#8217;t directly reference transgender people tended to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-n7e_1L4WFM6-rLf4A-uYbovrYMH9CmUkAVs4Km0lYk/edit?tab=t.0">weaken support for progressive positions</a> among certain voter groups who were otherwise confronted with anti-trans ads. Or, put differently, saying nothing could hurt more than saying something proactive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When Democrats are silent about race or immigrants or trans people, all that conflicted voters hear are the siren songs of hate peddling from Republicans about said ‘other,’” Anat Shenker-Osorio, who led the messaging research, told Vox. “Ignoring doesn’t make the attack go away. It makes it all that voters hear about the topic.”<br><br>Erickson agreed with this critique. In addition to not wanting to get yelled at by progressive leaders on X, she said, Democrats believed they should avoid talking about transgender rights to change the subject. “I think that is so idiotic, especially when the issue is high-salience,” she stressed, emphasizing that leaders <a href="https://www.thirdway.org/memo/talking-about-transgender-youth-in-sports">could have focused on shared values</a> of freedom, dignity, and privacy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mara Keisling, a longtime transgender advocate and founding director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, told Vox she wasn’t bothered that Harris hadn’t focused on trans people on the campaign trail and that it’s understandable Harris would prioritize issues that mattered to all voters. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s more important to me who won the election than whether or not trans people are mentioned,” Keisling said. On the question of where the Biden administration was headed on school sports participation, Kiesling said she just didn’t think people would care about the process of an Education Department rule. “They used to say in politics that if you’re talking about process, you’re losing,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Branstetter emphasized that it’s not as if national Democrats didn’t have good models to emulate when it comes to messaging, noting that red-state Democrats like those in Arkansas, Kansas, and Oklahoma <a href="https://kansasreflector.com/2023/02/13/kansas-democrats-describe-attempt-to-ban-transgender-student-athletes-as-crushing-weight/">have demonstrated</a> clearly over the last half-decade how to stand up to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23631262/trans-bills-republican-state-legislatures">anti-trans legislative attacks</a>. “Democrats are overestimating the electoral potency and letting themselves get lost in the issue instead of framing the opposition’s attacks within the broader fight for equality,” she said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moving forward, a series of federal lawsuits — including the aforementioned Connecticut case and <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/385198/supreme-court-transgender-united-states-skrmetti" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/scotus/385198/supreme-court-transgender-united-states-skrmetti">one the Supreme Court</a> is set to <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/10/supreme-court-schedules-transgender-rights-case-for-december/">hear in December</a> — could affect how rules, laws, and guidelines on issues of transgender rights develop. The NCAA is also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/12/sport/naia-ncaa-transgender-ban-sports/index.html">currently reviewing its own policies</a> for transgender athletes at the college level. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the Supreme Court’s ruling earlier this year in <em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em>, federal agencies may have far less leeway to make policy decisions of all kinds without Congress getting involved. My colleague Ian Millhiser <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">called the ruling</a> a “radical reordering of the US separation of powers” and “likely to be one of [the Court’s] most consequential modern-day decisions.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Coleman, of Duke Law, thinks the <em>Loper Bright </em>decision and broader changes in administrative law will mean the school sports issue ultimately gets decided legislatively, not in the courts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until then, though, the matter will likely continue to play out in politics. Democrats may be well-intentioned in seeking to avoid heated and sensitive issues, but their strategy of silence can fuel the perception that the party cannot craft politically viable solutions, and more importantly, contribute to the myth that there’s a major ongoing crisis in school sports.<br><br>“There aren’t trans athletes everywhere beating women,” Keisling said. “There are a lot of 6-year-olds and 10-year-olds who just want to play soccer with their friends.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> announced Thursday that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/368394/rfk-drop-out-2024-presidential-campaign-trump">Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> would be <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1857170020427595797">his nominee</a> to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), setting the stage for a potentially radical remaking of the nation’s health care. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy’s nomination was not a surprise. Last month, Kennedy said Trump had <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/10/30/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trump-administration-00186227">promised him control of the department</a> and its many subagencies, which include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), and others. Trump himself <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/-trump-says-he-would-let-anti-vaccine-advocate-rfk-jr-go-wild-on-health-222810181633">pledged</a> during the campaign to let Kennedy “go wild on health.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s a perplexing pick. Kennedy has spent <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-distorted-vaccine-science1/">decades</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-2ccde2df146f57b5e8c26e8494f0a16a">spreading anti-vaccination pseudoscience</a>, and the organization he leads, Children&#8217;s Health Defense, has been one of the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-pandemics-race-and-ethnicity-d140be878b1ef0c5a5cce3cfde71e69c">foremost anti-vaccine advocacy groups</a> in the US and abroad. His work in support of a Samoan anti-vaccine group helped fuel a wave of vaccine hesitancy in the island nation, leading to a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-kennedy-election-vaccines-8b7b8506aec638b26c30a42819d96036">2019 measles epidemic</a> that killed 83 people, most of them children.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s expressed a range of other conspiracy-laden ideas about health: He says fluoride is industrial waste linked to a range of diseases, and suggested it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/health/rfk-jr-fluoride-science/index.html">should be removed</a> from all US water systems. He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/us/politics/rfk-conspiracy-theories-fact-check.html">speculated</a> that gender dysphoria may result from herbicide exposure and implied mass shootings are linked to antidepressants.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy does hold other views that align with many scientists: He <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-robert-f-kennedy-make-america-healthy-again/">traces</a> America’s high levels of chronic disease to the widespread availability of highly processed, non-nutritious food, which he and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379713003206">nutrition policy experts</a> blame in part on broken agriculture policy. He’s railed against <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/us/politics/robert-kennedy-jr-donald-trump-health-care.html">corruption and conflicts of interest</a> in the FDA’s drug approval process that favor big pharmaceutical companies over the interests of individuals — something <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2002-09-15/get-the-fda-out-of-the-way-and-drug-prices-will-drop?embedded-checkout=true">economists</a>, <a href="https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2022/11/09/book-review-drugs-and-the-fda-safety-efficacy-and-the-publics-trust-by-mikkael-a-sekeres/">scientists</a>, and <a href="https://www.pogo.org/investigations/in-fda-meetings-voice-of-patient-often-funded-by-drug-companies">consumer advocates</a> agree on.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No matter where a person stands on the political spectrum, they can probably find something to agree with Kennedy on<em>. </em>He is the personification of <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/11/14/americans-trust-in-scientists-positive-views-of-science-continue-to-decline/">the growing distrust of science and “the public health establishment”</a> that many Americans have felt in the post-pandemic era.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">HHS secretaries are usually seasoned bureaucrats with a lot of experience moving policy through government agencies — a state insurance commissioner in Barack Obama’s case or a tenured pharma executive in Donald Trump’s first term. They typically understand how science is done and what it means for a health intervention to be grounded in evidence. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy doesn’t have that résumé —&nbsp;far from it. Now he’ll be in charge of much of US health care, which raises the question: How much damage can he actually do in this role?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer will depend on a few things. First, he has to be confirmed by the Senate (unless the White House attempts to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet">circumvent</a> that chamber’s constitutional “advise and consent” powers) and Republicans have only a narrow majority. Even if Kennedy is confirmed, Trump has other important health care appointments to make — particularly for CMS, NIH, FDA, and CDC — and those people will hold sway over the administration’s health care agenda too. They could be in the Kennedy vein or, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/11/15/battle-lines-what-do-trumps-appointments-tell-us-about-his/">as we have seen with Trump’s foreign policy picks</a>, a mix of the conventional and the iconoclastic. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, however, Kennedy’s appointment is a watershed moment that could portend enormous changes to the American health system. Republicans in Congress will control the HHS budget, and Kennedy, if confirmed, could have broad discretion to pursue his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda with Trump’s blessing. If the Trump administration attempts to remove civil servants across the government, including the health agencies, decades of public health knowledge could be lost at the CDC, FDA, and elsewhere. It is uncertain if the Republican-dominated judiciary would step in to stop any of it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what we know about the Trump health department’s plans — and what hurdles may await them.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What RFK Jr. can — and can’t — do on vaccines, briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last 30 years, vaccines have saved the lives of more than <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/vaccines-children-saved">1.1 million children </a><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7333e1.htm?_cid=mm7333e1_w">in the US alone</a>. Over the same period, they’ve also <a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/childhood-vaccines-have-prevented-half-billion-illnesses-saved-us-27-trillion-3#:~:text=The%20investigators%20found%20that%2C%20among,%242.7%20trillion%20in%20societal%20costs.">saved</a> Americans $540 billion in direct health care costs and trillions in social costs. Routine vaccines protect American children from 16 diseases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump himself <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/366472/2024-election-donald-trump-vaccines-schools">suggested</a> blocking funding for local schools with vaccine requirements during the campaign, though the federal government has limited authority to do so. Despite Kennedy’s long history of anti-vaccine rhetoric, he said in early November he wasn&#8217;t planning to take anyone&#8217;s vaccines away. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People ought to have choice, and that choice ought to be informed by the best information,&#8221; Kennedy said in an <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-win-rfk-jr-says-wont-take-away-anybodys-vaccines-rcna178955">NBC News interview</a>. &#8220;So I’m going to make sure scientific safety studies and efficacy are out there, and people can make individual assessments about whether that product is going to be good for them.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, a co-chair of Trump’s transition team recently said Kennedy hoped to access federal health data with the goal of proving vaccines are unsafe and <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-10-31/rfk-jr-wants-federal-health-data-so-he-can-show-vaccines-are-unsafe-trump-transition-co-chair-says">pulling them from the US market</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That&#8217;s not as easy to do as it sounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Undoing the approval of an already approved vaccine would <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-314/subpart-D/section-314.150">require</a> submitting evidence of harm that meets the FDA’s standards to prove harm, which simply <a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/english/safety-prevention/immunizations/pages/vaccine-studies-examine-the-evidence.aspx">doesn&#8217;t exist</a>. Although a Trump-installed loyalist could theoretically rewrite the FDA’s standards, that would likely lead to opposition from the pharmaceutical companies that produce these vaccines. There would be a wave of expensive and prolonged lawsuits for the federal government.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Drugmakers also wield influence in Congress, which writes the law that sets pharmaceutical industry fees that cover nearly <a href="https://today.uconn.edu/2021/05/why-is-the-fda-funded-in-part-by-the-companies-it-regulates-2/#">half of the FDA’s budget</a>. That law will need to be reauthorized before the end of Trump’s term, setting up a potentially vicious fight if the two sides are at odds over vaccines. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is a more realistic move Kennedy could take to address his concern about vaccine side effects: He could resuscitate the National Vaccine Program Office, which monitored vaccine safety with particular rigor but was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/health/covid-vaccine-safety.html">shuttered</a> under the first Trump presidency.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although it would be difficult to pull vaccines from the American market, and Kennedy says he won’t, there are other ways he could exert influence to reduce vaccine uptake.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy could try to influence the CDC. That agency has two important roles in promoting vaccines in the US: It convenes an Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to provide expert recommendations on who should get which vaccines and at what age, and it administers the Vaccines for Children program, which provides free vaccines for children in low-income families. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The advisory committee is not mandated by federal law — it is convened only if the CDC wants it to be. A vaccine skeptic appointed to run the CDC under Kennedy could either staff the committee with anti-vaccination activists or dissolve it entirely. That would mean the agency would no longer provide widely accepted guidelines for vaccination that state health departments and hundreds of thousands of clinicians nationwide now rely on.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Vaccines for Children program is funded by a pot of money that Congress sets aside for the CDC every year. Kennedy could press Congress and the White House to simply cut that funding, ending the program entirely. That would leave low-income families having to pay out of pocket to vaccinate their children.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy will also be ultimately responsible for two giant public insurance programs: Medicare, which covers seniors, and Medicaid, which is overseen by the states and covers low-income people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In both programs, the amount of money disbursed by the federal government is in part determined by how good of a job the states and private insurers do in vaccinating children and older adults enrolled in these programs. Kennedy could pressure the CMS administrator to eliminate that vaccination requirement, one reason Trump’s choice at CMS will be one to watch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear what the timeline would be to accomplish any of these tasks; there’s no precedent for a president and HHS secretary who are so openly hostile to US public health infrastructure assuming control of it. Even if it takes a while, there’s widespread concern that giving such a platform to someone who denies vaccine science could further degrade public trust not only in the vaccines, but in the many other health recommendations and interventions that together comprise American public health and health care. Already, more isolated outbreaks of measles and other diseases that had previously been stamped out by vaccines are <a href="https://news.ohsu.edu/2024/09/06/measles-cases-on-the-rise-in-oregon-families-urged-to-stay-current-on-vaccinations">occurring</a> at the same time vaccination rates are <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/headed-back-to-school-in-2024-an-update-on-childrens-routine-vaccination-trends/">slipping</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Paul Offit, a pediatric infectious disease doctor who directs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, said Kennedy has had such a big platform for so long that it’s unlikely he’ll be able to scare people about vaccines more than he already has. It’s in delivering the vaccines through programs like Vaccines for Children where he could perhaps do the damage: “If he were able to disrupt that, that would be a problem.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Can RFK Jr. really remove fluoride from US water?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US began fluoridating drinking water in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00056796.htm">1945</a>. An estimated 209 million Americans now drink tap water that contains added fluoride. The intervention is considered a historic public health win: It dramatically <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/11195-fluoride">reduces tooth decay</a> in children and also reduces tooth loss in adults.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy, however, has <a href="https://x.com/robertkennedyjr/status/1852812012478398923?s=46">said</a> he would immediately advise the removal of fluoride from local water supplies. Why? Because he is exaggerating the actual risk.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of the fluoride and US tap water is added by water utility companies, but some tap water contains naturally occurring fluoride it absorbs from the local water table. The resulting high-fluoride tap water, which about 2 million Americans drink, contains about twice the amount of fluoride the US government recommends. According to a recent report from the US National Toxicology Program, drinking high-fluoride water <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/369470/fluoride-iq-kids-brain-development-toothpaste-water-science-study">might be linked to slightly lower IQ scores</a> — by 2 to 5 points in some children —&nbsp;though IQ scores are <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/12/121219133334.htm">an uncertain measure of intelligence</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, there is no indication that tap water containing normal fluoride levels poses this risk — and its benefits to children’s and adult’s dental health are immense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The decision to fluoridate water is one that happens at the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/index.html">state and local level</a>, which is why Kennedy could only advise fluoride’s removal. However, his leadership at HHS could give an opening to anti-fluoride action at the state level, where Republican leaders are increasingly hostile to what had been <a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/trump-vaccine-skepticism-mandates-republican-platform/">settled public health practices</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign on food and chronic diseases</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy has called for a campaign against chronic disease that he’s branded as “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-robert-f-kennedy-make-america-healthy-again/">Make America Healthy Again</a>.” It is an ambiguous and wide-ranging platform, but the consistent theme is undoing what Kennedy sees as Big Pharma and Big Agriculture’s undue influence on what Americans eat and how they manage their health over time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the ideas share the same pseudoscience as Kennedy’s views on vaccines. Kennedy recently <a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1849925311586238737">posted</a> on social media that the FDA had “waged a war on public health” by “aggressive suppression” of Americans’ access to raw milk, among other things. States <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/php/publications/research-anthology-raw-milk.html">aren’t required</a> to pasteurize milk, but the FDA requires milk sold across state lines to be pasteurized. Despite raw milk’s risk of causing life-threatening diarrheal diseases (and now, <a href="https://www.vox.com/24158356/raw-milk-pasteurization-h5n1-bird-flu-sales-consumption-government-trust">bird flu</a>), states can already carve out exceptions that allow their residents to drink it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of Kennedy’s ideas about food are more rooted in reality. For example, his take on nutrition’s role in chronic disease: He has correctly noted that the US has developed <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2023/jan/us-health-care-global-perspective-2022">a terrible record</a> on preventing diabetes, heart disease, and unhealthy weight, and places the blame <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/4891813-robert-kennedy-jr-chronic-disease/">where nutritional experts do</a> — on permissive government policies and dietary guidelines that promote eating lots of ultra-processed foods and low levels of physical activity in schools.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As part of his fight against ultra-processed foods, Kennedy recently said he wants to do away with <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4976746-robert-kennedy-potential-role-trump-administration/">entire departments</a> at the FDA, including the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. According to <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-much-power-do-trump-and-kennedy-have-reshape-health-agencies">recent reporting in <em>Science</em></a>, he could indeed pressure whoever is appointed to lead the agency to eliminate that center, which makes Trump’s choice for FDA commissioner a critical one in setting his administration’s public health agenda. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, if Kennedy wants to restrict the use of already-approved food additives, he needs <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/12/fda-commissioner-califf-trump-election-rfk-jr-public-health-food-nutrition/">more</a> <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/09/26/fda-plan-assess-safety-food-additives/">resources</a> — not fewer: The process involves rigorous reviews of data, issuing public warnings, and actively monitoring the food supply. If Kennedy succeeded in closing the food safety office, that would reduce the number of people who could be dedicated to the job, making it harder rather than easier to rein in the use of these products.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other actions could be taken by the Trump administration to reduce the amount of ultra-processed food in the American food supply, but many of them would be taken outside of HHS. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) sets the guidelines that govern school lunch programs, which means much of what children eat is determined by that agency; Trump has not yet nominated a USDA commissioner. The USDA is also primarily responsible for overseeing factory farming, another industry Kennedy has <a href="https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2024/11/rfk-jr-and-the-make-america-healthy-again-agenda-could-impact-food-safety/#google_vignette">heavily criticized</a> throughout his public career and pledged to target if he were to take a role in the federal government. He would likely need to work with the USDA to follow through. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy is correct that food safety regulation in the US is currently a mess, says David Acheson, an infectious diseases doctor who has led food safety efforts at both the USDA and the FDA. Meat, poultry, and egg plants are inspected daily under the auspices of the USDA, while every other kind of food production facility — including the farms whose produce is responsible for most of the food-borne illness in the US and the nation’s countless other industrial food manufacturers — are inspected by FDA inspectors at most once a year. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would make far more sense to unify these functions under one agency and harmonize the frequency of food production facility inspections so none are falling through the cracks. That is the kind of organizational shake-up that could actually make a difference.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Acheson would also like to see Kennedy take on the FDA’s process for regulating supplements, which are currently subject to lax oversight <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dietary-supplements-protein-powders-what-to-watch-out-for/">despite obvious health risks</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What happens to NIH in a second Trump term?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At a town hall earlier this year, before dropping out of the race for president, Kennedy <a href="https://x.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1803974935091761518">said</a> that if elected, he’d tell the NIH to pause drug development and infectious diseases for eight years and instead focus on chronic diseases. He also <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/rfk-kennedy-anti-vaccine-panel-conspiracies-hiv-spanish-flu-1234779689/">pledged</a> during his own campaign for president that he would block <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/10/19/23412562/covid-omircron-gain-of-function-research-engineered-pandemic-biosafety">“gain of function” research</a> — in which scientists purposefully make viruses more dangerous in hopes of learning how to better combat them — that has come under more scrutiny since the pandemic. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apart from the fact that the NIH already spends about <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775642">$20 billion annually</a> on chronic disease, this would be disastrous: The basic research the agency funds and conducts in its own institutes lays the groundwork for therapies pharmaceutical companies develop to treat most medical conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kennedy has called for firing 600 of the agency’s <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/rfk-replace-hundreds-federal-health-workers-nih-1984114">nearly 19,000 employees</a> and replacing them with new ones, who presumably would be more keen to carry out his priorities. Conservatives have also <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/12/nx-s1-5183014/trump-election-2024-nih-rfk">floated</a> restructuring the NIH, and Trump proposed cutting its $48 billion budget during his first term.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s be clear: Not everything Donald Trump has proposed to do in his upcoming administration is a threat American democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384320/trump-cabinet-white-house">Cabinet appointments</a>, like Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state or former Rep. Lee Zeldin for Environmental Protection Agency administrator, are basically what you’d expect from Republicans. You might disagree with their policies, but you can’t seriously argue they represent threats to the rule of law or democratic norms. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others, like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, are troublingly unqualified and even outright dangerous — but not an immediate five-alarm fire for American democracy specifically.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet at the same time, there is already clear and undeniable cause for alarm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around the world, there are certain steps a leader takes if they want to destroy a country’s democracy, like putting loyalists in charge of law enforcement and politicizing the armed forces. Many of Trump’s early decisions fit this pattern to a T.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest red flag is the choice of arch-loyalist Matt Gaetz as attorney general. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is arguably the single most powerful domestic policy agency, running everything from the FBI to federal criminal prosecutors to civil rights litigation. Gaetz has few, if any, qualifications to manage all of this — except for his vendetta against the department, as it once investigated him on suspicion of sex crimes. (Gaetz denies the allegations and the DOJ <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">dropped its investigation</a> into them in 2023.)<strong> </strong>His pitch for the job, <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/donald-trump-is-dead-serious-about">one Trump insider told the Bulwark</a>, was to “go over there and start cuttin’ fuckin’ heads.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s plans for the military are similarly ominous. Two teams of reporters, in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/trump-draft-executive-order-would-create-board-to-purge-generals-7ebaa606">the Wall Street Journal</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-team-drawing-up-list-pentagon-officers-fire-sources-say-2024-11-13/">Reuters</a> respectively, have uncovered plans for a political purge of the brass — potentially including the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump’s proposed secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, is a Fox News commentator and MAGA diehard who called for <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/pete-hegseths-plan-overhaul-americas-military-fire-ton/story?id=115842674">precisely such a purge</a> in a recent book.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s Trump’s scheme to get his Cabinet picks in office. If the Republican Senate actually does block any of these picks, Trump has <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384356/trump-recess-appointments-explained-senate-confirmation-thune-scott-cornyn-cabinet">demanded the power</a> to install them through recess appointments while the chamber is out of session. If enough senators balk, Trump reportedly has put together <a href="https://x.com/AJentleson/status/1857081316937761089">a complicated backup plan</a> that boils down to the House giving him the power to go around the Senate entirely —&nbsp;effectively eviscerating its constitutional advice-and-consent role on appointments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, we don’t know how much of these really bad ideas will come to pass. Trump is famous for saying things and failing to follow through. But given the enormity of the tail risk —&nbsp;the corrosion of American democracy — it’s critical to take what’s happening right now seriously.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that means being clear-eyed about the Trump agenda: both what’s not so scary about it, and what is.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The “authoritarian checklist” that can guide us through Trump 2.0</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The United States is not the only democracy to elect an authoritarian of late. Voters in a series of other countries — including Brazil, Hungary, India, Israel, Philippines, Poland, Turkey, and Venezuela — have elevated similarly dangerous leaders in recent elections. None of these countries are exactly like the United States, but all have some things in common that can give us guidance as to what to expect. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most important similarities is that none of these country’s leaders openly campaigned on abolishing democracy. The concept remained far too popular among both citizens and elites to act like Hitler and abolish elections outright.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, they made incremental changes that would slowly-but-surely increase their own power while neutering opponents both in and out of the government. No one step marks the end of democracy, but each cumulatively makes it a little bit weaker. If this process reaches its endpoint, elections become functionally meaningless — theoretically free contests that in actuality are nearly impossible for the incumbent party to lose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Executing this strategy requires a few key moves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, would-be authoritarians need the loyalists in key government positions. No one can hollow out an entire government on their own — it’s simply too towering a task to micro-manage. So they delegate, empowering individuals with unwavering loyalty and dedication to remaking key government institutions along authoritarian lines. In India, for example, the second-most powerful position in government — home minister — is occupied by a man named Amit Shah, a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-68653573">close friend and comrade</a> of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s since 1982.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, they need those appointees to eviscerate legal and political guardrails on their power. Independent prosecutors, government accountability offices, courts, legislative prerogatives — all of this needs to be either co-opted or eliminated. The <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/1/3/24022467/israel-supreme-court-judicial-overhaul-reasonableness-basic-law-overturn">failed 2023 judicial overhaul in Israel</a>, which would have effectively stripped its courts of any ability to check Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s power, is an unusually stark example of such a move.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After these first two steps have succeeded in consolidating power over the state, the authoritarian then wields it to weaken dissenters outside of government&nbsp;— with the ultimate aim of tilting the playing field on which elections take place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t just mean obvious things, like formally restricting free speech rights, but more subtle tools, like wielding tax agencies and spurious legal investigations against critics and potential private sector rivals. Hungary’s Viktor Orbán <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/9/13/17823488/hungary-democracy-authoritarianism-trump">is the pioneer here</a>, using something as seemingly benign as government ad spending to bring the Hungarian media under his control.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Through all of this, they need to be able to count on the loyalty of the security services as a last resort. In between elections, would-be authoritarians fear nothing more than popular uprisings and military coups. Stacking the intelligence community and armed forces with loyalists is the best way to ensure that coups fail (as happened <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/7/15/12204172/turkey-coup-erdogan-military">in Turkey in 2016</a>) or to violently repress street protests if necessary (as happened <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/06/venezuela-election-maduro-analysis">after Venezuela’s stolen election earlier this year</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These four points — appoint loyalists, eviscerate guardrails, attack dissent, suborn armed forces — are the key benchmarks one should use for evaluating Trump’s policies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does what he’s proposing truly further one of those objectives? If so, by how much? How likely is it to happen? And how does the threat level rank relative to other things that he’s doing?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Grading Trump’s early decisions by the checklist</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trying to assess Trump’s policies on these metrics is not some kind of academic game.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those of us who care about democracy, in the press and elsewhere, need to maintain our credibility with potentially persuadable third parties&nbsp;— like swing voters or moderate Republican senators. Being seen as liberal hacks who call any Republican appointee a threat to democracy is a problem; so too is developing a track record of crying wolf by labeling everything Trump does anti-democratic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this spirit, it’s clear what emerges as the most dangerous move of Trump’s early transition: the Gaetz pick.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is hard to imagine someone <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/04/matt-gaetz-house-republican-congress-profile/677915/?gift=zYCTBrO_7y7KHmiTPdBdgz2i_q9mnP-Ul9A5kUUNFTY&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share">more cravenly loyal to Trump than Gaetz</a>. It is hard to imagine anyone who has a more serious vendetta against nonpartisan administration of laws, since Gaetz was once the target of a federal investigation. And it is hard to imagine a more important position than attorney general — one that gives immense power both to eviscerate guardrails and to punish private sector dissenters with <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/185487/trump-maga-legal-war-slow-burn-authoritarianism">spurious criminal investigations</a> (among other tools).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Department of Defense plans aren’t too far behind. Purging the Joint Chiefs based on political loyalty — excuse me, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-vows-fire-generals-push-wokeness-cant-woke-military">alleged “wokeness”</a> — removes one of the chief barriers to Trump’s alleged desire to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/trumps-insurrection-act-threat">invoke the Insurrection Act</a> and deploy soldiers against protesters at home. Hegseth isn’t quite as egregious a Cabinet choice as Gaetz, but it’s hard to imagine someone who has proposed such purges and regularly praises Trump on TV standing in the way of his boss’s plans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can go on down the list.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plan for circumventing the Senate’s advice-and-consent power would be extremely threatening to guardrails if it happened, but it’s unclear how likely it is to happen. Gabbard as director of national intelligence raises some troubling questions about politicizing intelligence, but she’s not as much of a Trump toady as a Gaetz or even a Hegseth. Kennedy is almost certainly a disaster for public health, but not an obvious threat to democracy narrowly speaking. The Office of Presidential Personnel is small potatoes compared to a Cabinet post, but Trump’s decision to put <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/13/us/politics/trump-personnel-sergio-gor.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">his book publisher in charge of it</a> will facilitate his plans for seeding the entire government with loyalists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By contrast, there’s no reason to think appointments like Rubio or Zeldin even register on this scale. These are the kind of appointments you’d expect from any Republican, and while their policies may be terrible, they’re not an attack on our system of government. In terms of protecting our democracy, the question for them isn’t whether they themselves are a sign of authoritarian rot, but whether they would have the courage to resist it while in power (color me skeptical).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ranking these matters for more than just credibility purposes. Democracy’s defenders have limited resources and energy, especially when both chambers of Congress and the Supreme Court are controlled by Republicans. They need to prioritize which Trump appointments and policies to fight, a task made far more difficult by the deluge of daily outrages that we all remember from Trump’s first term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That requires being clear-eyed about what really is threatening and what isn’t. And at present, an objective evaluation of Trump’s early proposals should give Americans a hell of a lot to worry about.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every year since 2019, Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank and polling organization, has asked nearly 10,000 American adults how they feel about science.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2019, the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2019/08/02/trust-and-mistrust-in-americans-views-of-scientific-experts/">vast majority of people surveyed</a> across the political spectrum were confident that scientists act in the public’s best interest. In fact, Americans placed more confidence in scientists than nearly anyone else, including elected officials, journalists, business leaders, and even schoolteachers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then the Covid-19 pandemic happened. Democrats doubled down in their confidence while Republicans lost theirs. During the height of the pandemic, this partisan divide in science skepticism <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/3/8/23630644/cochrane-review-masks-covid-coronavirus-pandemic">manifested</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/5/13/21257181/coronavirus-masks-trump-republicans-culture-war">as culture wars</a> between those who wore masks and lined up for vaccines, and those who did not.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The public’s trust — or lack thereof — in science shapes political decisions around <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/378359/hurricane-climate-change-flood-helene-milton-warming">climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/377739/autism-research-mice-lab-models">research funding</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/22893078/fda-covid-19-too-cautious-tests-vaccines">food and drug regulation</a>. As Donald Trump prepares to take office again, the scientific community is grappling with <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/09/trump-administration-healthcare-policy-realistic-expectations-rfk-jr/">what his agenda means for them</a>. Scientists <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/08/nx-s1-4916564/trump-science-censorship-fears">worry</a> that a second Trump term will stall efforts to fight climate change and eviscerate federal agencies involved in public health.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2024/11/14/public-trust-in-scientists-and-views-on-their-role-in-policymaking/">Pew’s latest survey</a>, Republican confidence in science went up this year, the first increase in trust reported since before the pandemic. But the incoming Trump administration, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381470/trump-rfk-cabinet-hhs-vaccines-health">now prominently featuring Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a>, is placing science skepticism at the heart of promises to “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2024/11/robert-kennedy-jr-trump-maha/680612/">Make America Healthy Again</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The belief that health care practitioners, federal agencies, and institutions of science are colluding against us is being pushed by rising GOP leaders like <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/07/calley-means-casey-means-conservative-voices-of-chronic-disease-crisis/">conservative health influencers Calley and Casey Means</a> to stoke conservative anxieties. According to Pew, nearly two-thirds of conservatives believe that scientists should stay out of science-related policy debates. Now that <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trump-hhs-secretary-pick-00188617" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/14/robert-f-kennedy-jr-trump-hhs-secretary-pick-00188617">Trump has selected Kennedy</a> to lead <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/06/presidential-election-trump-health-care-abortion-medicare-rfk/">the Department of Health and Human Services</a> (HHS), those conservatives may get their wish.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are three charts that make sense of America’s relationship with science today, and highlight how scientists can earn the public’s trust back.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Confidence in science is rising for the first time since early 2020 — but trust splits along party lines</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Covid-19 <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/15/17948062/pandemic-flu-ebola-h1n1-outbreak-infectious-disease">caught the world with its pants down</a>, and public trust in science never fully recovered. As the virus spread, the imperfect process of science was laid out for everyone to see.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Normally, publishing a biomedical science paper is a years-long process. The experiments themselves can take many weeks or months, depending on the nature of the project. Once data is analyzed, written up, and submitted to a journal for peer review, it can take anywhere from a few months to a few years to get published — reviewers often ask scientists to make changes or include more information, to make sure their findings are as airtight as possible.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story was first featured in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/pages/future-perfect-newsletter-signup">Future Perfect newsletter</a>.</h2>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But in the early stages of the pandemic, people were desperate for answers — and scientists stepped into the vacuum to publish <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22776428/ivermectin-science-publication-research-fraud">rushed, sometimes error-filled papers</a> without peer review. Journalists published news articles about those pre-print studies <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23017140/media-journalists-pandemic-covid-lab-leak-coronavirus">without effectively communicating their uncertainty</a>. Policymakers were left to make huge decisions based on limited, inconclusive, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22776428/ivermectin-science-publication-research-fraud">sometimes downright fraudulent</a> data.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But science is a messy, nonlinear process, and new data can overturn previously held truths at any moment. The scientific method involves making an educated guess about how the world works, finding a way to test that guess, and seeing what happens — basically, science is the act of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tysaiahfranklin/video/7148626782084697390?lang=en">messing around and finding out</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In most cases, it takes many iterations of this process before the scientific community reaches a consensus (and even then, new experiments can <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replication-crisis-peer-review-statistics">shatter what was once accepted as fact</a>). For scientists, this is a given. “The consistency is only to the data, not your position,” said <a href="https://www.aaas.org/person/sudip-parikh">Sudip Parikh</a>, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem, he said, is that politics don’t work that way. “In politics, you should be consistent about your position,” Parikh said. And when you’re not consistent, as Vice President Kamala Harris discovered during the 2024 campaign, voters can punish you for it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So when the government seemed to flip-flop during the pandemic — like telling people to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/3/21202792/coronavirus-masks-n95-trump-white-house-cdc-ppe-shortage">only wear cloth masks</a> to preserve limited supplies for front line health care workers, only to later say that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/1/8/22873390/covid-19-better-masks-n95-respirator-surgical-omicron">cloth masks aren’t very effective</a> — most people didn’t instinctively think it was all part of the learning process. They felt betrayed. And that sense of betrayal <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/21364099/covid-19-vaccine-hesitancy-research-herd-immunity">ultimately extended to vaccines</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The public lost trust in science for years following the pandemic. According to Pew, though Democrats’ confidence fell by a few percentage points between 2019 and 2023, they still overwhelmingly trusted scientists throughout the pandemic. Republicans’ trust, however, plummeted between 2020 and 2021, and it’s only just beginning to recover. The massive partisan divide is striking: When surveyed in October, 88 percent of Democrats said they have “a fair amount” or “a great deal” of confidence in scientists, compared to 66 percent of Republicans.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Most people agree that scientists are smart, but bad at communicating</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked, about 9 in 10 people, regardless of party affiliation, agreed that research scientists are “intelligent.” <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/staff/alec-tyson/">Alec Tyson</a>, an associate director of research at Pew, pointed out that in general, scientists “engender high levels of trust from the public in a low-trust era,” inspiring more votes of confidence than people are willing to give just about any other occupation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, while over three-quarters of Democrats believe scientists are also “honest” and “focus on solving real-world problems,” only about half of Republicans agree. On the flip side, many more Republicans than Democrats agree that scientists are cold, closed-minded, ignore moral values of society, and feel superior to others.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PS_24.11.14_trust_p13.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,29.789356308421,100,40.421287383157" alt="A figure from Pew Research Center illustrating that Republicans and Democrats differ in views of research scientists’ traits, including honesty." title="A figure from Pew Research Center illustrating that Republicans and Democrats differ in views of research scientists’ traits, including honesty." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The majority of Americans surveyed also think scientists are socially awkward and bad at communicating. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Look, scientists are human,” Parikh said. “We have the whole spectrum of the population. Every personality type that’s out in the real world is in the scientific laboratory as well.” So, sure — some scientists are certainly socially awkward (and as a former scientist, I’ve both witnessed and likely contributed to this stereotype). And unfortunately, scientists rarely learn how to write for non-academic audiences or speak with the press as part of their training.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are some easy steps scientists can take to improve their overall vibe. A group of scientists, including <a href="https://www.samanthayammine.com/">Samantha Yammine</a> and<a href="https://thebrainscientist.com/"> Daniel Toker</a> (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/science.sam/">@ScienceSam</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_brain_scientist/?hl=en">@the_brain_scientist</a> on both Instagram and TikTok), <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0216625#abstract0">ran an experiment</a> in 2019 to see whether posting selfies on social media could change people’s perception of scientists. When scientists <a href="https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/macroscope/scientists-who-selfie-break-down-stereotypes">posted friendly-looking pictures of themselves</a> against a science-y backdrop, like their lab bench, viewers rated them as significantly warmer than if they had posted a picture of their lab equipment alone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Parikh thinks that building long-term relationships between researchers, policymakers, reporters, and their community — whether through social media, <a href="https://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships">fellowship programs</a>, or<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22177247/citizen-science-amateur-backyard-birding-astronomy-covid-pandemic"> citizen science</a> — can strengthen trust over time. “Science is a human endeavor,” Parikh said. “The way you build trust is by being open and honest about both the strengths and the limitations of your process.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Most Republicans don’t want scientists involved in science-related policy decisions</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pew’s survey asked respondents another big question: “If you trust scientists,” Tyson said, “what role do you want them to play in public life?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/ncses22204/assets/federal-scientists-and-engineers/ncses22204.pdf">According to the National Science Foundation</a>, the federal government in 2020 employed about 175,000 scientists, the vast majority of whom conduct research for the Department of Defense. Though elected officials hold final authority, scientists can influence policy decisions <a href="https://www.acs.org/careers/chemical-sciences/fields/science-policy.html">by advising politicians</a>, and may work for the federal government, or nongovernmental organizations like universities or think tanks. In times of crisis, like the Covid-19 pandemic, scientists in government have the power to sway decisions that affect everyone.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People were divided: About half of US adults think scientists should take an active role in science-related policy debates, while the other half thinks scientists should just stick to science. Again, there was a big partisan gap, with many more Republicans wanting scientists to stay out of policy debates.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/PS_24.11.14_trust_p14.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.794820999009,100,50.410358001981" alt="A figure from Pew Research Center illustrates that Americans are divided over the role for scientists in scientific policy debates." title="A figure from Pew Research Center illustrates that Americans are divided over the role for scientists in scientific policy debates." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">One possible explanation, Parikh said, is that people are worried that scientists are so married to their data, they ignore everything else. During the 2020 lockdowns, for example, many people disagreed with <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/16/21180629/coronavirus-new-york-city-public-schools-closed">school closures</a> — though closing schools was <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-03-31-school-closures-may-reduce-covid-19-transmission-may-also-harm-childrens-education">a largely evidence-based decision</a>, that evidence was limited and uncertain, and closures ultimately caused real, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23584869/covid-coronavirus-school-closures-remote-education-learning-loss-psychological-depression-teens">lasting damage to children’s education and mental health</a>. In policy debates like that, where scientific evidence is pitted against economic reality, family values, and individual emotions, some people may worry that scientists would only consider the science.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not to say that science and data matter when it comes to policymaking — nearly all hot-button issues today, like reproductive care, climate change, and drug regulation, have science at their core. But science and data are “not the only part of the equation,” Parikh said. “That’s why we have policymakers. We have to have a discussion about what the data means.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tyson’s team has an eye on the Trump administration’s health proposals, and what they might mean for the public’s perception of science. While it’s too early to know exactly what role he will play, Kennedy has long held outright conspiratorial beliefs around <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/08/30/rfk-jr-trump-campaign-public-health-policy-issue/">vaccines</a>,<a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/369470/fluoride-iq-kids-brain-development-toothpaste-water-science-study"> fluoride</a>,<a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/31/trump-rfk-food-pharma-00186513"> seed oils, and pesticides</a>, and has <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/06/trump-victory-upend-fda-rfk-jr-influence-vaccines-prescriptions/">said he would</a> dramatically restructure HHS, the federal organization responsible for public health. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think we’ll be ready, a year from now, to take stock of the change in administration and see where the conversation goes from there,” Tyson said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, science communicators believed that the gap between scientists and the rest of the population could be explained by inadequate information. This paradigm, called the “<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7506985/">deficit model</a>,” states that if only the public were more educated about the scientific method, they would be more willing to trust scientific expertise. In this model, scientists hold crucial information that non-scientists don’t have, and sharing that information should be enough to sway hearts and minds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While that theory makes some intuitive sense, it doesn’t seem to be how humans actually work. Pew reported that, among politically aligned voters, whether someone went to college didn’t change their trust in science. It’s not about education — it’s about transparency, relationship-building, and a willingness to acknowledge when science makes mistakes. If the deficit model were an experiment, the data would suggest it’s not working.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While I don’t believe that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/yes-science-is-political/">science is — or should be — apolitical</a>, it ought to be bipartisan. “It’s a process for thinking,” Parikh said, “and that process for thinking is not partisan.” Parikh is cautiously optimistic that this year’s upswing in Republican confidence in science marks the beginning of the end of science’s post-pandemic slump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If we can do five point increases for three years in a row on the Republican side, we’re right back at complete bipartisanship,” Parikh said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to imagine a worse time for the Supreme Court to hear <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-skrmetti/"><em>United States v. Skrmetti</em></a>, arguably the most important trans rights case the justices have ever heard. <em>Skrmetti</em> asks whether discrimination against transgender people can violate the Constitution, a question the Court has never answered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A decision against the trans plaintiffs in <em>Skrmetti</em>, moreover, could potentially upend the entire legal framework protecting Americans from gender discrimination of all kinds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A Court with a 6-3 Republican supermajority plans to hear <em>Skrmetti</em> in early December, less than a month after an election in which, according to the Washington Post, GOP campaigns “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/11/05/election-trans-sports-trump-campaign/">spent at least $215 million</a> on network ads that paint trans people as a menace to society.” President-elect Donald Trump made <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-transgender-politics-61cff97a64fac581ffc5f762be4c57d3">anti-trans rhetoric a key part of his campaign</a>, promising, for example, that if elected, he would keep “transgender insanity the hell out of our schools, and we will keep men out of women’s sports.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is to say: This case arrives at a moment in which the Republican Party is all in on animus toward transgender people. And, while there are strong legal arguments supporting the pro-trans rights position in <em>Skrmetti</em>, this panel of justices has shown <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/371361/supreme-court-call-republican-justices-republicans">great deference to the general mood of the Republican Party</a> in past decisions, like when they ruled that Trump may <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/358292/supreme-court-trump-immunity-dictatorship">use his official presidential powers to commit crimes once he returns to office</a>. If the Court’s Republican majority is determined to reach an anti-trans result, they likely won’t let something as trivial as “the law” discourage them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, at least two of the Court’s Republicans have shown unexpected sympathy toward LGBTQ litigants in the past. In <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15591206893890926746&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em></a> (2020), the Court ruled that a longstanding ban on sex discrimination in employment prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity — declaring that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Bostock</em> was authored by Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts, who is also a Republican. So, if Roberts and Gorsuch hold to the views they expressed in <em>Bostock</em>, the two of them plus the three Democratic justices should be enough to extend at least some constitutional protection to trans people.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s at stake in <em>Skrmetti</em>?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The specific issue in <em>Skrmetti </em>is a Tennessee law prohibiting trans youth from receiving medical treatments such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. About <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/371341/supreme-court-new-term-transgender-ghost-guns-porn-vapes">half of states</a> have laws targeting transgender health care, but Tennessee’s is among the strictest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the Court has never held specifically that discrimination against transgender people violates the Constitution, it has long held that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/9/18/20917757/justice-ginsburg-ruth-bader-ginsburg-dies">sex discrimination does violate the Constitution</a>, ruling that “<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">all gender-based classifications</a>” are presumptively unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Virginia</em> (1996).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tennessee’s law trips over itself to classify young patients based on their gender. It declares that the law’s purpose is to “<a href="https://casetext.com/statute/tennessee-code/title-68-health-safety-and-environmental-protection/health/chapter-33-health-and-welfare-of-minors/section-68-33-101-findings">encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex</a>” and to prevent young people from becoming “disdainful of their sex.” The law also denies certain medical treatments to patients based solely on their sex. A patient who was assigned male at birth may have testosterone prescribed by a doctor, but someone assigned female at birth may not have that treatment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Again, the Supreme Court has already said that <em>all </em>gender-based classifications are constitutionally dubious. “All” means “all.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Will that be enough to persuade these justices to strike down Tennessee&#8217;s law? The honest answer is, “Who knows?” It’s not like legal texts and Supreme Court precedents play no role in these justices’ decision-making, and they sometimes even hand down a decision like <em>Bostock</em> that cuts strongly against the Republican Party’s policy preferences.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are two reasons to be pessimistic about <em>Skrmetti</em>. One is that after the recent election, anti-trans voices within the Court are likely to be emboldened, and pro-trans voices may feel like they have limited political capital. The other is that, while Tennessee’s law clearly discriminates on the basis of sex, the Court has only held that laws that do so should be presumed to be unconstitutional unless — as the Court put it in <em>Virginia — </em>there’s an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for the law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is possible that this Court will hold that a ban on trans health care meets this bar.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What current law says about “sex” discrimination, explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of federal law’s core safeguards against sex discrimination emerged in the 1960s and 1970s. Beginning in the ’60s, Congress started to pass laws banning sex discrimination in various venues — Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/6/15/21291515/supreme-court-bostock-clayton-county-lgbtq-neil-gorsuch">prohibits such discrimination in employment</a>. Then, in the 1970s, the Court began to place constitutional limits on the government’s ability to discriminate on the basis of sex.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most significant of these cases, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2528522570594071994&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>Craig v. Boren</em></a> (1976), established that any government action that classifies people based on sex is presumptively unconstitutional. Again, in <em>Virginia, </em>the Court stated that “a party seeking to uphold government action based on sex must establish an ‘<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">exceedingly persuasive justification</a>’ for the classification.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The federal appeals court that heard <em>Skrmetti</em> attempted to get around <em>Craig</em> and <em>Virginia</em> by pointing to the Supreme Court’s decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4447817874641898447&amp;q=geduldig+v.+aiello&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,47&amp;as_vis=1"><em>Geduldig v. Aiello</em></a> (1974). But that decision read <em>Geduldig </em>far too broadly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Briefly, <em>Geduldig</em> concerned a state-run insurance program that provided benefits to some California workers with disabilities, but not to workers whose disabilities arose out of a pregnancy. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that this exclusion for pregnant workers discriminated on the basis of sex, even though the Court wrote that “only women can become pregnant.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Geduldig</em>, it should be noted, is not a particularly beloved decision. Four years after it was handed down, Congress enacted the <a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/statutes/pregnancy-discrimination-act-1978">Pregnancy Discrimination Act</a>, which repudiated <em>Geduldig</em> in the workplace and forbade employers from discriminating on the basis of pregnancy. Regardless, <em>Geduldig</em>’s holding was limited. It established that the government may set up public benefit programs that exclude medical procedures “<a href="https://casetext.com/case/l-w-v-skrmetti-3">that only one sex can undergo</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Skrmetti</em>, by contrast, involves medical procedures that both sexes can undergo. Anyone can take puberty blockers, testosterone, or estrogen. It is not physically impossible to administer testosterone to someone assigned female at birth in the same way that it is physically impossible for a person without a uterus to become pregnant.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Not all sex discrimination is forbidden</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the Court’s decisions in <em>Craig</em> and <em>Virginia</em>, it should be obvious that Tennessee&#8217;s law draws distinctions based on sex and thus can only survive if the state can offer an “exceedingly persuasive justification” for it. Indeed, if the Court were to reject that conclusion, it would do considerable violence to the legal principles governing all gender discrimination cases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, even if the Court honors the <em>Craig</em>/<em>Virginia</em> framework, Tennessee’s law could potentially survive if five of the justices deem the state’s arguments for the law sufficiently persuasive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The briefs in the <em>Skrmetti</em> case paint two very different pictures of why medical professionals treat transgender patients with puberty blockers or hormones. A <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323551/20240827210326240_23-477tsUnitedStates.pdf">brief filed by the Biden administration</a>, for example, warns that the absence of these treatments can lead patients with gender dysphoria (the medical term for the distress that can result when someone’s gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth) to “‘debilitating distress,’ ‘depression,’ ‘substance use,’ ‘self-injurious behaviors,’ and ‘even suicide.’” One <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6803a3.htm">survey</a> referenced in the brief found that more than one-third of transgender high school students attempted suicide in the last 12 months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This view, which presents gender-affirming treatments as a way to prevent suicide and alleviate the harms of gender dysphoria, is supported by briefs filed by medical and mental health groups such as the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323885/20240903123631640_23-477%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20American%20Psychological%20Association%20et%20al..pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323885/20240903123631640_23-477%20Amicus%20Brief%20of%20American%20Psychological%20Association%20et%20al..pdf">American Psychological Association</a>, the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/323964/20240903155151548_23-477%20tsac%20Brief%20of%20Amici%20Curiae%20AAP%20et%20al..pdf">American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH), and the American Medical Association</a> — among other, similar professional organizations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/23/23-477/327730/20241008130915048_23-477%20Respondents%20Brief.pdf">Tennessee’s brief</a>, meanwhile, presents a much more conspiratorial picture. At one point, for example, it claims that a transgender official within the Biden administration pressured the WPATH to issue inappropriately permissive guidelines on trans health care for physicians. At another point, it suggests that a major hospital in Tennessee started providing transgender health care because doing so would “make a lot of money” for the hospital.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do Tennessee&#8217;s arguments meet the threshold of an “exceedingly persuasive justification”? It’s worth noting that the trial court which heard <em>Skrmetti</em>, the only court to closely examine the evidence on either side of the case, temporarily blocked Tennessee’s law during an early hearing in this case. Of course, it’s possible that a full trial will reveal that Tennessee&#8217;s more conspiratorial view of the facts is correct, but there’s good reason to be skeptical that all of the major professional organizations representing pediatricians, psychologists, trans health providers, and physicians generally are all engaged in a grand conspiracy to make more money by overmedicating transgender children.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There’s some chance the Court will hit pause on this case</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is some chance that the Court will delay resolution of this case, although probably not for very long.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the lower courts, both the Biden administration and lawyers for a group of transgender plaintiffs argued the pro-trans position. After they lost in the appeals court, both the <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/united-states-v-skrmetti/">Justice Department</a> and the <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/l-w-v-skrmetti/">private plaintiffs</a> asked the justices to hear their case. Although these two petitions present similar questions, the Court decided only to grant the Justice Department’s request to hear the case — which is why the case is currently called <em>United States v. Skrmetti</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus far, the Court has taken no action on the private plaintiffs’ petition, which is known as <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/l-w-v-skrmetti/"><em>L.W. v. Skrmetti</em></a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ordinarily, the Court’s decision to grant one petition and not the other wouldn’t matter very much. But it is exceedingly likely that the Trump administration will reverse the Justice Department’s position on this case once it takes power in January and formally withdraw its request for the justices to hear this case. That means that if the justices want to hold on to the case past January, they will need to grant the <em>L.W.</em> petition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Realistically, none of these procedural maneuvers are likely to change much. It’s possible that the Court will delay oral arguments until all of this is resolved. But, if the justices want to resolve the issue presented by <em>Skrmetti</em>, there’s no reason why the Court can’t decide this case in its current term (which means a decision is likely in late June), regardless of how the procedural drama shakes out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, conservatives on social media claimed an unlikely new icon. It wasn’t a podcaster with questionable views or a libertarian businessman selling a course or any particular ideology. It was actress Sydney Sweeney, <em>Euphoria</em> star and the recent lead of the rom-com <em>Anyone but You.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following her <em>Saturday Night Live</em> hosting gig in March, two conservative outlets <a href="https://nationalpost.com/opinion/amy-hamm-wokeness-is-no-match-for-sydney-sweeneys-undeniable-beauty">published</a> <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/boobs-are-back-thank-you-sydney-sweeney/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1709711300-2">columns</a> heralding Sweeney as a return to conventional beauty standards of the ’90s and early 2000s — or as, Bridget Phetasy for the Spectator put it, “the giggling blonde with an amazing rack.” Both pieces<strong> </strong>postulate that, by wearing low-cut dresses and playing up her sexuality, Sweeney was inviting men to gawk at her, therefore raising a middle finger to “woke culture” and the Me Too movement.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sweeney hasn’t publicly aligned herself with the right in any way. (Her <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/sydney-sweeney-responds-maga-supporting-family-member-controversy-1234629337/">family’s politics</a>, though, were the subject of controversy in 2022, which may have something to do with the right’s eager embrace of her.) Rather, her ascension as a throwback-y, hyper-feminine sex symbol has given conservatives the rare mainstream Gen Z figure on whom to project their values. For those paying close attention, the past year was rife with springboards for the conservative message.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the hindsight following Trump’s reelection, it seems the zeitgeist of 2024 was a foreshadowing of his return to office and something forecasters might have considered a little more seriously. “Bro country” singers became the artists de jour, going head-to-head with female pop singers on the charts and, in many cases, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/359734/female-pop-stars-charts-billboard-rap-country-popularity">outperforming them</a>. The buzziest new reality shows were about <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/360219/dcc-dallas-cowboys-cheerleaders-netflix-judi-kelli-victoria-kalina">Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/374143/secret-lives-mormon-wives-momtok-utah">Mormon TikTokers</a>. Conservative films from smaller distributors, like the biopic <em>Reagan</em> and Daily Wire documentary <em>Am I Racist?</em>, made millions at the box office. Nominally apolitical podcasters and streamers, from Joe Rogan to the Nelk Boys, hosted presidential <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/380008/harris-trump-podcast-interviews-appearances-joe-rogan-shannon-sharpe-theo-von-call-her-daddy-flagrant">candidates</a> and took on an increasingly political valence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a sharp turn from the <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/obamacore-obama-pop-culture-kamala-harris.html">liberal-coded pop culture of the Obama years</a> and the sort of trends that took off in response to Trump’s first presidency — comic-book movies with a progressive edge like <em>Wonder Woman</em> and <em>Black Panther, </em>social commentary films like <em>Get Out</em> and <em>Promising Young Woman</em>, not to mention <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/drag-race-inc-whats-lost-when-a-subculture-goes-pop.html">the explosion of drag culture</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Joel Penney, an associate professor at Montclair State University, says the overall conservative feel of pop culture at the moment is, in many ways, a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23581859/me-too-backlash-susan-faludi-weinstein-roe-dobbs-depp-heard">response to the Me Too movement</a> and the notion by its detractors that “masculinity is in crisis.” At the same time that we’re seeing Sweeney receive praise for representing “traditional” femininity, the All-American straight white “bro” is getting renewed cultural attention.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s been a lot of this trying to restore these strong male role models in pop culture, whether it’s Tom Cruise in the <em>Top Gun</em> remake or these ‘bro’ podcasters and country singers,” Penney says.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>2024 was all about the straight white bro&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can see this happening most visibly in mainstream music. It’s not just that country music — a Southern genre with a past and present of conservative politics — has emerged in the mainstream over the past two years — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-cover/">with</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/morgan-wallen-arrest-controversy-timeline-b2525290.html">much</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23842173/oliver-anthony-rich-men-controversy-morgan-wallen-jason-aldean-small-town-political">controversy</a>. It’s that this class of musicians — Morgan Wallen, Zach Bryan, Jelly Roll, Luke Combs, Shaboozey, and the newly rustic Post Malone — are glaringly male. Shaboozey’s unprecedented achievements in an overwhelmingly white genre add a refreshing element to this conversation. Beyoncé also released a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24115959/beyonce-cowboy-carter-country-music-explained">successful country album</a> this year featuring Shaboozey and an array of Black female country artists.<em> Cowboy Carter</em>’s lead single, “Texas Hold ’Em,” topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks, a shorter amount of time than Morgan Wallen, Post Malone, and Shaboozey’s No.1 songs this year. Nor was she recognized by the country establishment, getting completely <a href="https://thehilltoponline.com/2024/09/16/beyonces-cowboy-carter-receives-zero-cma-nominations/">shut out of the Country Music Association awards</a>. Overall, it seems like country fans and the average young person, who’s <a href="https://variety.com/2023/music/news/cmts-morgan-wallen-country-streaming-march-1235573629/">listening to more country music</a> these days, are still more eager to hear dudes croon about beer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Outside of the charts, these country singers have also become mainstream personalities and subjects of celebrity gossip. In the span of roughly a year, Bryan went from a <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/pulling-weeds-chris-black-zach-bryan">little-known alternative country crooner posting YouTube videos</a> to a celebrity whose personal relationships are being <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@abbzbon/video/7435029860285746474">analyzed</a> by <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bethanysware/video/7434745300285246763">TikTok</a> users and explained in the pages of <a href="https://people.com/zach-bryan-brianna-chickenfry-relationship-timeline-7866836">People</a>. Jelly Roll and his wife, influencer and popular podcast host Bunnie XO, have also become a recognizable celebrity couple, while Wallen’s <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/07/31/entertainment/country-singer-megan-moroney-addresses-morgan-wallen-dating-rumors/">dating life</a> and <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/04/08/entertainment/morgan-wallen-arrested-after-allegedly-throwing-chair-off-bar-roof/">public antics</a> have become<em> </em>Page Six fodder. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elsewhere in pop culture, figures seemingly designated for a more male, conservative audience have gone mainstream. First, there was the <a href="https://www.vox.com/internet-culture/357813/hawk-tuah-girl-meme-tiktok-explained">viral video</a> of a woman from Tennessee being asked about oral sex outside of a bar — a very bro-y Girls Gone Wild-inspired genre that’s emerged on TikTok — and offering a memorable onomatopoeia. There’s also the viral Florida-based father-and-son duo A.J. and Big Justice, who do food reviews at Costco. With the exception of Big Justice’s sister and mother — who’s literally referred to as the “Mother of Big Justice” in videos — this expanded universe of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Pl6Dg0YB3w">Costco Guys</a>” is made of white men and boys from Florida and New Jersey rating foods in a cartoonishly macho manner.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They&#8217;re not explicitly expressing MAGA as a value, but they&#8217;re trafficking in spaces that have been less visible in recent years: rural and suburban enclaves, featuring white, heterosexual, male, and even &#8220;bro-y&#8221; talent that was out of vogue in recent history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One can assume that the current MAGA-coded fabric of mainstream culture correlates with a generation of young people who identify as <a href="https://www.theupandup.us/p/gen-z-teens-conservative-shift-gallup-data">more conservative than their parents</a>, although Penney says the relationship between pop culture and politics is a two-way street. While the media can reflect growing opinions and interests of the moment, it can also be used to shape it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Pop culture doesn&#8217;t just emerge out of nowhere,” says Penney, who wrote the book <em>Pop Culture, Politics, and the News</em>. “We’re seeing attempts to shape the culture that are increasingly coming from the conservative media ecosystem.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Conservatives carved out a space for themselves at the movies&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In March, Ben Shapiro’s media company the Daily Wire released its first theatrical movie, the “satirical” documentary <em>Am I Racist?, </em>which <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/how-the-daily-wire-engineered-box-office-hit-am-i-racist.html">earned $4.5 million</a> its opening weekend. Currently, it’s the highest-grossing documentary of the year along with a handful of other conservative nonfiction films including the Catholic documentary <em>Jesus Thirsts: The Story of the Eucharist</em>, the Dinesh D&#8217;Souza-directed <em>Vindicating Trump</em>, and the creationist movie <em>The Ark and the Darkness</em> all making the <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/market/2024/genre/Documentary">top 10 list</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">2024 saw other movies from conservative studios and right-wing producers make notable financial gains. Despite overwhelmingly negative reviews, the Ronald Reagan biopic, <em>Reagan</em>, starring Dennis Quaid, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2024/09/14/reagan-defies-negative-reviews-and-holds-strong-in-box-office-top-5/">broke into the top 5 at the box office</a> when it premiered in August, doing particularly well with <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/box-office-summer-labor-day-deadpool-wolverine-afraid-1236073792/">older, white, and Southern audiences</a>. Over the summer, the Christian media company Angel Studios also released the pro-adoption movie <em>Sound of Hope: The Story of Possum Trout</em>, marketed by Daily Wire+. While it made significantly less money than its <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/2023/">2023 predecessor <em>Sound of Freedom</em></a><em>, </em>which had a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/19/1188405402/qanon-supporters-are-promoting-sound-of-freedom-heres-why">vocal fan base of QAnon supporters</a><em>,</em> its nearly $12 million worldwide earnings are still a massive accomplishment for a small Christian film with no movie stars. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the performance of these movies has not bred the same immediate concern of something like <em>Sound of Freedom</em>, it does provide a potential incentive for major studios to start courting a movie-going crowd that’s felt alienated by mainstream Hollywood.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/2571_FP_00623B-3587x1500-d3275b2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=10.064120434904,0,79.871759130192,100" alt="Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones looking at a tornado in the 2024 film Twisters. " title="Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones looking at a tornado in the 2024 film Twisters. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Actors Glen Powell and Daisy Edgar-Jones in the 2024 film &lt;em&gt;Twisters&lt;/em&gt;. | Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Amblin Entertainment" data-portal-copyright="Universal Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, and Amblin Entertainment" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Warner Bros has yet to produce its own <em>Sound of Freedom</em>, but we’ve seen hints that Hollywood is interested in movies that at least appeal to white, Southern, and conservative audiences. American nostalgia bait came to the fore in the summer blockbuster <em>Twisters</em>. The Oklahoma-set film with a star-studded, country-infused soundtrack did <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/box-office-twisters-middle-america-red-states-1236016845/">particularly well in Southern cities and theater chains</a> in middle America, outperforming initial estimations. While it’s probably most accurate to describe the film as decidedly apolitical with some patriotic markers, it does see the white, blond savior (played by Glen Powell) emasculate the movie’s other male main character, Latino storm chaser Javi (Anthony Ramos). Powell happened to produce another piece of Americana, <em>Blue Angels</em>, a look at the US Navy’s flight demo squadron, and the fourth highest-grossing documentary of 2024. He also co-starred with Sweeney in <em>Anyone but You</em>, a film released at the end of 2023 that crossed the <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/box-office/sydney-sweeney-glen-powell-anyone-but-you-crosses-200-million-poor-things-nears-100-million-mark-1235922019/">$200 million</a> mark in early 2024.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Penney says corporations will try new strategies and pander to different audiences, as they’ve done with Marvel and Disney’s diversity pushes in recent years, based on what they think will benefit them financially. They’re not really thinking about political impact. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That was very much the reality of capitalism at work,” Penney says. “[Disney] was trying new strategies, not because they were really, truly convinced that they were going to save the world through expanding diversity, but they were getting a sense that that&#8217;s what the audience wanted. It was a response to Me Too and Black Lives Matter and things that actually resonated with our culture to a degree.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This pendulum swing from the sort of diversity-focused art that dominated pop culture during the Obama years to what we’re seeing now is hardly unprecedented. Specifically in music, country’s popularity as a genre has historically corresponded with a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/911-country-music-songs-1221348/">push in right-wing politics,</a> from the jingoist anthems following 9/11 to “Okie From Muskogee” during the Nixon years. Pop culture has also seen movies with conservative and/or religious themes, from<em> American Sniper</em> and <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>, break the box office. If this current moment tells us anything, it’s that we’re stuck in an ouroboros of shifting political values and corporate interests. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Suffice to say, it’s not a question of whether we’ve been here before but whether we’re paying attention to what these signals all mean. With an honest look at our media landscape, were the results of the election truly that surprising?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On November 5, Americans elevated a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/14/23958866/trump-vermin-authoritarian-democracy">reactionary authoritarian</a> to the presidency — again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/3/22211657/washington-post-trump-call-georgia-secretary-state-raffensperger-recording-find-votes">attempting to overturn an election</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23513019/january-6-committee-report-trump-2020-election-insurrection">fomenting an insurrection</a>, becoming a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/353111/trump-trial-verdict-criticisms-wrongly-convicted">convicted criminal,</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/podcasts/372206/springfield-ohio-pets-haitian-immigrants-conspiracy">baselessly accusing</a> an immigrant community of eating house pets, Donald Trump not only won a second lease on the White House, but he did so with a plurality of the popular vote — while Republicans took control of both congressional chambers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Liberals may be feeling a sense of déjà vu. But this is not 2017 all over again. It is something worse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past eight years, Trump has remade the Republican Party in his image. In Congress, his intraparty critics have almost all <a href="https://rollcall.com/2019/10/28/trump-has-gop-critics-in-congress-but-many-of-them-arent-sticking-around/">decamped for the private sector</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/26/gops-awkward-2016-flip-flops-trump-make-comeback-2024/">knelt to kiss his ring</a>.

This time around, he and his allies have <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/13/trump-loyalists-2024-presidential-election">assembled a cadre</a> of loyalists, some of whom have won <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/384320/trump-cabinet-white-house">Cabinet nominations</a> (alongside some more conventional Republicans). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, conservatives have consolidated their grip on the Supreme Court, slashed <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hispanic-voters-trump-florida-texas-pennsylvania-democrats-3637d86dede99e36f35d725afabdcba1">the Democrats’ advantage with Hispanic voters</a>, and fortified the GOP’s strength with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-return-power-fueled-by-hispanic-working-class-voter-support-2024-11-06/">the non-college-educated electorate</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/383565/2024-election-results-kamala-harris-loss-democrats-future">realignments</a> that threatened the Democratic Party’s capacity to wield federal power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this amounts to a catastrophe for anyone who values liberal democracy, egalitarian economic policy, and social equality for all marginalized groups. As someone who has spent the past decade advocating for more expansionary immigration policies, a larger social safety net, criminal justice reform, and decarbonization, it is difficult to see my country embrace a man who evinces contempt for all of those causes. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the face of this calamity, Democrats must develop a clear-eyed understanding of how they got here and chart a plausible path back to the country they want to live in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This newsletter — <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/385161/the-rebuild-newsletter-sign-up-democratic-party-liberals-progressives">The Rebuild</a> — aims to aid in that project. In weekly installments, I’ll try to offer some insight into how Democrats lost their national majority, as well as what we — people who care about advancing progressive change — must do to become more effective moving forward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Answering those questions will require Democrats to analyze their predicament with open minds. If we seek ideologically comforting explanations for the party’s problems — rather than empirically sound ones — the coalition will march deeper into the wilderness.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, in the wake of Vice President Kamala Harris’s loss, virtually <a href="https://samharris.substack.com/p/the-reckoning">every</a> <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/188110/biden-white-working-class-ira-trump">Democratic</a> faction has produced its share of motivated reasoning. In future newsletters, I plan to take issue with some centrists’ analysis of the party’s difficulties. But today, I want to explain why I worry that the left is allowing wishful thinking to cloud its vision of political reality. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since November 5, some progressives have drawn a sweeping lesson from Trump’s second victory: Harris’s loss proves Democrats gain little from “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/nov/08/obama-era-democrat-party-future">moderation</a>” or “<a href="https://x.com/mattduss/status/1854169589237874891">centrism</a>” and must “<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/democratic-party-elite-responsible-catastrophe/">embrace radical policies</a>” in order to compete. I admire many of the writers making this argument. But their confidence in this narrative strikes me as wildly unfounded.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is true that Harris <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/367389/dnc-2024-kamala-harris-policies-trump-dangerously-liberal">pivoted to the center</a> on border security, crime, and, to a lesser extent, economics. There are plenty of sound arguments — both moral and political — against Democrats moderating on specific issues. Yet it’s hard to see how anyone could be confident that Harris lost because she moderated, much less that her loss proved that moderation is electorally counterproductive as a rule.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To name just a few reasons for doubting those premises:</p>

<ul>
<li>Harris actually <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/08/2024/a-very-simple-prescription-for-democrats-just-wait">did better</a> where both she and Trump held campaign rallies and aired TV advertisements than she did in the rest of the country. Thus, if Harris’s problem was her moderate messaging, it is odd that she won a higher share of the vote in the places that were more exposed to that messaging, despite the fact that such areas were also inundated by pro-Trump ads. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In a September <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651692/voters-choice-character-leadership-skill.aspx">Gallup</a> poll, 51 percent of voters described Harris as “too liberal,” while just 6 percent deemed her “too conservative.”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Some of the Democratic Party’s biggest overperformers in the 2024 election — the down-ballot candidates that ran furthest ahead of Harris with their constituents — were moderates: <a href="https://x.com/tahrajirari/status/1854908246534111278">Jon Tester, Amy Klobuchar,</a> <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-elections/maine-us-house-district-2-results">Jared Golden</a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-washington-us-house-3.html">Marie Gluesenkamp Perez</a>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Harris had been <a href="https://voteview.com/person/41701/kamala-devi-harris">a liberal senator</a> and took many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/us/politics/kamala-harris-2020-positions.html">left-wing positions</a> during the 2020 Democratic primary. The Trump campaign <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-paints-harris-ultra-liberal-1st-rally-biden/story?id=112253634">attacked her relentlessly</a> on that basis. It’s hard to see how one could determine that it was Harris’s moderate messaging, rather than her progressive background, that was more damaging to her prospects. What we know, however, is that her opponent’s political advisers sought to highlight the latter, not the former. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The Biden-Harris administration was, by many progressives’ own account, the most <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics">left-wing White House on domestic policy</a> in generations, and Trump’s team portrayed Harris <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4871309-trump-campaign-harris-biden-presidential-debate/">as an extension of that administration</a>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Across the wealthy world, parties that presided over inflation have <a href="https://x.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1854485866548195735?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1854485866548195735%7Ctwgr%5Ed9a3106d708552ae9f36cdc67a77f45ec428ac3a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fpolitics%2F2024%2F11%2F07%2Felection-world-inflation-harris-trump%2F">been losing at the ballot box</a>, irrespective of their political leanings, a fact that raises doubts about whether any grand ideological lesson can be drawn from Harris’s defeat.</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My aim here is not to argue that Democrats must pivot to the center on all issues. I don’t think they should. I do think that the party needs to moderate its image nationally, if only to better compete for Senate control. But I’m still gathering my thoughts on how precisely they should pursue that task and will elaborate on them in future newsletters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, my point is simply that there is little basis for confidence that Harris lost due to excessive moderation, or that Democrats would benefit electorally from becoming broadly more left-wing. The fact that many on the left nevertheless evince such certainty is therefore disconcerting.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being progressive, in the best sense of that term, means putting the interests of the most vulnerable above one’s own comfort — whether material or ideological. And right now, America’s most disempowered constituencies have a strong interest in Democrats ousting reactionaries from power. If the party substitutes wishful thinking for unblinkered analysis, they will have a harder time accomplishing that task.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 New York City Marathon <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/media-center/press-release/2024_1104_tcsnycmbythenumbers">officially</a> broke the world record for marathon finishers, with 55,646 runners from all over the world crossing the finish line earlier this month. It’s a far cry from the race’s humble beginnings: In <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/tcsnycmarathon/getinspired/marathonhistory">1970</a>, just 55 runners completed the race, which then only entailed laps around Central Park.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The record-breaking participation in this month’s run came as no surprise to me, because I have seen the growing popularity of marathon running in my own life: This year, I cheered on six of my friends from the sidelines. And last year, I even ran the race myself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past few years, my circle of 20- and 30-somethings has transitioned away from boozy late nights in favor of early-morning meetups at the track. Suddenly, I have strong opinions on brands of gels and shoes and run belts. I spend my weekends cheering at all sorts of races. Running culture has taken over our lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As it turns out, we’re part of a global trend toward marathon participation <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/16/briefing/boston-marathon-finish-times.html">in recent decades</a> — a phenomenon that’s been helped along further by the pandemic-era <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/sports/running-exercise-coronavirus.html">running boom</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><iframe title="Why everybody&#039;s running marathons now" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/11NwWyVUrpfKTNs6QZsJsI?utm_source=oembed" allowfullscreen allow="clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture;"></iframe></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Twenty-somethings like me are a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2024/04/running-marathon-quarter-life-crisis/678156/">big reason</a> for the jump: 15 percent of NYC Marathon finishers in 2019 were in their 20s. Just four years later, in 2023, they made up 19 percent, according to the Atlantic. At the Los Angeles Marathon those same years, the proportion of 20-something runners grew from 21 percent to 28 percent.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That growth prompted the Atlantic to dub running “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2024/04/running-marathon-quarter-life-crisis/678156/">the new quarter-life crisis</a>.” And while “crisis” usually connotes some sort of negative spiral, my cohort’s new running obsession could be viewed less as a symptom of all that&#8217;s gone awry for our generation and more as a positive rebellion against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why so many young people are taking up distance running</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Marathons in general are simply becoming more inclusive: Women’s participation was first allowed in the 1970s and has only recently started to achieve <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/280440/marathon-finishers-by-age-and-gender-united-states/">something like parity</a> with men’s. There are also more finishers <a href="https://www.runninginsight.com/closing-the-gap">of color</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-515098618.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.774624818864,100,78.450750362273" alt="In a black-and-white photo, a woman and a crowd of men in athletic clothes and race numbers are running along a paved course, with one man in a jacket, pants, and tie, running alongside trying to stop the woman." title="In a black-and-white photo, a woman and a crowd of men in athletic clothes and race numbers are running along a paved course, with one man in a jacket, pants, and tie, running alongside trying to stop the woman." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The director of the Boston Marathon tries to grab a lone female runner, Kathrine Switzer, in 1967 when she ran the then all-male race. | Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But for the Gen Z demographic, another key driver is just … the way life is right now. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A lot of them started running during the pandemic. A lot of them were starting careers at that time, were graduating from college and maybe didn&#8217;t have a real graduation, maybe didn&#8217;t have these normal adult milestones,” says journalist Maggie Mertens, the author of the book <em>Better Faster Farther: How Running Changed Everything We Know About Women</em>. “They see homeownership and marriage and kids as kind of out of reach —&nbsp;further out of reach than even the millennial generation did.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That adds up to a lot of uncertainty. And what helps manage uncertainty if not a four-month, intensive training plan that calls for four to six training runs a week covering hundreds of miles, plus cross-training and stretching?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Marathon season is largely over,&nbsp;which means it’s an ideal time to start thinking about whether you want to run one next year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, a disclaimer: I grew up a competitive swimmer and a softball player. The pandemic shut down all my favorite workout classes and basically forced me to lace up my running shoes. I’m not an especially fast runner, and I’m not setting out to break any world records. I mainly think of it as a great way to move my body, hang out with my friends, and challenge myself to go a little farther than I could yesterday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If that sounds like you, read on for advice on what I learned from training as a 20-something<strong>,</strong> and things to know if you&#8217;re hoping to start training, too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Training can be a way to add structure to your life</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I found that preparing for the New York City Marathon functionally required the spreadsheet-ification of my life: Sunday, long run. Monday, rest. Tuesday, 4 miles. Wednesday, 8 miles. You get it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the most strenuous, highest-mileage training weeks, I sometimes felt something like despair, but mostly the box-checking helped bring a sense of predictability, even when my work or personal life was up in the air. It also created new milestones where others —&nbsp;home-buying, having a kid — felt out of reach.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I visited the 2024 Chicago Marathon Expo a few weeks ago to find out more for the <em>Today, Explained</em> podcast, and several 20-something runners had similar experiences to share.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You can have the worst day in the world, but the benefit of that is that you turn around and you’re like, ‘Well, at least I got my miles in,’” Taylor-Nicole Limas, 28, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some, like Mitchell Rose, 23, training is a way to impose structure on adult life. “It kind of gives me the end-of-the-semester feel, like you’re working towards something, whereas work gets very monotonous. I’m three months into my full-time job now, and I came to the realization like, ‘Oh, this just never ends.’”&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2182698991.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729673135785,100,78.540653728429" alt="A young woman in running gear smiles and puts a hand to her face, surrounded by other runners." title="A young woman in running gear smiles and puts a hand to her face, surrounded by other runners." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Runners react after crossing the finish line of the 2024 New York City Marathon on November 3. | Sarah Stier/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Sarah Stier/Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Use running to push you to finally make big lifestyle changes</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rigor of training mandates shedding bad habits and adopting healthy ones, too. I personally found that I had to add a fourth meal to my day — just to make up for the thousands of calories burned on my training runs. I also gave up alcohol and cut back on late nights in an effort to reduce the likelihood of feeling bad on long runs (which only sometimes worked).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other runners told me they had to make similar commitments.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m not proud of it, but I used to vape,” Pascale Geday, 26, told me at the expo. “I’m no longer vaping. I feel like it’s made me a better athlete.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All these little adjustments add up to a much bigger change, says <a href="https://clas.ucdenver.edu/psychology/kevin-masters-phd">Kevin Masters</a>, a professor of psychology at University of Colorado Denver and a former marathoner himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You really orient your day — which turns into your weeks, which turns into months — around this event,” he <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/11NwWyVUrpfKTNs6QZsJsI?si=07d6aedf31d349f8">told</a> <em>Today, Explained</em>. “That&#8217;s kind of an orienting principle for your life.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Training for a race can also be a way to find community</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The boom in marathon participation comes amid what the surgeon general is calling a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">loneliness epidemic</a>, marked by decreased participation in community organizations, faith organizations, and recreational leagues over several decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This phenomenon is especially apparent among 20- and 30-somethings, who are becoming known as the “<a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/how-bars-are-adapting-to-gen-z-the-homebody-generation?srsltid=AfmBOoqhWsa2FeTDSgIOeUL5wJ642EQ4vm4cSHjvqp8uAmV3GlxY06BY">homebody generation</a>.” One <a href="https://sociologicalscience.com/download/vol_11/august/SocSci_v11_553to578_updated.pdf">recent analysis</a> found that they spend, on average, about two more hours per day at home than previous generations did.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Where people used to gain some of their purpose and meaning in life and feel affiliated with others,” from community organizations, Masters said, those “aren&#8217;t really doing it for the younger folks as much.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Running just might: Run-club participation is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/briefing/berlin-marathon.html">so high</a> that it’s become a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mattslyon/video/7367758453437123882?lang=en">meme</a>, and social media abounds with running <a href="https://www.instagram.com/savannahsachdev">influencers</a> and content.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I have started a group chat with a bunch of first-time marathoners,” Limas told me. “I&#8217;m like, ‘Hey, we&#8217;re all running the marathon. … We&#8217;re all women. Why not just, when we’re stressed out, text each other?’ And they&#8217;ve all become friends because of this group chat that I started.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, run clubs aren’t everyone’s cup of tea. Rose told me that he hadn’t had luck when he tried them out. “I have a long-term girlfriend. I don&#8217;t need to go to a run club because they&#8217;re usually looking for other things other than a good workout.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead, he said, he prefers to run with just one friend: “Having someone that you can knock on the door and be like, ‘Let&#8217;s go for a run right now,’ and they’ll more often than not drop everything and be like, ‘Yeah, let&#8217;s go. Like, let&#8217;s have a great time together.’ That is another level of our friendship that I don&#8217;t think would be there otherwise.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sifting through the wreckage of the 2024 campaign, one thing that can’t be said about the Democrats is that they put too little effort into winning over Latino voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you looked closely, it was clear that the national party, the Biden-Harris campaign, and Democratic-allied groups were determined to avoid a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/pandemics-assault-latino-political-power/615979/">repeat of 2020</a>, when Joe Biden’s campaign was widely accused of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/9/9/21420401/latino-vote-democrats-joe-biden-chuck-rocha">neglecting Latino voters</a>, starting its outreach too late, and making tone-deaf appeals — all mistakes that allowed Donald Trump to make historic gains with these communities despite Biden ultimately prevailing in the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This time around, the Biden (and then Harris) campaign were determined to do everything right. They hired and elevated <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/5/4/23708278/joe-biden-kamala-harris-2024-election-latino-voters-julie-chavez-rodriguez">top Latino consultants, strategists</a>, and <a href="https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/27/president-joe-biden-reelection-campaign-team-el-paso-rep-veronica-escobar-added/70155654007/">elected</a> <a href="https://www.wispolitics.com/2023/biden-harris-2024-announces-campaign-national-advisory-board/">officials</a>. They opened field offices and hired staff in heavily Latino parts of swing states like Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, and Pennsylvania as early as the spring. They reached out to voters on <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trump-vs-harris-is-the-whatsapp-campaign.html">WhatsApp</a>, a private messaging app used as a form of social media by many Latino and immigrant communities; sent surrogates to Spanish-language radio stations; and microtargeted advertising to Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Mexican American voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Spanish and bilingual ads ran continuously on TV, radio, and online starting in March. And those ads moved beyond an explicit focus on identity, instead talking up policy and accomplishments like Medicare’s cap on insulin prices, the expansion of health care coverage, and job creation during the post-Covid economic recovery.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The hope was that this earlier, smarter, more tailored campaign would help reverse a few trends that were obvious for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23873568/biden-polling-black-latino-voters-2024-election-trump">most of 2023</a> and 2024: that Latino voters were deeply unhappy with the status quo, were not enthusiastic about Biden’s reelection, and were questioning their loyalty to the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s clear now that this strategy was not enough. Though it will take months to get more granular data, county-level results and exit polls do indicate a rightward shift by Latino voters across the country that contributed to Trump’s victory. To be clear, it appears<strong> </strong>Democrats still won a majority of Latino voters — but the harsh reality for Democrats is that Trump once again managed to improve his standing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t mean that Democrats should <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/06/democrats-latino-vote-trump-00187991">throw out</a> the playbook for campaigning with Latino voters. Calls for a hard pivot to the <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/a-common-sense-democrat-manifesto">right</a> on cultural issues, or outright resignation about a permanent racial realignment — as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/trump-black-latino-voters-interview/680588/">some</a> of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/09/trump-latino-hispanic-vote-election">conventional</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/11/latinos-vote-trump/680596/">wisdom</a> floating around since the election suggests — are premature. Republicans simply cannot be sure these gains will stick around without Trump on the ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are oddly two contradictory takeaways given what we know so far: Democrats can assure themselves that they ran a pretty good campaign to win back Latino voter support. On a deeper level, however, they missed a more fundamental disconnect between the party and the voters, particularly the working class, that a textbook campaign simply couldn’t fix.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Two takeaways from the election</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two distinct points to take away from November 5.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, campaigning does still matter. The <a href="https://x.com/williamjordann/status/1856076168111194180">national trend</a> of Trump posting better margins of support in non-battleground states than in swing states applied to Latino voters as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Where Democrats campaigned heavily for Latino votes, Harris saw a smaller drop in support than in places where her campaign did not focus its efforts — meaning that the campaign’s Latino ground game, spending, and organizing shouldn’t be discounted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second point cuts the other way: There is a much deeper problem with Democrats’ appeal to Latino voters, one that will take time to repair. Nationally, Democrats like Biden and Harris were just not trusted as working-class champions by many Latino voters, who are still overwhelmingly working class and not college educated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The memories of economic hardship during the pandemic (for which Trump largely escaped blame) and the inflationary period that followed never went away, and weren’t properly addressed by either Biden or Harris during the campaign. Combined with an overriding <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents">anti-incumbent mood</a> that permeated electorates globally this year, Democrats were almost certain to do worse with Latino voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There were some exceptions. For example, Republican Senate candidate did not do as well as Trump did among Latino voters, and Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who won the Arizona Senate race in a state Harris lost, particularly overperformed, winning by 2 percentage points a state that Trump won by 5. But the larger point holds: Democrats lost ground with Latino voters, and analysts point to their inability to appeal to the working class as a culprit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It starts with the credibility of the message,” Chuck Rocha, a Mexican American strategist who advised Bernie Sanders’s 2020 primary campaign and helped with both Biden general election campaigns, told me. “People like to say that Bernie Sanders was this, or that — the thing that made Bernie Sanders great was that he had always said the same thing, so he was credible. People see bullshit now in politicians. They want someone that&#8217;s credible whether they like him or hate him.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rebuilding that credibility will be essential if Democrats are to reverse their fortunes not just with Latino voters, but with a wide swathe of the electorate.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Democrats never really figured out how to regain Latinos’ trust on the economy</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In retrospect, the storyline of the Latino electorate was fairly consistent. Poll after preelection poll told the same story: These voters were most concerned about the economy, and they were as likely as white voters to say they either missed the policies and economic conditions of the Trump era, or trusted Trump more than either Biden or Harris to deliver relief.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the heart of this feeling was a disconnect between what voters meant by “the economy” and what many national Democrats, including Biden and Harris, were talking about on the trail. Latino voters, troubled by inflation earlier in the Biden presidency, largely meant “prices should be lower,” while Biden and Harris mostly talked about job creation, slowing inflation, and gradually rising wages.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was true as early as November 2023, when polling from the Democratic research firm Blueprint found that Latino voters cared most about lower prices and least about “creating more jobs” — which was especially problematic because, as Blueprint also found, Latino voters <a href="https://blueprint2024.com/uncategorized/bidenomics-poll-deck-nov/">more than any other racial group</a> thought that more employment was Biden’s priority.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Add to this dynamic the fact that it was Latino and Black Americans who experienced <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23992436/black-latino-americans-economy-biden-democrats-voters-poll-inflation">uniquely traumatizing</a> financial roller-coasters during the post-Covid period — seeing their wealth and financial prospects <a href="https://www.vox.com/22600143/poverty-us-covid-19-pandemic-stimulus-checks">rise</a> during the pandemic because of <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/13/23500066/pandemic-savings-inflation-recession">government aid</a> only for <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/8/10/23824742/real-wages-economy-inflation-no-money">rising costs of living</a> to wipe out many of those gains before wages began <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/11/20/23964535/labor-market-employment-inflation-sentiment-economy-bad-polls">to grow again</a> — and you can see where the Biden administration’s credibility gap emerged.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden economic message was focused on trying to sell a positive economic success story — and there were indeed data and legislation they could point to tell that story. But according to Camille Rivera, a senior adviser for Voto Latino and founder of the Puerto Rican civic organization La Brega y Fuerza, the campaign’s foregrounding of top-line indicators — the GDP, the improving consumer price index, the low unemployment rate, and investments in infrastructure and manufacturing, among others — could not sway voters who still saw vivid reminders of peak inflation in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/11/8/23951098/economy-inflation-prices-job-market-sticker-shock">cost of food and household essentials</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We were talking about the economy in macro forms, but people were not feeling it. They were just not feeling it,” Rivera said. “My father would be like, ‘Hey, did you see this? I just bought these potato chips. There&#8217;s like 50 percent air in these potato chips, and the price is higher.’ We kept saying, ‘But the economy is great. Look at the stock market!’ That to me was many of our flaws.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The “identity force-field” showed cracks</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over time, this disconnect may have taken a toll on the <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/22/latino-drift-democrats-poll">overall “party of the working class” brand</a> of the national Democratic Party. And there’s perhaps no better sign of this than in polling specifically focused on one dynamic that tends to bind Latinos to the Democratic Party: the question of which party best “cares for people like you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s that feeling that has tended to root most Latino voters in the Democratic camp, even if these voters don’t necessarily agree with every social position, economic or immigration policy, or cultural value that the party takes on —&nbsp;a kind of “identity force-field,” as Equis, a Democratic research firm focused on Latino voters, calls it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the aftermath of the 2022 midterms, Equis found evidence that those feelings were still fairly strong. In those midterms, there were conflicted or swing voters who turned out, and who, because of that warm association with the Democratic Party, pulled the lever for Democratic candidates. There were also Latino voters who ended up voting for Republicans — but who still harbored warm feelings toward Democrats anyway. Generally, Equis polling found, Democrats were still the party viewed as “better for Hispanics” and which cared “about people like you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But as Carlos Odio, an Equis co-founder, warned at the time of that report, there was a good chance swing Latino voters could drift in 2024 if “there is a major shift in the issue environment, imbalanced campaigning, or a weakening of identity bonds.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And that seems to be what happened. The signs of weakening identity bonds were there. The Biden campaign fizzled out. And the economy, as well as a rise in the salience of immigration, put national Democrats on the defensive with both Latino voters and the general electorate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By October 2024, after Biden drove down positive perceptions of the party among Latinos prior to his late July exit, Harris had managed to recover the party’s footing. Her campaign strategy didn’t change tremendously, but polling showed Latino voters returning to the Democratic candidate, albeit not at the same rates that they had voted for Biden in 2020. By the close of the campaign, Harris was viewed as being “better for Hispanics” and “people like you.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the <a href="https://www.weareequis.us/research/latino-update-october-2024">Democratic advantage</a> had shrunk from two years before. The force field was weak. And by then, it was too late for the Harris campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats now face a challenge: to reassess how they talk about the economy, about class, and about material conditions in a way that can connect with the electorate. There’s a tendency among some in the party —&nbsp;strategists, commentators, and elected officials —&nbsp;to either want to throw out the way they’ve run outreach to Latino voters or to deny that they have a problem at all (and blame “disinformation” or <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/11/12/trump-latino-voters-unidos-us">offer counterintuitive data</a> to bolster that thinking). Democratic campaign operations in 2024 were not useless, but if the party is to have a shot in 2028, the work to rebuild credibility with working-class Latinos starts now.</p>

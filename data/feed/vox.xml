<p class="has-text-align-none">In the days since Donald Trump’s victory became official, one of the great debates about Trumpism has come roaring back: To what extent can his rise to power be seen as a product of America’s divisions over race?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One side, focusing on Trump’s <a href="https://x.com/coldxman/status/1854930189907624371">gains with Black and especially Hispanic voters</a>, argues that it makes little sense to believe his victory was primarily a product of racism. The other, noting that both groups still went for Harris in absolute terms, argues that the election results still must be viewed <a href="https://x.com/nhannahjones/status/1856083231663370417">as primarily revolving around the country’s racial divide</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A closer look at the data suggests that both takes are wrong — or, at least, require more nuance. Trump’s victory was and wasn’t about race, as his winning coalition included many different groups with many different motivations. Understanding which kind of voter mattered, and in what ways, is crucial to getting the racial politics of 2024 right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can safely say it’s difficult to explain the shifts in the electorate between 2020 and 2024 by claiming that voters were motivated by Trump’s incendiary racial rhetoric. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just that Trump gained with minorities; it’s that he gained with nearly everyone, winning new votes in places with all sorts of different kinds of voters. To explain such a consistent national shift to the right, you need to look to factors that unite the population rather than divide it. This is why the best post-election analyses have given pride of place to inflation and anti-incumbent sentiment, two factors that appear to be present across many different groups in the American electorate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, we can also say that race played an essential role in Trump being atop the Republican ticket in the first place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was a moment in 2021, right after January 6, when it looked as though Trump might finally be exiled from the Republican Party. The reason the GOP elite blanched is the same reason why Trump walked to victory in the 2024 primary: He has a devoted, unshakeable fan base among Republican primary voters. The research is crystal clear that many of these voters really are motivated by racial antagonism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2024 election saw a Trump base motivated in large part by fear of a changing America entering into a coalition with many economically minded voters who represent that change. Both groups voted for Trump, albeit for very different reasons. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a coalition might represent a fundamental realignment in American politics, the “multiracial working-class conservatism” <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/23982907/trump-democrats-republicans-working-class-voters-latino-black-voters">long dreamed of by Republican strategists</a>. Or it could represent a temporary alliance that will be severely tested, perhaps even sundered, when the reality of Trump’s policy agenda becomes clear to the electorate. At this point, we don’t know.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But we can at least say, with confidence, that Trump’s racial support in 2024 is more complicated than simplistic analyses might lead you to believe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">No, race and racism didn’t cause the 2024 pro-GOP swing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The argument for a race-focused explanation of 2024 focuses primarily on the well-documented fact that America is politically polarized by race. Trump won a clear majority of white voters while Harris won a massive majority of Black voters. In this argument, what happened in 2024 was a reflection primarily of anti-Blackness, directed at the first Black woman to run for president, by a country in the grips of reactionary racial panic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[The] vote was about perceived loss of status,” <a href="https://x.com/nhannahjones/status/1855308936632475649">Nikole Hannah-Jones</a>, the New York Times’s star reporter on racial issues, posted on X. “What elected Trump was demographic anxiety — his campaign ran explicitly on it, explicitly! — and so many people whose job it is to dispassionately deal with facts still do not want to deal with that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’m sympathetic to the underlying theory of Trump’s support. So sympathetic, in fact, that I argue <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reactionary-Spirit-Insidious-Political-Tradition-ebook/dp/B0CMQB8S94">in my book</a> that it’s the most important reason he rose to power back in 2016. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if what we’re trying to explain is the top-line election result — why enough voters shifted from Biden to Trump to swing the election — it’s only of limited utility. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Were the big shifts between 2020 and 2024 to be driven by the kind of backlash Hannah-Jones is describing, you’d expect a specific kind of uneven distribution in the vote patterns. You’d expect Trump to run up the score with white voters in rural red areas while facing some backlash from Latino and especially Black voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not what happened. Trump improved on his 2020 performance with nearly every demographic group across the country. His biggest improvements came in heavily non-white and urban areas — precisely the places where a race-focused explanation would expect him to do the worst. And white voters swung inconsistently, rather than as a rule.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Currently, the best way to understand these demographic swings comes from county-level reporting of results. You can look at the tallies in counties that are heavily made up of one group or another, compare to other counties and previous election results, and draw some (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy">limited</a>) inferences about what’s happened. In the coming months and years, we’ll get more useful data on individuals through databases like the Catalist voter file; but for now, we have to make do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the US electorate is still polarized by race — Harris won a clear national majority of non-white voters and Trump won a clear majority of white voters — racial polarization declined significantly in 2024. A tally by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/06/us/elections/trump-america-red-shift-victory.html">the New York Times</a> found that Trump improved his margin in Latino-majority counties by 13.3 percentage points, Native American-majority counties by 10 points, and Black-majority counties by 2.7 points. (Note that these numbers will likely change as data from California, an extremely slow-counting state, continues to trickle in).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The pro-Trump shift across majority-minority counties was strikingly consistent. Texas border counties with largely Mexican American residents <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/11/06/donald-trump-near-sweep-texas-border-counties/">lurched hard toward Trump</a>; Starr County, which is 97 percent Latino, moved <a href="https://x.com/MWatkinsTrib/status/1854372802507272461">a staggering 75 points in his direction</a> between 2016 and 2024. There were also notable 2020-2024 swings in <a href="https://x.com/MappingFL/status/1854342028500558126">Florida counties with different Latino populations</a>, like Miami-Dade (where half the Latino population is Cuban) and Osceola (home to many of the state’s Puerto Rican residents).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s possible that some of these minority voters themselves had racially conservative — maybe even racist — views. This is an election that featured <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/373655/mark-robinson-black-latino-right-wing-extremism">Mark “I’m a Black Nazi” Robinson</a> as the GOP candidate for North Carolina governor. Previous research has found that Trump’s support among non-whites is correlated with <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/9F91070372394D892BF11E1FFC0C619F/S1537592724000847a.pdf/div-class-title-embracing-the-status-hierarchy-how-immigration-attitudes-prejudice-and-sexism-shaped-non-white-support-for-trump-div.pdf">support for existing social hierarchies</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don’t want to deny that this is part of the story of the 2020-2024 shift; it’s the kind of thing that will be hard to prove or disprove until we have much more granular data. But the evidence we have suggests anti-minority sentiment among minorities isn’t the entirety, or even the biggest part, of what happened. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a few good reasons to think this is so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the uniformity of the shift. We didn’t see some minority groups swing toward Trump and some toward Harris; we saw a <em>uniform</em> move toward Trump across different racial minority demographics. Black people, Native Americans, Arab Americans, <a href="https://x.com/carlosodio/status/1856370229548286293">Latinos</a>, and Asians of all national origins — every single one moved in a pro-Trump direction. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, we can look to the white population as a benchmark. If whites shifted toward Trump even more dramatically than minorities, that would be consistent with an election whose shifts were triggered by activated racial resentment. If whites shifted by a smaller margin or even moved toward Harris, then that would suggest something else is at work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we saw looks more like the latter. While Trump saw overall gains among white voters, they were smaller than his gains among Latinos and far more uneven, with Harris actually making gains in certain demographics and areas. An analysis of Michigan results by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/06/the-key-swings-that-handed-trump-the-white-house-a-visual-analysis">the Guardian</a>, for example, found that “the only areas in Michigan in which there were swings to the Democrats were areas with a higher proportion of white voters.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two other demographic trends worth looking at: urbanicity and college education.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2181325963.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Exterior of Penn Station in New York City with a large sign on it that reads “President Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden.”" title="Exterior of Penn Station in New York City with a large sign on it that reads “President Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden.”" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Generally speaking, <a href="https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/old_uploads/2019/06/Wilkinson-Density-Divide-Final.pdf">urban counties</a> and counties with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/10/education-polarization-diploma-divide-democratic-party-working-class.html">large numbers of college graduates</a> tend to have larger percentages of residents with left-wing views on cultural issues like race than rural and lower-educated ones. In a racial backlash election, you’d expect those counties to swing in Harris’s direction while rural and less college-educated ones moved more into Trump’s column.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet in 2024, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/06/trump-big-cities-popular-vote/">urban counties actually swung harder to Trump than rural counties</a> (where he was already extremely strong and thus had only limited room to make gains). Meanwhile, counties with relatively high levels of residents with college graduates (35 percent or over) swung to Trump by relatively similar margins as counties with fewer college graduates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, these results are not the final word. When doing county-level analysis, political scientists often warn against something called the ecological fallacy — making inferences about individual residents of an area based on the characteristics of the whole. It could be, for example, that a chunk of racist voters who live in majority-minority counties, cities, and highly educated areas swung hard for Trump in 2024.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, that seems far less probable than a well-documented alternative explanation: that Trump’s big gains come from a combination of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383208/donald-trump-victory-kamala-harris-global-trend-incumbents">anti-incumbent sentiment</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/hey-stupid-it-wasnt-just-economy-it-was-inflation-2024-11-06/">a voter backlash to inflation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The 2024 election might not be about race, but Trumpism is</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As much as I think the 2024 results weren’t primarily about race, some observers are taking this observation way too far by arguing that it disproves the idea that racism drives any part of Trump’s support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Trump has run three times. Each time he has gotten a higher share of the black and Hispanic vote than the last. Indeed, he has done better with these demos than any Republican in 50 years. The ‘racism’ theory of Trump&#8217;s appeal belongs in the graveyard of [political science],” the prominent commentator <a href="https://x.com/coldxman/status/1854930189907624371">Coleman Hughes posted on X</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is far too sweeping. “Trump’s appeal” is not just one thing; like any candidate, he appeals to different voters for different reasons. Changes in minority vote totals can’t tell us, for example, why white support for Trump remains so durable inside the Republican Party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a crucial question because it explains why Trump is on the ballot this time despite real intra-party resistance. And the most important answer, though by no means the only one, has to do with the Republican base’s reactionary racial politics.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After January 6, 2021, Republican elites seem poised to kick him to the curb. Yet when Republicans had a chance to act — by voting to convict him in the Senate and declare him ineligible for public office — they didn’t. They backed down for the same reason Trump would romp through the primary despite a robust-on-paper challenge from Gov. Ron DeSantis: Republican voters love him. They love him so much that any Republican who openly defied him would face serious political blowback, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/23899688/2024-election-republican-primary-death-threats-trump">potentially even physical harm</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are many, many reasons why Trump has secured such a hold on the GOP; it is not fair to term all of his base presumptive racists. And yet, the uncomfortable fact remains: The evidence that Trump’s support stems primarily from the racial resentments of the Republican base is overwhelming.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike the limited county-level analyses of the 2024 election results, research tying Trump’s base support to racial factors has been able to employ complete and granular datasets on individual voters. Scholars have used gold-standard political science tools, things like <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3692784">natural experiments</a> and <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0002716218811309">regression analyses of massive national surveys</a>. They’ve tested theories of Trump support against competing explanations, like <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psq/article-abstract/133/1/9/6848138">economic deprivation</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/explaining-the-trump-vote-the-effect-of-racist-resentment-and-antiimmigrant-sentiments/537A8ABA46783791BFF4E2E36B90C0BE">general anti-system sentiment</a>, and overwhelmingly found that racial issues provide the stronger explanation. They’ve even uncovered good evidence that <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2007747117">the turn against democracy among Republicans</a>, including the willingness to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240626103609id_/https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4BB3B6F641B41D8B63D152F9779C64CE/S2056608523000338a.pdf/div-class-title-who-buys-the-big-lie-white-racial-grievance-and-confidence-in-the-fairness-of-american-elections-div.pdf">accept the Big Lie about the 2020 elections</a>, is primarily concentrated among Trump supporters who hold high levels of anti-minority resentment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nothing about the 2024 results should cause us to doubt these well-established findings. Instead, they should give us an opportunity to take a more sophisticated understanding of the role race plays in the Trump coalition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the longstanding and well-documented body of research on Trump and race, it is fair to say that Trumpism as a political movement is in large part driven by white racial anxiety. It is one factor among many driving Republicans to back Trump to the hilt, but clearly the most influential.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This suggests the 2024 Trump coalition is an alliance between a critical mass of racially resentful whites and others with very different motivations, including minority voters who physically represent the social change his base despises. Some Trump general election supporters were racially resentful; others were simply fed up with inflation and the Biden-Harris administration. For others, it might be some combination of both.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is how politics works in a large and diverse country. People who differ, perhaps even hate each other, can end up voting for the same candidate for different reasons. And if we fail to appreciate that, we will fail to truly grasp what just happened and what it might mean about America’s future.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Donald Trump announced that he <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/matt-gaetz-attorney-general?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_google">intends to nominate Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)</a> to serve as his attorney general. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz is a longtime Trump loyalist, who will likely be tasked with remaking the Department of Justice. The department has traditionally adhered to strong norms against interference by the president; Trump and his allies have been explicit <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381094/trump-second-term-2024-election-justice-department-civil-rights">in arguing that should change</a>. Trump has also repeatedly called for legal action against his political enemies, including <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/21/nx-s1-5134924/trump-election-2024-kamala-harris-elizabeth-cheney-threat-civil-liberties">promising</a> to “appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” in 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Enforcing those sorts of threats would fall to Gaetz, if he is confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before being nominated to be attorney general, Gaetz was probably best known for two things. One is his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/1/23898555/kevinn-mccarthy-speakership-matt-gaetz">longstanding feud with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy</a> (R-CA), who was eventually ousted in no small part because of Gaetz. The other is the string of sexual misconduct allegations. Gaetz denies these allegations, and the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">dropped its investigation into them in 2023</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Gaetz does end up running that same department, he’ll be in a uniquely powerful role. He would be tasked with overseeing all federal prosecutions, providing legal advice to the president and the Cabinet, and would have the final say on any legal stance that the United States takes in court. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of greater significance perhaps is the fact that Gaetz would have enormous authority over who is prosecuted, who is allowed to get away with committing federal crimes, and who might be targeted for politically motivated prosecutions in an authoritarian administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has repeatedly promised “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">retribution</a>” against his Democratic rivals. And his fellow Republicans on the Supreme Court ruled last July that he can order the Justice Department to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/366855/supreme-court-trump-immunity-betrayal-worst-decisions-anticanon">bring politically motivated prosecutions without consequence</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the first Trump administration, Trump reportedly wanted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/11/20/18105462/trump-clinton-comey-order-justice">order the Justice Department to prosecute</a> his former political opponent Hillary Clinton and former FBI director James Comey, but was dissuaded from doing so by White House Counsel Don McGahn. Gaetz’s strong support for Trump, by contrast, makes it seem he’s much less likely to resist such an order.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Just who is Matt Gaetz?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz has a law degree, and he <a href="https://gaetz.house.gov/about">did previously practice law in northwest Florida</a>. He’s been a representative since 2017, and became known both for stunts on the House floor — like wearing a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/gaetz-coronavirus-gas-mask/index.html">gas mask</a> to protest masking policies during the coronavirus pandemic — as well as his <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/23/20929023/house-republicans-impeachment-stunt-trump">staunch support for Trump</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2021, it was revealed that Gaetz was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html">the subject of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The allegations arose out of his relationship with Joel Greenberg, a former county-level tax collector who was<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html"> sentenced to 11 years in prison</a> by a federal judge in 2022. Greenberg pled guilty to a wide range of crimes, including underage sex trafficking, wire fraud, identity theft, and conspiring to defraud the federal government. Judge Gregory Presnell, who sentenced Greenberg, said that he’s “never seen a defendant who has committed so many different types of crimes in such a relatively short period.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to CNN, Greenberg also “cooperated extensively with the Justice Department’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/01/politics/joel-greenberg-sentencing/index.html">sex-trafficking probe into GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz</a>.” Among other things, Greenberg reportedly told investigators that he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4751778-matt-gaetz-joel-greenberg-sex-trafficking-florida/">witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl</a>. (Gaetz in 2021 issued a blanket denial of the allegations via a statement from his office, writing: &#8220;No part of the allegations against me are true.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a general rule, sex offenses such as soliciting prostitution are handled by state-level prosecutors, as the Constitution only gives the federal government <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3801442224983217117&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">limited authority over sex crimes</a>. The US Justice Department can get involved, however, in narrow circumstances. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Justice Department’s investigation into Gaetz looked into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/us/politics/matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation.html">whether he had sex with this teenager and paid for her to travel with him</a>. It is a <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2423#g">federal crime</a> to transport someone across state lines, with the intent that they engage in prostitution or “illicit sexual conduct.” The most serious violations of this statute carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/doj-decides-not-charge-rep-matt-gaetz-sex-trafficking-investigation-rcna70839">eventually decided not to charge Gaetz</a>. Its reasons for declining to do so have not been made public, but the lack of charges does not necessarily clear him of the allegations. Meanwhile, a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/witness-tells-house-ethics-committee-matt-gaetz-paid/story?id=111217102">House ethics investigation into Gaetz remains ongoing</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to ABC News, one woman told the House committee investigating Gaetz that <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/witness-tells-house-ethics-committee-matt-gaetz-paid/story?id=111217102">the member of Congress paid her for sex</a>. Others have said they were paid to attend parties that Gaetz also attended, where attendees used drugs and had sex. Again, Gaetz has denied any misconduct.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of yet, it’s unclear whether a majority of senators will vote to confirm Gaetz as attorney general. But there’s some evidence that many Republicans will be turned off by the sex crimes allegations against Gaetz, and by his generally poor reputation on Capitol Hill. In 2023, for example, Sen. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) said that “<a href="https://x.com/mkraju/status/1709765049051381761">there’s a reason why no one in the [Republican] conference defended</a>” Gaetz after seeing some of the evidence against him.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sen. Markwayne Mullin on Matt Gaetz: “We had all seen the videos he was showing on the House floor … of the girls that he had slept with. He’d brag about how he would crush ED medicine and chase it with an energy drink so he could go all night.”<br><br>Gaetz responds: “This is a lie” <a href="https://t.co/h55hj0ag29">pic.twitter.com/h55hj0ag29</a></p>&mdash; Manu Raju (@mkraju) <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1709765049051381761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2023</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As <a href="https://x.com/ezraklein/status/1856798502484910130">New York Times columnist Ezra Klein writes</a>, Trump’s decision to nominate Gaetz should be read as an effort to gauge whether Republican senators will permit him to take absurd and dangerous actions. “These aren&#8217;t just appointments,” Klein writes of Gaetz and Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth, “They&#8217;re loyalty tests. The absurdity is the point.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has begun naming members to his White House team, offering a strong signal about the direction he’ll take on important issues, including foreign policy, immigration, and climate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s picks have included multiple immigration hardliners, underscoring his commitment to proposals like <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportation</a>, as well as a number of staffers who hold adversarial stances toward China and Iran and supportive positions of Israel. Notably, most of Trump’s selections are longtime loyalists who could put up less opposition to his policy proposals than staffers did during his first administration. And he’s selected a number of people who have little to no experience in the subject matter they’ll be overseeing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first administration, many of Trump’s Cabinet members oversaw significant changes to the executive branch, including Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who were critical to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/">curtailing worker protections</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos">attempting massive cuts to education spending</a>, respectively. Trump has indicated he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-wins-second-term-policies-de3dcf0f173b42602b258042fd7aaafb">wants to go further</a> and <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1855692242981155259">move faster this time around</a> and that he wants to ensure he’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/default/donald-trump-staffs-up-second-term-only-maga-loyalists-need-apply-2024-11-11/">surrounded by like-minded staff</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is a rundown of the people Trump has named and the roles these appointees could play.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-961479096.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.727373918039,100,78.545252163922" alt="Tom Homan, sitting behind his name plate and speaking." title="Tom Homan, sitting behind his name plate and speaking." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Tom Homan, ex-ICE acting director. | Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="tom-homan-former-ice-acting-director-has-been-named-border-czar"><strong>Tom Homan</strong>, <strong>former ICE acting director, has been named “border czar”&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Homan was acting ICE director during the first Trump administration and oversaw the implementation of the family separation policy during his tenure from 2017 to 2018. He’s also long backed <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-makes-tom-homan-father-of-family-separation-in-charge-of-mass-deportation/">Trump’s desire to deport unauthorized immigrants</a>, previously noting that if invited to join the administration, he intended to “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump">run the biggest deportation operation this country&#8217;s ever seen</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan worked for ICE during former President Barack Obama’s administration as well, and has also served as a police officer and Border Patrol agent. He’s been in lockstep with Trump on implementing punitive immigration policies and called <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-homan-trump-border-czar-what-to-know/">for ICE to deport a wide range of unauthorized immigrants</a>, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation">those who don’t have criminal histories</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,&#8221; Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump">wrote in a Truth Social post.</a> “There is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The “border czar” is not an official role that requires Senate confirmation;&nbsp;the secretary of homeland security is the actual Cabinet official overseeing the border. However, Homan appears poised to have a major say over policy and will weigh in on proposals at both the northern and southern borders, according to Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Homan’s efforts in the first Trump administration and his commitment to sweeping deportations this term indicate that the president-elect is fully focused on his promise to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">remove a large number of unauthorized immigrants from the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2182126474.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107" alt="Stephen Miller speaking at a Trump rally. The crowd behind him hold “Trump will fix it” signs." title="Stephen Miller speaking at a Trump rally. The crowd behind him hold “Trump will fix it” signs." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Stephen Miller. | Christian Monterrosa/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Christian Monterrosa/Bloomberg via Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="trump-policy-aide-stephen-miller-has-been-named-deputy-chief-of-staff-and-policy-adviser"><strong>Trump policy aide Stephen Miller has been named deputy chief of staff and policy adviser</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373479/stephen-miller-mass-deportation-camps-trump-agenda">Miller is a staunch Trump loyalist and policy adviser</a> who pushed many of the harshest immigration policies during the president-elect’s first term. He has advocated for a travel ban and family separations in the past, and he’s a chief architect and booster for the idea of the mass deportations Trump has promised this term as well. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/politics/stephen-miller-trump-administration/index.html">Miller has said of deportations.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has not yet formally announced the appointment, though Vice President-elect JD Vance has already <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1856004703672324263">posted his congratulations to Miller</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is another political appointment that doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but the role is set to focus heavily on providing Trump with policy guidance — likely focused on immigration, given Miller’s expertise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Between this appointment and Homan’s, Trump has made clear that his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">promised mass deportations</a> will be one of his top policy goals when he retakes office.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162179387.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.742099199347,100,78.515801601307" alt="Kristi Noem speaks at a podium in a white jacket" title="Kristi Noem speaks at a podium in a white jacket" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. | Scott Olson/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Scott Olson/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="kristi-noem-has-been-tapped-for-homeland-security-secretary"><strong>Kristi Noem has been tapped for Homeland Security secretary</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>The two-term South Dakota governor is a longtime Trump loyalist and was on <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/9/24048591/trump-vice-president-pick">his shortlist for the vice presidency</a>. Ahead of Trump making his VP selection, Noem became enmeshed in scandal after she <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24145840/kristi-noem-puppy-killing-book-trump-vp">admitted to shooting her dog, Cricket, because of behavioral issues</a>, generating overwhelming backlash.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, Noem was known for refusing to<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/27/opinion/kristi-noem-south-dakota-coronavirus.html"> impose a mask mandate</a> during the pandemic, and for refusing to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/11/politics/kristi-noem-cpac-south-dakota-governor-covid-mandate/index.html">implement statewide business closures</a> despite public health concerns. Noem was also <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/politics/kristi-noem-tribal-lands-ban/index.html">banned by multiple Native American tribes </a>from visiting tribal lands in the state due to claims she’s made that they’ve been infiltrated by cartels.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On immigration, Noem has often echoed Trump’s hardline rhetoric suggesting that <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kristinoem/reel/DCIV983xbLS/?hl=en">many unauthorized immigrants are criminals</a>, and she backed his travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>Secretary for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is a significant role given the agency’s notable&nbsp;purview over the administration’s policies at the southern border. DHS includes key subagencies like ICE as well as Customs and Border Protection. The secretary role requires Senate confirmation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Noem is one of several picks that signal Trump’s investment in punitive immigration policies this term such as mass deportation — and aggressive border security.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1167012750.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.8120095111577,100,80.375980977685" alt="Pete Hegseth, a man in a suit and tie" title="Pete Hegseth, a man in a suit and tie" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Fox News host Pete Hegseth | John Lamparski/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="John Lamparski/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="pete-hegseth-has-been-tapped-for-secretary-of-defense"><strong>Pete Hegseth has been tapped for secretary of defense</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>A co-host of Fox News’s <em>Fox and Friends Weekend</em> show, Hegseth is a veteran who previously served in Afghanistan and Iraq but who has little senior national security experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth has taken controversial positions in the past, including advocating for soldiers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/21/media/fox-news-pete-hegseth-trump-pardon-war-crimes/index.html">who’ve committed war crimes to be pardoned</a> and stating that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/pete-hegseth-defense-cabinet-trump-women-b2646223.html">women shouldn’t be fighting in combat</a>. He’s written multiple books about his military service, often criticizing the military for <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e2e8d60f-7ac3-40a2-a252-5b7ab81622af">“wokeness” and prioritizing diversity</a> — and has said he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-nominate-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-2024-11-13/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-will-nominate-fox-news-host-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary-2024-11-13/">supports firing senior leaders who advance these ideas</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth has expressed his support for Israel as well as an adversarial stance toward Iran. In addition to working as a television host, Hegseth previously led the advocacy group Concerned Veterans for America, which is funded by the Koch brothers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Pete is tough, smart and a true believer in America First,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-pete-hegseth-defense-secretary/">Trump wrote in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The Secretary of Defense oversees the military, including the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This person serves as a key adviser to the president on international conflicts and military policy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past officials in this role have often struggled to work with Trump, with five people cycling through it during his first term — and many of them criticizing his ability to govern.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth would need to be confirmed by the Senate for this role.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Hegseth’s nomination seemed to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-hegseth-defense-secretary-pentagon-2d8030921ecef933778cf92afd40ec72">take many lawmakers and military leaders off guard</a> given his dearth of experience. His inflammatory positions about wokeism in the military and pardoning of war crimes have also spurred concerns.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hegseth is among the many Trump picks poised to be strong defenders of Israel, and who advance a more traditionally conservative viewpoint on foreign policy.&nbsp;Like Trump, however, Hegseth has expressed skepticism of NATO and the contributions of US allies. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1251946266.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729331207725,100,78.541337584551" alt="John Ratcliffe, a man who looks like Steve Carell, speaks " title="John Ratcliffe, a man who looks like Steve Carell, speaks " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Former Rep. John Ratcliffe | Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Al Drago/Bloomberg/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="john-ratcliffe-has-been-selected-as-cia-director"><strong>John Ratcliffe has been selected as CIA director</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>The former director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term, Ratcliffe is another longtime loyalist who’s being elevated in the upcoming administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Previously, Ratcliffe helped aid Trump’s efforts to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/john-ratcliffe-cia-director-trump.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/john-ratcliffe-cia-director-trump.html">investigate President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden </a>in the House, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/30/politics/ratcliffe-unverified-intelligence-concerns/index.html">and was also criticized</a> for declassifying intelligence about Russian operations at Senate Republicans’ behest while serving as the director of national intelligence. Members <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/13/politics/intelligence-agencies-john-ratcliffe/index.html">of the intelligence community told CNN</a> that his past experience and track record made him a less disruptive choice compared to others who may have been considered.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A House lawmaker prior to his time in the first Trump administration, Ratcliffe was known for his fierce defenses of the president-elect during his first impeachment proceedings. He’s also been a vocal critic of the Chinese government’s intelligence operations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The CIA director oversees the United States’s intelligence-gathering operations around the globe. This official plays a key role in advising the president and overseeing how this intelligence is used.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Ratcliffe is the latest Trump loyalist to be installed in a pivotal position and questions remain about how committed he might be to opposing the president-elect. Trump has called for <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-has-promised-to-overhaul-u-s-intelligence-setting-up-collision-course-with-spy-agencies">an overhaul of intelligence agencies</a> that he’s viewed as challenging his authority.</p>

Marco Rubio. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="marco-rubio-has-been-tapped-for-secretary-of-state"><strong>Marco Rubio has been tapped for secretary of state</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Rubio is serving his third term as a Florida senator and is known for his adversarial position toward China, Iran, and Cuba, as well as his focus on <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/florida/story/2020/08/03/how-marco-rubio-runs-trumps-latin-america-policy-1972792">US-Latin American relations</a>. He currently sits on the Senate Intelligence and Foreign Relations Committees, and though he’s taken foreign policy positions aligned with Trump’s isolationist rhetoric lately, he has previously supported international alliances and interventionist approaches.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rubio has also expressed strong support for Israel, and emphasized he isn’t interested in a ceasefire in the region until the country has defeated Hamas. He’s backed Ukraine aid in the past as well, though he opposed more recent packages and has urged an end to the war.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rubio has also shifted considerably on certain issues like immigration: Early in his career, he was a chief proponent of immigration reform in the Senate, including a path to citizenship for <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-answers-for-his-failed-2013-immigration-plans-again/">unauthorized immigrants,</a> and his rhetoric has grown more hardline and similar to Trump’s over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“He will be a strong Advocate for our Nation, a true friend to our Allies, and a fearless Warrior who will never back down to our adversaries,”&nbsp;<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4988992-trump-rubio-secretary-state/" data-type="link" data-id="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4988992-trump-rubio-secretary-state/">Trump said in a statement.</a> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is one of the most powerful in the administration and key to shaping US foreign policy. The secretary of state is the chief envoy of the US in other countries, and offers counsel for how to approach different international relationships. Secretaries of state are also often dispatched to help mediate conflict. The role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Like the selection of Rep. Mike Waltz for National Security Adviser,<strong> </strong>Rubio’s naming suggests that Trump may be open to a more traditionally conservative and aggressive approach to foreign policy.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="michael-waltz-has-been-picked-as-national-security-adviser"><strong>Michael Waltz has been picked as national security adviser</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>A member of Congress from Florida, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-picks-rep-mike-waltz-former-green-beret/story?id=115753630">Waltz is also a former Green Beret</a> who served in Afghanistan. He worked on foreign policy under President George W. Bush, and has sat on the Armed Services, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs Committees in the House. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While on the Hill, Waltz became known for his hardline, aggressive stances on China and Iran and for being a vocal critic of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The national security adviser is a key foreign policy aide to the president; historically, they provide advice on both military and diplomatic matters. The role does not require Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has clashed heavily with past individuals in this role including John Bolton, who has said<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bolton-excoriates-trump-fresh-introduction-his-memoir-2024-01-30/"> he’s “unfit” to serve as president again.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Waltz is one of multiple hawkish foreign policy picks Trump has made. That suggests the Republican Party wing that advocates for intervention and action on the world stage — rather than the restrained, more isolationist faction — may get a large platform in a second Trump administration.</p>

Elise Stefanik of New York. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="elise-stefanik-has-been-tapped-for-un-ambassador"><strong>Elise Stefanik has been tapped for UN ambassador</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Once a moderate, Stefanik — currently part of Republican House leadership — has become a vocal Trump loyalist in recent years as her New York district shifted right.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/19/20966940/elise-stefanik-impeachment-hearing-donald-trump-adam-schiff">Stefanik first burst onto the national stage</a> as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, grilling witnesses as part of Trump’s first impeachment proceeding in the lower chamber in 2019. More recently, she went viral for her questioning of college presidents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/elise-stefanik-republican-antisemitism-hearings.html">during a hearing on antisemitism</a> and their handling of student protests over Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a top House Republican, Stefanik has amplified Trump’s 2020 election denials and hewed so close to the president-elect that she was once on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/9/24048591/trump-vice-president-pick">shortlist for the vice presidency</a>. Stefanik is also known for her <a href="https://www.vox.com/21262150/house-republican-women-candidates">efforts to recruit and support more Republican women</a> for House seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s taken a pretty standard conservative stance on foreign policy: Stefanik has been a prominent supporter of aid to Israel while balking at continuing support for Ukraine. She backed early tranches of Ukraine aid but joined other Republicans in arguing that more recent aid could be better applied domestically. Stefanik has previously questioned aid to the United Nations, including to its Relief and Works Agency, which has been vital to providing humanitarian aid to Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Elise is an incredibly strong, tough and smart America First fighter,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-chooses-rep-elise-stefanik-serve-us-ambassador-united-nations-rcna179558">Trump said in a statement about the role</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The UN ambassador serves as a vital envoy for US interests; given the country’s financial support for the body and its role on the UN Security Council, the ambassador has major influence regarding how the organization utilizes its resources and who serves in its leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last year, UN officials have been increasingly critical of Israel’s attacks on Gaza as thousands have died, health care systems have been assaulted, and famine has struck. As ambassador, Stefanik could criticize these positions and call for defunding UN relief programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>The pick suggests that the Trump administration could once again ramp up its disagreements with the United Nations, after attempting to <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/02/trump-stealthily-seeks-to-choke-off-funding-to-un-programs/">curb funding for certain UN initiatives</a> in Trump’s first term. At that time, the administration also pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/us/politics/trump-israel-palestinians-human-rights.html">citing its criticisms of Israel</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stefanik’s naming could also underscore <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-ukraine-russia-war-threatens-cut-aid-election-2024/">the president-elect’s skepticism</a> of additional aid to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162539091.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida | Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Tierney L. Cross/Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="matt-gaetz-has-been-tapped-for-attorney-general"><strong>Matt Gaetz has been tapped for attorney general</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is:</strong> Gaetz is a conservative firebrand and longtime Trump supporter who is known for his disruptive presence in the House. Previously, he was a chief antagonist of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and has threatened multiple government shutdowns over concerns that conservative demands weren’t being met on issues like immigration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Gaetz has sat on the Armed Services and Judiciary committees in the House and has also faced an investigation over his alleged involvement in sex trafficking of a minor. (The DOJ ultimately declined to charge him.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s announcement of the position centered heavily on Gaetz’s supposed willingness to root out alleged bias toward the president-elect at the agency. “Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System,” <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113477516524300359" data-type="link" data-id="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113477516524300359" rel="nofollow">Trump wrote in a statement on Truth Social</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role:</strong> The attorney general heads the Department of Justice and oversees the enforcement of federal laws. The DOJ conducts investigations of possible violations of these laws and is also responsible for holding federal officials accountable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Past Trump Attorney General  Jeff Sessions was previously forced out when the president-elect disagreed with <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46132348" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46132348">his handling of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation. </a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Gaetz is another Trump loyalist who’s poised to help use the agency in a way that aids the president-elect’s aims. Republicans have long complained of targeting and bias at the DOJ and that could prove to be a major focus of his time there. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1464161119.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729399246567,100,78.541201506867" alt="Lee Zeldin sits quietly at a desk with his hands folded." title="Lee Zeldin sits quietly at a desk with his hands folded." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Former US Rep.

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="lee-zeldin-tapped-as-environmental-protection-agency-administrator"><strong>Lee Zeldin tapped as Environmental Protection Agency administrator</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Zeldin is a former Republican House lawmaker who ran a failed campaign for the New York governor’s seat in 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zeldin did not previously sit on committees focused on environmental policy in the House, and&nbsp;focused on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1134203429/new-york-governor-election-results-kathy-hochul-lee-zeldin">crime and inflation during his gubernatorial run</a>. That year, he came within a notably close margin of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul as a Republican running in a traditionally blue state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zeldin has said some of his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-taps-lee-zeldin-lead-environmental-protection-agency-rcna179658">first priorities</a> will be to “roll back regulations that are forcing businesses to be able to struggle,” and to work on US “energy dominance.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The EPA is responsible for crafting policies that protect clean water and air, and also plays a major role in approving regulations to combat climate change. The administrator position is a Senate-confirmed role.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Trump promised to take a very different approach to the environment than the Biden administration, including by <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">exiting international climate agreements</a> and focusing on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy">expanding fossil fuel production</a>. Zeldin’s nomination suggests those promises will be a priority, as will <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy">rescinding Biden-era environmental protections</a> that curbed carbon emissions for businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="elon-musk-and-vivek-ramaswamy-will-co-lead-a-new-department-of-government-efficiency"><strong>Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will co-lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency</strong>”</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who Musk is: </strong>A massive and vocal Trump advocate, Musk has used his platform on X (formerly known as Twitter) to boost the president-elect as well as misinformation about numerous topics, including noncitizen voting and election fraud.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musk is known for leading several companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, and for increasingly becoming part of Trump’s inner circle. Musk has also faced <a href="https://qz.com/tesla-elon-musk-ev-factory-wage-law-violations-lawsuit-1851391624">allegations of labor violations at his companies</a>, and for past attention-seeking efforts, like trying — and failing — to help a group of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/7/18/17576302/elon-musk-thai-cave-rescue-submarine">Thai youth trapped in a cave in 2018</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’ll lead something called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, alongside former presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. The moniker for the department is a nod to the cryptocurrency Musk once endorsed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies &#8211; Essential to the &#8216;Save America&#8217; Movement,&#8221; Trump wrote in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2180840404.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,13.791470441211,100,72.417059117577" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who Ramaswamy is: </strong>A 2024 presidential candidate and biotech entrepreneur, Ramaswamy framed himself as an outsider trying to challenge the establishment during the GOP primary.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ramaswamy also aligned himself closely with Trump during his run, and has made much of his platform dedicated to combating “wokeism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The Department of Government Efficiency doesn’t currently exist and a new government agency can’t be created without the approval of Congress. It’s likely that this agency will exist outside of the government instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s purportedly focused on slashing bureaucracy, government spending, and waste.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>This position speaks to the prominence that Musk has achieved in Trump’s orbit, and Ramaswamy in far-right circles, despite a lack of government and policy experience.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2182885052.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729339346038,100,78.541321307924" alt="Susie Wiles shaking hands with Trump onstage at a Trump-Vance rally." title="Susie Wiles shaking hands with Trump onstage at a Trump-Vance rally." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Susie Wiles, Trump’s senior national adviser. | Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Jabin Botsford/Washington Post via Getty Images" />
<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none" id="susie-wiles-has-been-named-chief-of-staff"><strong>Susie Wiles has been named chief of staff</strong></h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Wiles, a longtime Florida campaign operative, helped run Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state and was a Trump senior national adviser in 2024. She’s heavily credited for the success he had during the Republican primary in 2024 and had previously aided Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during his gubernatorial run in 2018 prior to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/09/ron-desantis-susie-wiles-reaction-00188586">falling out between the two</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wiles has also been a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-susie-wiles-00188391">corporate lobbyist</a> and worked with a spectrum of Republicans in the past, including former Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Florida Sen. Rick Scott.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Susie is tough, smart, innovative … universally admired and respected,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-susie-wiles-chief-of-staff/">Trump said in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The chief of staff is effectively a gatekeeper who helps shape the president’s priorities and offers policy counsel. The position is the most prominent political appointee in the White House and is not Senate confirmed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/trump-fascist-john-kelly/index.html">Trump’s former Chief of Staff John Kelly</a> has been a major Trump critic, describing him as a “fascist” who favors a “dictator approach.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Wiles <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/who-is-susie-wiles-the-woman-behind-trumps-historic-return-to-the-oval-office">has been credited</a> with professionalizing Trump’s campaign operations and reining in some of the chaos that has marked his past operations. That said, his campaign was still <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/30/trump-poisoning-the-blood-racism">rife with racist remarks</a> that echoed authoritarians as well as frequent lies <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-black-nabj/index.html">about former Vice President Kamala Harris’s </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mveuxlccbV0">policies and identity</a>. Kelly has said he <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-susie-wiles-chief-staff-campaign/">attempted to restrain the president</a> during his first term, though it was still plagued by in-fighting and tumultuous policies on everything from climate to immigration.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the warm blue waters of the Solomon Islands, an island chain in the South Pacific, lies one of the world’s largest sea creatures.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roughly the size of two basketball courts, it’s neither a whale nor a giant squid. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is a single piece of coral.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Wednesday, a team of researchers and filmmakers exploring the Solomon Islands revealed that they found what they claim is the world’s largest individual coral colony. The coral, a communal organism comprising millions of animals called polyps, is 34 meters wide and 32 meters long — and&nbsp;so large it can be seen from space. A typical coral reef is made of many different coral colonies, most of which are genetically distinct, whereas this is just one individual.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In new photos shared by the research team, the coral, a species known as Pavona clavus, looks like a lumpy brown mound covered in knobs. Closer views reveal bits of yellow, green, and purple. Given its size and the slow speed at which corals grow, this individual is likely several centuries old.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/06-NGSPS2024SOL_MSF_2532Nat_Geographic.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="A huge mound of coral underwater, with a scuba diver looking small beside it." title="A huge mound of coral underwater, with a scuba diver looking small beside it." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The mega coral is so large it dwarfs the diver alongside it. | Manu San Félix/National Geographic Pristine Seas" data-portal-copyright="Manu San Félix/National Geographic Pristine Seas" /><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/14-NGSPS2024SOL_MSF_2599Nat_Geographic.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736575241132,100,78.526849517736" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Close-up views reveal all kinds of sea life growing on and around the coral. | Manu San Félix/National Geographic Pristine Seas" data-portal-copyright="Manu San Félix/National Geographic Pristine Seas" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s a dream to see something unique like this,” Manu San Félix, an underwater photographer and marine biologist who first saw the coral last month in the Solomon Islands, told Vox. “When Napoleon was alive, this thing was here.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">San Félix discovered the coral&nbsp;while filming near an island called Malaulalo for an ongoing National Geographic expedition. The expedition, a collaboration with the Solomon Islands government, is part of National Geographic’s Pristine Seas project, which aims to help countries establish more marine parks,&nbsp;in part by documenting sea life. Malaulalo is mostly uninhabited and its waters are largely unexplored, according to Dennis Marita, a member of the Po&#8217;onapaina Tribe of Ulawa. The tribe oversees Malaulalo’s marine territory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is something huge for our community,” Marita, who’s also the director of culture at the Solomon Islands’s ministry of culture and tourism, said in a press conference Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No other coral in the public record is larger than this one, though it’s possible that there are bigger colonies in remote stretches of the ocean that have yet to be discovered. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-77776-7">previous record-holder</a> for the world’s largest coral was a colony in American Samoa that was roughly 22 meters wide.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Many of the world’s coral reefs are remote and not well explored,” Stacy Jupiter, executive director of marine conservation at the Wildlife Conservation Society, who was not involved in this expedition, told Vox. Humans have only surveyed <a href="https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/world-oceans-day/reason-1.html">about 5 percent</a> of the planet’s marine realm, she mentioned. “So it is not surprising at all that we continue to make new discoveries, even of large creatures,” Jupiter said.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/31-NGSPS2024SOL_1024_DAY-STRINGOUT.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282" alt="A large underwater mound with a scuba diver looking small swimming above it." title="A large underwater mound with a scuba diver looking small swimming above it." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Manu San Félix, National Geographic Pristine Seas" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">“Beacon of hope”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The discovery comes at a time when coral reefs around the world are vanishing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Climate change is warming the oceans, and warm water kills corals. Coral gets its color and much of its food from symbiotic algae that live inside polyps. When seawater gets too warm, that algae disappears, and the coral turns white —&nbsp;or “bleaches.” Bleached corals are essentially starving to death.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Coral reefs globally are facing <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/global-coral-bleaching-event-expands-now-largest-record-2024-10-17/">the most extensive bleaching crisis on record</a>. Three-quarters of the world’s coral reefs have experienced enough ocean heat to cause bleaching since early 2023, <a href="https://coralreefwatch.noaa.gov/satellite/research/coral_bleaching_report.php">according to</a> the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Many <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23868423/florida-coral-reef-bleaching-heat-wave-climate-change">corals have died</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, new research suggests that <a href="https://iucn.org/press-release/202411/over-40-coral-species-face-extinction-iucn-red-list">more than 40 percent</a> of hard corals —&nbsp;those that build reefs, like the recently discovered colony in the Solomon Islands — are at risk of extinction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a problem, to put it lightly. Reefs dampen waves that hit the shoreline during hurricanes, they are home to a significant portion of commercial fish that people eat, and they are the engine of tourism economies in many coastal regions. Hundreds of millions of people depend on coral reefs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps unsurprisingly, the National Geographic team discovered a lot of dead coral in the shallows of the Solomon Islands, likely due to excessive heat in the ocean, said Molly Timmers, a marine ecologist and the expedition’s lead scientist. That was discouraging, she said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the face of that loss, this discovery was a “beacon of hope,” Timmers told Vox. “It’s like, holy crap! This is amazing!”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Large coral colonies provide homes for marine critters like crabs, snails, and small fish. More importantly, they seed the ocean with baby corals when they spawn, or reproduce,&nbsp;helping damaged sections of reef recover.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plus, this particular coral may be resilient to stress, including excessive marine heat. The research team estimates that it’s between 300 and 500 years old, meaning it’s lived through multiple global bleaching events and survived. Unlike some of the coral closer to shore, this individual — which was more than 10 meters deep — appeared healthy, perhaps because it was in deeper, cooler water or because it has some built-in genetic tolerance to heat. So the spawn it produces could be resilient too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Anything old is really good at surviving,” said Maria Beger, a marine ecologist at the University of Leeds, who was not involved in the discovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Discovering a hulking colony of coral is not, by itself, all that impressive, said Beger. To support marine life and withstand threats like climate change, it’s more important that reefs have a diverse array of coral species in all shapes and sizes, rather than one big one. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“At the same time, if a report like this gets people excited about coral reefs,” she said, “maybe that’s a good thing.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The discovery could also help the Solomon Islands conserve their waters more effectively, Marita, of the ministry of culture and tourism, told Vox. While his tribe has been informally conserving Malaulalo for a decade on its own, he said, the island would benefit from an official marine protected area recognized by the Solomon Islands government. Marita has been campaigning to make that happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This will certainly boost the conservation initiative that we have been working on,” he told Vox, referring to the discovery. “This mega coral will help bring much-needed visibility and recognition from the government and other stakeholders. This is really a gain for us.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some <a href="https://blog.phillyhistory.org/index.php/2011/08/the-boulevard/">110 years ago</a>, a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oldimagesofphiladelphia/photos/roosevelt-boulevard-philadelphia-pa-circa-1929/1173930726003197/?paipv=0&amp;eav=Afalm-woospaGzSHhjFwCRd8TsK3u_YGSewLU0Dm9ax3uWGI1qCynOKD9Y8ewa7m8qQ&amp;_rdr">picturesque</a> new road known as Roosevelt Boulevard <a href="https://billypenn.com/2017/02/06/how-roosevelt-boulevard-became-the-most-dangerous-road-in-philadelphia/">began ferrying vehicles</a> across the nascent but burgeoning neighborhoods of North and Northeast Philadelphia. At first, traffic was light, but it rapidly thickened as car ownership rose and the surrounding area developed. By the 1950s, when the boulevard expanded to meet the new Schuylkill Expressway, it was lined with row houses and shops. Today, what was initially a bucolic parkway has become a traffic-snarled, 12-lane thoroughfare snaking its way through neighborhoods that house <a href="https://www.phila.gov/media/20210513121401/Route-for-Change-program-executive-summary.pdf">1 in 3 Philadelphians</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is, by all accounts, a mess.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dubbed the “corridor of death,” Roosevelt Boulevard has been named the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philadelphia-roosevelt-boulevard-speed-cameras-safety-study/">most dangerous street in the city</a> (and among <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/video/philadelphias-roosevelt-blvd-among-most-dangerous-roads-in-us/#10">the most dangerous in the nation</a>). In 2021, 24 crashes resulting in deaths or serious injuries <a href="https://www.itskrs.its.dot.gov/2023-b01760" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.itskrs.its.dot.gov/2023-b01760">took place</a> there. Residents “want to get across the street to the pharmacy to get their medication or get across the street to the supermarket,” Latanya Byrd, whose niece and three nephews were killed in a crash on the boulevard in 2013, said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3LxEpAIQMM&amp;t=16s">video</a> produced by Smart Growth America. “It may take two, maybe three lights, for them to get all the way across.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s not just pedestrians who loathe Roosevelt Boulevard. “People who walk, drive, or take public transit are all pretty badly screwed,” Philadelphia’s public radio station <a href="https://billypenn.com/2017/02/06/how-roosevelt-boulevard-became-the-most-dangerous-road-in-philadelphia/">declared</a> in 2017.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Aware of the road’s shortcomings, city officials have long sought design changes that would reduce crashes. But they are powerless to act on their own, because the boulevard is controlled by the state of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That situation is common across the United States, where many of the most deadly, polluting, and generally awful urban streets are overseen by state departments of transportation (DOTs). Often they were constructed decades ago, when the surrounding areas were sparsely populated.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2022/hm10.cfm">only 14 percent of urban road miles nationwide</a> are under state control, two-thirds of all crash deaths in the 101 largest metro areas occur there, according to a recent <a href="https://smartgrowthamerica.org/dangerous-by-design/">Transportation for America report</a>. In some places, this disparity is widening: From 2016 to 2022, <a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/sites/default/files/files/ATD%20PIO/Vision%20Zero/Vision%20Zero%20Update%2005.25.23.pdf">road fatalities in Austin, Texas,</a> fell 20 percent on locally managed roads while soaring 98 percent on those the state oversees.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The country is littered with roads that are a legacy of the past, that don’t work very well, and that drive people crazy,” said US Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), who calls them “legacy highways.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of fixing such roadways, state officials tend to keep them as they are, citing limited resources or a need to maintain traffic speeds. In doing so, they constrain the capacity of even the most comprehensive local reforms to respond to urgent problems like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/25/23844717/america-safe-air-travel-car-safety-accidents">car crash deaths</a>, which are far more widespread in the US than among peer countries, or unreliable bus service.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unless state DOTs recognize that a successful urban road must do more than facilitate fast car trips, that problem will persist.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why we have state highways</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the early 1900s, states from coast to coast created transportation agencies to build smooth, wide roads that enabled long-distance car trips. New high-capacity roadways traversed forests and farmland, often terminating at what was then the urban edge. When Americans went on a car-buying binge after World War II, states like <a href="https://www.michiganhighways.org/history5.html">Michigan widened their highways</a> with the goal of keeping traffic moving quickly, a prime directive for engineers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://highways.dot.gov/public-roads/septoct-2000/genie-bottle-interstate-system-and-urban-problems-1939-1957">High-speed roadways</a> fed rapid suburbanization, with new developments mushrooming on the city periphery. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Columbus-Ohio">Columbus, Ohio</a>, for instance, roughly doubled in population from 1950 and 2000, while its land area quintupled. Sprawling cities in the South and Southwest <a href="https://population.us/az/mesa/">emerged seemingly overnight</a>, while <a href="https://www.leventhalmap.org/digital-exhibitions/bending-lines/why-persuade/1.1.2/">new suburbs encircled</a> older metropolises in the North.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In these newly urbanized areas, state highways that had previously meandered through the countryside were now lined with retail and housing. Their designers had initially paid little attention to transit, sidewalks, or tree cover — features that are often afterthoughts for rural roads, but crucial in more densely populated areas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As with Philadelphia’s Roosevelt Boulevard, the width and traffic speed of state roads in urban neighborhoods now frequently clash with local desires for street safety, quality transit service, and pedestrian comfort. But revising them is rarely a priority for state DOTs engaged in a Sisyphean battle against traffic congestion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If a state agency’s primary focus is on moving vehicles, they’re looking at reducing delays and building clear zones” that remove objects such as trees next to a road, where errant drivers might strike them, said Kristina Swallow, who previously led the Nevada DOT as well as urban planning for Tucson, Arizona. “At the local level, you’re looking at a bunch of other activities. You have people walking or on a bike, so you may be okay with some congestion, because you know that’s what happens when people are coming into an economically vibrant community.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">City-state tensions over state highways can take many forms. Roadway safety is often a flashpoint, since fixes frequently involve slowing traffic that state officials want to keep flowing. In San Antonio, for instance, the city negotiated for years with the Texas DOT to add sidewalks and bike lanes to Broadway, a state arterial with seven lanes. Last year the state <a href="https://sanantonioreport.org/san-antonio-txdot-broadway-corridor-funding/">scuttled that plan at the 11th hour, leaving Broadway’s current design in place.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Local efforts to improve transit service can also face state resistance. In September, Madison, Wisconsin, launched its first <a href="https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/routes-schedules/bus-rapid-transit">bus rapid transit</a> (BRT) line, a fast form of bus service that relies on dedicated bus lanes. But much of its route runs along East Washington, an arterial managed by Wisconsin, and the state transportation department prevented Madison from making the entire BRT lane bus-only <a href="https://media.cityofmadison.com/Mediasite/Showcase/madison-city-channel/Presentation/fe4f5aeeb21d4b38bb2fe030f894018b1d?playfrom=1452000">during rush hour</a>. That could sabotage the new service out of the gate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These dedicated bus lanes would serve the bus best in the heaviest traffic, so it’s counterintuitive to typical BRT design,” said Chris McCahill, who leads the State Smart Transportation Initiative at the University of Wisconsin and serves on Madison’s transportation commission. Wisconsin’s DOT did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The whole point of fast transit programs like BRT is to get more people to ride transit instead of driving, thereby increasing the total <em>human</em> capacity of a road since buses are much more space-efficient than cars. But that logic can escape state transportation executives oriented toward longer, intercity trips instead of shorter, intracity ones, as well as highway engineers trained to focus on maximizing the speed of all vehicles, regardless of how many people are inside them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even sympathetic state transportation officials may not fix dysfunctional urban roadways due to limited resources and competing needs that include expensive upgrades to bridges and interstates. Critical but relatively small-dollar projects, such as street intersection adjustments that better serve pedestrians or bus riders, can get lost in the shuffle. Lacking the authority to make changes themselves, city officials are stuck.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“How do you create connected networks when you don’t own the intersection, and to fix it you have to compete at the state level with 500 other projects?” said <a href="https://nacto.org/person/stefanie-seskin/">Stefanie Seskin</a>, the director of policy and practice at the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As an example, Seskin cited the state-controlled St. Mary’s Street bridge in Brookline, a dense suburb adjacent to Boston. “It’s the only way to get to and from Boston that isn’t on a major, super busy arterial,” she said. “It’s not structurally deficient, but from the position of those walking, biking, and using transit, it’s just not functioning well. It requires a reconstruction” — something that Massachusetts has not done.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The beginnings of a paradigm shift in transportation policy</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With deaths among US pedestrians and cyclists <a href="https://www.vox.com/23784549/pedestrian-deaths-traffic-safety-fatalities-governors-association">hitting a 40-year high in 2022</a>, a growing number of state DOTs are starting to acknowledge that maximizing vehicle speed is not the only goal that matters on urban roadways. The Pennsylvania DOT, for example, is now <a href="https://www.penndot.pa.gov/RegionalOffices/district-6/ConstructionsProjectsAndRoadwork/Philadelphia/Pages/Roosevelt-Boulevard-Improvement-Projects.aspx">working</a> with Philadelphia to at last bring lane redesigns, bus lane improvements, and speed cameras to Roosevelt Boulevard. On the other side of the country, the head of the Washington state DOT has <a href="https://www.theurbanist.org/2024/08/23/wsdot-head-wants-150-million-annual-stroad-fund/">requested $150 million</a> from the state legislature to address the shortcomings of legacy highways.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think there are people in every single state DOT who want to be more proactive and to plan for safer streets for people who are moving, no matter what mode of transportation they use,” Seskin told me. “I don&#8217;t think that that was necessarily the case 20 years ago.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, fixing the deficiencies of state roadways requires a paradigm shift within state DOTs, with senior officials accepting that maximizing car speeds jeopardizes crucial local priorities like accommodating pedestrians, enabling rapid transit service, or supporting outdoor dining.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such nuance can escape state highway engineers trained with a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-06-03/in-killed-by-a-traffic-engineer-a-us-road-planner-pleads-for-reform?sref=qYiz2hd0">myopic focus on vehicle speed</a>. “Many of the people doing roadway design work for states are still stuck in the old model,” said Billy Hattaway, an engineer who previously held senior transportation roles in the Florida DOT as well as the city of Orlando.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">McCahill, of the State Smart Transportation Initiative, empathized with those toiling within state DOTs. “Think about their position as engineers,” he said. “They&#8217;ve got their federal highway design guidelines, they&#8217;ve got their state guidelines. They&#8217;ve been conditioned to be conservative and not try new things.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, those roadway design guidelines have prioritized free-flowing traffic. Making them more malleable could empower engineers to get more creative. Instead of applying one-size-fits-all rules for elements like lane widths and traffic lights, “<a href="https://trid.trb.org/View/1085159">context-sensitive design</a>” encourages engineers working in urban settings to add pedestrian crossings, narrow lanes, and other features that can support local transportation needs. McCahill applauded Florida’s DOT for recently “rewriting” <a href="https://www.fdot.gov/roadway/fdm/default.shtm">its design guide</a> to incorporate such context-sensitive layouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal money could help finance such redesigns — if state officials know how to use it. “There’s a lack of knowledge about the flexibility of federal dollars, with misunderstandings and different interpretations,” said NACTO’s Seskin. Recognizing the issue, over the summer, the <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/specialfunding/legacyhighways/240726.pdf">Federal Highway Administration published guidance</a> and held a webinar highlighting dozens of federal funding programs available to upgrade legacy highways.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there is an alternative approach: Rather than revise problematic roads themselves, states can hand them over to local officials, letting them manage improvements and maintenance. Washington state, for instance, in 2011 <a href="https://housedemocrats.wa.gov/blog/2011/02/26/bothell-to-get-2-5-miles-of-sr-527-for-multiway-boulevard-project/">transferred</a> a 2.5-mile strip of state road 522 to the Seattle suburb of Bothell. But such moves are not always financially feasible.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The risk is that when you transfer a highway to local government, you take away the capacity to properly fund it over the long term” because the city becomes responsible for upkeep, said <a href="https://www.nlc.org/people/brittney-d-kohler/">Brittney Kohler</a>, the legislative director of transportation and infrastructure for the National League of Cities. Unless the revamped road spurs development that creates new tax revenue, as it did in Bothell, cash-strapped cities may be unable to afford the costs of retrofits and ongoing maintenance.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">States and cities can work together to fix legacy highways — and federal support can help</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Portland, Oregon, pretty much everyone <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2012/03/portlands_bad_roads_readers_re.html">seems to agree </a>that 82nd Avenue, a major thoroughfare that the state manages, is a disaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Originally a little-used roadway marking the eastern edge of the city, 82nd Avenue has developed into a bustling arterial. It’s been a dangerous eyesore for decades, with potholed pavement, insufficient pedestrian crossings, inadequate lighting, and minimal tree cover, said Art Pearce, a deputy director for the Portland Bureau of Transportation. According to city statistics, from 2012 to 2021, crashes on the thoroughfare caused 14 deaths and 122 serious injuries. At least two-thirds of crash victims were pedestrians, bicyclists, or occupants of cars turning left at intersections without traffic signals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During winter storms, Pearce said state workers would often clear nearby Interstate 205 but leave 82nd Avenue unplowed, leaving the city to do it without compensation. “Our priority in snow and ice is to keep public transit moving, and 82nd Avenue has the highest transit ridership in the whole state,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearby residents and business owners have been begging local officials to revamp 82nd Avenue for decades, said Pearce and Blumenauer (whose congressional district includes Portland). The state was willing to transfer the roadway to the city, but the local officials wanted more than a handshake.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We were like, if you give us $500 million, the city will take over 82nd Avenue and fix it,” Pearce said. “The state officials answered, ‘We don’t have $500 million, so hey, good meeting.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A breakthrough came in 2021, when the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/american-rescue-plan/">American Rescue Plan Act</a> offered states and cities a one-time influx of federal funding. Matching that money with contributions of their own, the state and city negotiated a <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2021/11/18/oregon-odot-portland-82nd-avenue-local-control/">transfer of seven miles of 82nd Avenue from the Oregon DOT to Portland</a>. Some $185 million will go toward new features including sidewalk extensions, trees, a BRT line, and curb cuts for those using a wheelchair or stroller. Blumenauer, who said that reconstructing 82nd Avenue has been a personal goal for 35 years, led US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg on <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/2023/07/us-transportation-secretary-pete-buttigieg-tours-portlands-82nd-avenue-sees-opportunities-for-area.html">a tour</a> of the roadway last year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The success story is “a bit of a one-off,” Blumenauer admits, reliant on stimulus dollars tied to the Covid-19 pandemic. But a dedicated federal funding source could enable similar roadway reboots nationwide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, President-elect Donald Trump and incoming congressional Republicans show little appetite for transportation reforms, but a golden opportunity will come during the development of the next <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/olsp/reportspubs.cfm">multiyear surface transportation bill</a>, which is expected to be passed after the 2026 midterms. Although Blumenauer did not run for reelection this month, he said he hopes the future bill will include a competitive grant program that invites state and local officials to submit joint proposals to upgrade state highways in urban areas, with federal dollars acting as a sweetener.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Otherwise, these state roads will continue to obstruct urban residents’ most cherished goals of safety, clean air, and public space. Flourishing cities cannot coexist with fast, decrepit roads. Too many state officials have not yet learned that lesson.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, a number of social media users were, once again, disappointed by the selection of a certain man to a coveted position. Actor John Krasinski — yes, Jim from <em>The Office</em> — was given the title of <a href="https://people.com/sexiest-man-alive-2024-john-krasinski-reveal-8743226">People’s<em> </em>“Sexiest Man Alive.”</a>&nbsp;</p>

In his most recent television role — on the Prime Video show<em> Jack Ryan</em>, which <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/jack-ryan-premiere-date-release-pattern-season-4-final-season-episode-count-prime-video-1235360151/">ended in 2023</a> — he played a buff, butt-kicking CIA agent. It’s more that his career has rarely ever required him to display any sort of sex appeal. His most crush-worthy role to date was arguably more than a decade ago on <em>The Office </em>as the funny and approachable Jim Halpert. Since then, the most female attention he gets on social media is when he’s posing with his wife, actress Emily Blunt, on a red carpet. Plus, it’s not exactly his year for visible hotness: His work in 2024 was almost entirely behind the scenes, directing the children’s film <em>IF</em> and producing <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this to say, in a pop culture landscape practically infested with “internet boyfriends,” Krasinski was a baffling choice. Amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/nov/12/celebrity-lookalike-contest-chalamet-mescal">look-alike competitions</a> being held for Hollywood’s hottest young men across the United States and Europe — your Timmy Chalamets, your Paul Mescals — the lack of excitement around this issue has never felt so loud. What does it even mean to be People’s sexiest man alive in 2024, if it means anything at all? And why are we still so invested? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For readers who witnessed <a href="https://people.com/patrick-dempsey-people-sexiest-man-alive-2023-exclusive-8391684">Patrick Dempsey receive this honor just last year</a>, it must be pointed out that the “Sexiest Man Alive” issue didn’t always feel this arbitrary and untimely. From its (<a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/mel-gibson-controversies-career-1234696080/">now-cursed</a>) inaugural issue in 1985 with box-office star Mel Gibson up until <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/channing-tatum-is-sexiest-man-alive-2012-2/">Channing Tatum’s spread in 2012</a>, the titular “man” felt representative of the tastes of the average (straight white) woman. Plus, it was often a star who was dominating at the box office. In the past, the cover served as the ultimate advertising vehicle for “it” guys who were either newly cementing themselves as full-fledged movie stars, like Brad Pitt in 1995 and George Clooney in 1997, or major celebs reassuring the public that they were still hot commodities, like Harrison Ford in 1998. While these selections have been <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/49968-why-is-peoples-sexiest-man-alive-always-a-white-guy-theres-a-diversity-problem-in-our">overwhelmingly white</a>, at least they once felt relevant.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People is a stalwart in an industry <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2023/where-to-buy-find-magazines-2023/">weathering difficult times</a>, and this special issue is arguably one of the things keeping the<em> </em>magazine on newsstands. According to <a href="https://digiday.com/media/peoples-sexiest-man-alive-numbers/">Digiday</a>, the sexiest man issue has “a rate base, or guaranteed circulation, of 3.7 million, compared to a regular issue of the magazine, with a rate base of 3.5 million.” Strategically published during the fourth quarter when consumers are doing Thanksgiving and Black Friday shopping, it’s proven to be a huge cash cow for People’s parent company, Dotdash Meredith.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-459591736.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel revealing “Thor” star Chris Hemsworth’s People’s “Sexiest Man Alive” cover on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in 2014." title="Late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel revealing “Thor” star Chris Hemsworth’s People’s “Sexiest Man Alive” cover on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in 2014." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Talk show host Jimmy Kimmel revealing actor Chris Hemsworth’s People’s “Sexiest Man Alive” cover on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” in 2014. | Adam Rose/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Adam Rose/Walt Disney Television via Getty Images " />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the 2010s, though, the issue started to receive some blowback — or, more accurately, the advent of social media allowed these complaints to be expressed in a hypervisible way. It wasn’t just that only two men of color, Denzel Washington and Keanu Reeves, had received the award until 2016, when Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson graced the cover. The choosing of celebrities like Adam Levine, a rockstar with a reputation for being a <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/adam-levine">so-called douchebag</a> raised eyebrows in 2013 and also performed <a href="https://digiday.com/media/peoples-sexiest-man-alive-numbers/">relatively poorly</a> on newsstands. His co-star on <em>The Voice</em>, Blake Shelton, has maybe done the most damage to the issue’s reputation. The unveiling of his cover in 2017 sent <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/15/16657338/blake-shelton-sexiest-man-backlash">the internet into hysterics</a> for days. John Legend (another judge on <em>The Voice</em>) in 2019 felt almost equally random. Even <a href="https://people.com/sexiest-man-alive-2024-benny-blanco-gentleman-rules-exclusive-8739608">Benny Blanco’s appearance</a> in the current issue as an honorable mention was <a href="https://x.com/orseunid/status/1856028280534516169">strongly</a> <a href="https://x.com/FireHeart5_15/status/1856028734999904382">objected</a> to online. Year over year, the “Sexiest Man Alive” has become less of a trusted assertion and more of a platform for debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The details of the selection process for this issue have largely been kept under wraps. In a 2012 interview with <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/videos/life/2012/11/16/1708277/">USA Today</a>, former editor Julie Jordan said People temperature-checks in a few ways, including asking female celebrities, consulting focus groups, and observing social media. There are constant rumors, including in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1gq5cw1/john_krasinski_has_been_named_people_magazines/">Krasinski’s case</a>, that the title can be bought or won by a convincing publicist. It’s easy to forget, though, that the selected men also have to be willing to participate in this extremely public form of objectification. The less impeachable <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/ryan-gosling-turned-down-peoples-sexiest-man-alive-multiple-times-insider-says-exclusive/">Ryan Gosling</a> reportedly turned down the offer twice.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even with an increasingly questionable reputation, social media has remained invested in this frivolous honor, particularly this year. Maybe it’s because People did a good job of <a href="https://x.com/FilmUpdates/status/1856025544917504199">incessantly</a> <a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/1856402295514145217">teasing</a> the reveal on social media with the help of&nbsp;dominant X accounts like FilmUpdates and PopCrave. Maybe it’s because the public needed a distraction from a much more crucial and devastating election. In the midst of political tumult, Krasinski is ultimately a “safe,” fairly inoffensive option, a celebrity that millennials obsessed with <em>The Office</em> have a level of affinity for. Despite questions about his <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2020/02/john-krasinski-politics-conservative-quiet-place?srsltid=AfmBOopO_8-8rEPKXzptJjI5yO6AsPk89WjgD9LdLWimNY0yVF3E2aq0">political affiliation</a>, he hasn&#8217;t been mired in any real controversy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever relevance the title holds, the sport of debating and crowning famous men as “sexy” and “hot” has never really gotten old. Like awards shows, it’s one of the last examples of celebrity monoculture for consumers to collectively engage with. In an <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24114819/industry-plants-music-pop-rap-internet-hottest-conspiracy">overly skeptical social media landscape</a>, it also seems as though half of the fun of the issue is negotiating whether the awarded person is a genuine attempt to reflect consumers’ taste or some elaborate PR play being fed to us.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However meaningless the issue has become these days, it’s been successful in producing two things: revenue and a good, hollow debate.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that two of his most vocal supporters, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1856658569124262092/photo/1">will lead</a> the “Department of Government Efficiency.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Together, these two wonderful Americans will pave the way for my Administration to dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,” <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1856658569124262092/photo/1">Trump said</a>. “It will become, potentially, ‘The Manhattan Project’ of our time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re wondering why you’ve never heard of this department before, it’s because it doesn’t exist. Despite the misleading name — executive departments <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/13/department-of-government-efficiency-musk-ramaswamy/">can only be established by Congress</a> — Trump simply appears to be forming a new <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74lgwkrmrpo">presidential advisory commission</a> or task force to offer guidance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So at first glance, this commission might seem entirely unserious. Its acronym, “DOGE,” is an apparent homage to the meme cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-surges-amid-donald-trump-elon-musk-joining-doge-crypto-news-19508910.htm">that Musk often promotes</a>, and the coin’s value <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=dogecoin+surge&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">surged after Trump</a> made the announcement. It’s also somewhat ironic that a commission looking for government inefficiency and waste requires not one but two co-chairs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the project isn’t only an inside joke, it’s also part of Trump’s existing plan to decimate the federal workforce. His campaign called for <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/11/07/trump-dc-federal-workforce-cuts/">relocating government workers</a> out of Washington, DC, and making significant cuts to civil service jobs — an attempt to dismantle what Trump and his allies call the “deep state,” even though these jobs are often necessary to keep the federal programs running — and “DOGE” shows that he’s at least starting to execute that plan.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump didn’t acknowledge that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency is new, nor did he really explain what it will look like. He only <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1856658569124262092/photo/1">offered vague details</a>, like how the commission would “provide advice and guidance from outside of Government, and will partner with the White House and Office of Management &amp; Budget to drive large scale structural reform.” The commission, in other words, is unlikely to have any regulatory teeth on its own, but there’s little doubt that it can have influence on the incoming administration and how it will determine its budgets.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What Musk and Ramaswamy want, and why it’s dangerous</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it’s still unclear what this commission will look like or how big it will be, there’s plenty of reason to take the threat that it poses seriously. On the campaign trail, Musk, who served as a Trump surrogate, promised to find <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/13/department-of-government-efficiency-musk-ramaswamy/">$2 trillion</a> that could be eliminated from the federal government’s $6.75 trillion budget. And Ramaswamy, who ran against Trump in the Republican primaries but later campaigned for him, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-trump.html">has proposed</a> laying off 75 percent of the federal workforce and abolishing agencies like the FBI, IRS, and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/education/384779/department-of-education-trump-musk-betsy-devos">Department of Education</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The scale of those cuts would be catastrophic. In October, Musk himself <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381637/elon-musk-donald-trump-2024-election-temporary-hardship">said his plan</a> to slash the federal budget would cause economic turmoil, cause markets to crash, and “necessarily involve some temporary hardship.” Experts have also said Musk’s $2 trillion figure is more than merely aspirational — it’s practically impossible to find that much money to cut without putting <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/12/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-department-of-government-efficiency-trump/index.html">social programs on the chopping board</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You can&#8217;t get to cuts of the size they&#8217;ve been throwing around without gutting things people really care about and count on,” Sharon Parrott, president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said by email.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As my colleague <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381637/elon-musk-donald-trump-2024-election-temporary-hardship">Eric Levitz wrote</a>, if Trump doesn’t cut Social Security, Medicare, or defense spending, he would need to cut other government programs by up to 80 percent: </p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">That would involve gutting all social services for low-income Americans, food inspections, air safety, health insurance subsidies, and infrastructure investments, among countless other things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The commission, which Trump said will conclude its work within two years, is also riddled with conflicts of interest. Musk’s company SpaceX, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/12/us/politics/elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-trump.html">has more than $10 billion</a> in government contracts, and agencies like NASA are <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2024/08/boeing-spacex-stranded-iss-astroanuts/679613/">already overly dependent on it</a>. The federal government has also <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-legal-list-tesla-x-spacex-court-cases-investigations">been investigating</a> and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/tech/sec-sanctions-elon-musk-testimony-twitter-probe/index.html">filing lawsuits</a> against Musk’s companies, and Musk himself has often <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91196851/spacex-musk-faa-chief-safety-standards">complained about</a> his companies facing too much government oversight. Now, Musk will be advising the next president on which agencies he should try to eliminate.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The “Department of Government Efficiency” isn’t necessarily a new idea</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politicians always promise to end government waste, and a frequent target is the civil service. Under the Clinton administration, for example, Vice President Al Gore led the <a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2013/04/what-reinvention-wrought/62836/">National Partnership for Reinventing Government</a>, an initiative aimed at streamlining the federal bureaucracy by eliminating unnecessary jobs and rolling back wasteful spending. While the project succeeded in some respects, it also created bad outcomes. The reduction in the federal workforce <a href="https://www.govexec.com/management/2013/04/what-reinvention-wrought/62836/">wasn’t especially well targeted</a>, and as a result, people with necessary and special skills left, which made it harder for the government to actually work better, as promised.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Ronald Reagan — who in his inaugural address <a href="https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/inaugural-address-1981#:~:text=They%20will%20go%20away%20because,problem%3B%20government%20is%20the%20problem.">said</a>, “Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem,” — also promised a massive scaling back of the federal government’s reach. He had plans to abolish major government agencies, like the Education and Energy Departments, and <a href="https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/archives/speech/remarks-signing-federal-employee-hiring-freeze-memorandum-and-cabinet-member">imposed a hiring freeze</a> on the first day of his administration. But Reagan’s plan to reduce the federal government’s footprint failed, and by the time he left office, <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/why-reagans-vaunted-starve-the-beast-plan-failed/">there were more people employed</a> by the federal government than when he started. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s plan to dramatically reduce government spending and downsize the federal workforce will likely run into similar hurdles. Part of the reason Musk and Ramaswamy might have a hard time finding legitimately wasteful spending is because the federal workforce hasn’t grown all that much. The federal government employs about 3 million full-time workers — <a href="https://data.bls.gov/dataViewer/view/timeseries/CEU9091000001">roughly the same as</a> in the late 1960s. And while that number is much higher (about 10 million) when you take contractors into account, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-true-size-of-government-is-nearing-a-record-high/">that also hasn’t changed much</a> since the 1980s, mostly ebbing and flowing but not exponentially increasing. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The newly created commission is especially unlikely to succeed in finding significant sources of waste — at least nowhere near $2 trillion — because it’s probably not going to go after areas of spending that actually need better accounting, like the Pentagon, which has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-fails-audit-sixth-year-row-2023-11-16/">failed its audit</a> six years in a row. But that doesn’t mean the commission won’t recommend any cuts, and the scale that Musk and Ramaswamy are hoping for will almost certainly have a negative impact on the economy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So while the announcement of the commission might have excited some Republicans and <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/cryptocurrency/dogecoin-surges-amid-donald-trump-elon-musk-joining-doge-crypto-news-19508910.htm">meme-coin investors</a>, they should know that if this commission succeeds, there <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/381637/elon-musk-donald-trump-2024-election-temporary-hardship">might be a recession</a> on the other side.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">Donald Trump</a> is headed to the White House, again, so it’s not surprising that Americans are again contending with a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hate-on-the-rise-after-trumps-election">rise in hate speech</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This time around, one of the attack lines is “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/business/your-body-my-choice-movement-election/index.html">your body, my choice</a>.” Attributed by some to an election night post on X by <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23484314/trump-fuentes-ye-dinner-white-nationalism-supremacy">white supremacist Nick Fuentes</a> that read “Your body, my choice. Forever,” the phrase transforms the longstanding feminist and abortion rights slogan “My body, my choice” into an attack on women’s autonomy, and, at worst, a threat of rape.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the days following the election, TikTok creators have reported seeing the phrase crop up in comments on their videos, according to <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/your-body-my-choice-hate-and-harassment-towards-women-spreads-online/">a report</a> by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a global nonpartisan think tank that studies disinformation and extremism. One creator <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/your-body-my-choice-hate-and-harassment-towards-women-spreads-online/">said</a> she had to delete a video because commenters were “saying they couldn’t wait until I get raped or ‘your body my choice.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Girls and young women are also hearing the line in schools, according to family members, with one mom <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/your-body-my-choice-hate-and-harassment-towards-women-spreads-online/">posting on Facebook</a> that her daughter had heard it three times on campus, and that boys told her to “sleep with one eye open tonight.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instances of the phrase increased 4,600 percent on X between last Thursday and Friday, <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/your-body-my-choice-hate-and-harassment-towards-women-spreads-online/">according to the report</a>. Meanwhile, Fuentes’s original post has been <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/business/your-body-my-choice-movement-election/index.html">reposted more than 35,000 times</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The spike in sexist hate is a reflection of one of the dominant narratives of the election: that it was essentially <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/383154/trump-victory-men-podcasters">a triumph of men over women</a>. Trump tailored much of his campaign to disaffected American men — especially young men, many of whom feel they are <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/383364/gen-z-podcasts-trump-win-joe-rogan-bros">victims of discrimination</a> and who have expressed resentment against <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23581859/me-too-backlash-susan-faludi-weinstein-roe-dobbs-depp-heard">feminist movements like Me Too</a>. For a lot of these men, the election feels like vindication, and for some, it’s more than that: a chance to put women back in their place.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For anyone on the receiving end of the misogynist insults in the last few days, meanwhile, the phrase feels like a scary harbinger of things to come. At the same time, experts told Vox that Americans have experienced this kind of hate speech before, particularly in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/10/21/massive-rise-in-hate-speech-twitter-during-presidential-election-donald-trump/92486210/">Trump’s first election in 2016</a> — and that history can hold lessons for navigating the present.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The phrase is part of a larger pattern of misogyny</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The feminist phrase “my body, my choice” was used regularly in chants at rallies by 1970, though it’s not clear who originally coined it, said Laura Prieto, program director of <a href="https://ourbodiesourselves.org/">Our Bodies Ourselves Today</a>, a digital platform that is an iteration of the iconic reproductive health book <em>Our Bodies, Ourselves</em>. In the years before <em>Roe v. Wade</em>, it was a call for abortion rights, but it was also “a statement about women demanding their right as equal human beings to have decision-making power over what happened to them,” Prieto said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The term has become <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/annanorth/planned-parenthood-moving-away-from-choice">less popular on the left</a> in recent years, especially after it was <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/07/04/1109367458/my-body-my-choice-vaccines">adopted by anti-vaccine activists</a>. Now “my body, my choice” has been co-opted by Fuentes and others, who have transformed it into a tool to harass and intimidate women.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others aren’t using the phrase, but are <a href="https://x.com/MillerStream/status/1854247807735214298">echoing the idea</a> that with Trump’s election, women must submit to the will of men. On social media, posts have ranged from “more coded misogyny” to “very direct threats of rape,” Isabelle Frances-Wright, director of technology and society at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue and one of the authors of the report, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of the sexist posts stem from <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2023/1/10/23547393/andrew-tate-toxic-masculinity-qa">“manosphere” influencers like Andrew Tate</a> and their followers, according to the report — Tate, for example, posted on X on November 7, “I saw a woman crossing the road today but I just kept my foot down. Right of way? You no longer have rights.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Manosphere” creators are part of a larger online ecosystem directed at men that’s lurched hard to the right in recent years, and helped carry Trump to victory, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/383364/gen-z-podcasts-trump-win-joe-rogan-bros">Vox’s Rebecca Jennings reported</a>. Fifty-five percent of male voters cast their ballots for Trump this year, compared with just 45 percent of female voters, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/exit-polls-2024-election/">exit polling by the Washington Post</a>.<strong> </strong>(Though we ought to note that exit polling is preliminary, and therefore unreliable, data.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Online, that gender divide emerged before the election. The Institute for Strategic Dialogue reports spotting <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/your-body-my-choice-hate-and-harassment-towards-women-spreads-online/">a rise in misogynistic posts</a> (including calls to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/former-trump-aide-jokes-stripping-womens-right-vote-male-only-1977295">repeal the 19th Amendment</a>) starting in October, apparently in response to the Harris campaign’s focus on women voters and reproductive rights. The spread of the posts “demonstrated the influence of an increasingly vindictive set of online actors, who appear to be using the election results as a permission structure to more overtly and aggressively espouse narratives about curbing women’s rights,” Frances-Wright and co-author Moustafa Ayad write in their report.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A similar pattern emerged after Trump’s first election in 2016, when civil rights groups and law enforcement agencies saw <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/hate-on-the-rise-after-trumps-election">a spike in hate speech</a> and attacks on women and people perceived to be Muslim or immigrants — all groups Trump explicitly or implicitly denigrated in his first campaign. The harassment even made its way into classrooms; <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertsamaha/kids-are-quoting-trump-to-bully-their-classmates">a BuzzFeed analysis</a> found more than 50 incidents of a student invoking Trump’s name or message to attack a classmate during the 2016–‘17 school year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The fact that the attacks aren’t new doesn’t make them less scary for the people on the receiving end. “It is very traumatic, particularly the younger that you are,” Frances-Wright said. Implicit threats of rape can feel doubly frightening in a country where Trump just cruised to victory despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/381187/trump-access-hollywood-video-gen-z-tiktok">multiple allegations of sexual assault</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to counter post-election hate</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the harassment people are experiencing today is part of a longstanding pattern, however, there’s an existing playbook to counteract it. Some organizations, including <a href="https://edsource.org/2024/california-education-leaders-try-to-reassure-students-of-protections-against-trump-policies/721853">schools</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DCCODBtSm24/?igsh=MTc4MmM1YmI2Ng==">bookstores</a>, have issued statements in recent days clarifying that they will not tolerate discrimination or harassment.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to report harassment</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">If you or someone you know is experiencing harassment right now, help is available:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Sexual Violence Resource Center has <a href="https://www.nsvrc.org/blogs/online-harassment-resources" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nsvrc.org/blogs/online-harassment-resources">a list of resources</a> for dealing with online harassment.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Our Bodies, Ourselves Today maintains a list of <a href="https://ourbodiesourselves.org/health-info/gender-based-violence-get-involved">groups fighting gender-based violence</a>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://avp.org/get-involved/">The Anti-Violence Project</a> works against hate directed at LGBTQ and HIV-affected communities.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also a time to remember the long history of “my body, my choice,” and everything it stood for — including <a href="https://x.com/rokwon/status/1854305397835956424">hardships for women</a> that must have seemed, at times, impossible to overcome, including a lack of many basic rights like the ability to open credit cards in their names or serve on juries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“A lot of things that we take for granted, just because they seem to be really powerful right now, it doesn&#8217;t mean that they always will be,” Prieto said. “The one thing you can count on is that things are going to change.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While campaigning, President-elect Donald Trump <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Zxfnqj_3XQ">repeatedly threatened</a> to <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/07/republicans-trump-project-2025-abolish-department-of-education/">dismantle the US Department of Education</a> (DOE), on the basis that the federal education apparatus is “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tscgWCBbeao">indoctrinating young people with inappropriate racial, sexual, and political material</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“One thing I’ll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the Department of Education in Washington, DC, and sending all education and education work it needs back to the states,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tscgWCBbeao">Trump said in a 2023 video outlining his education policy goals</a>. “We want them to run the education of our children because they’ll do a much better job of it. You can’t do worse.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Closing the department wouldn’t be easy for Trump, but it isn’t impossible — and even if the DOE remains open, there are certainly ways Trump could radically change education in the United States. Here’s what’s possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can Trump actually close the DOE?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Technically, yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, “It would take an act of Congress to take it out,” Don Kettl, professor emeritus and former dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland, told Vox. “It would take an act of Congress to radically restructure it. And so the question is whether or not there&#8217;d be appetite on the Hill for abolishing the department.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not such an easy prospect, even though the Republicans look set to take narrow control of the Senate and the House. That’s because abolishing the department “would require 60 votes unless the Republicans abolish the filibuster,” Jal Mehta, professor of education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without the <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/2019/6/17/18681798/filibuster-senate-broke-video">filibuster rule</a>, legislation would need a simple majority to pass, but senators have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/1/19/22881837/senate-filibuster-vote-voting-rights-joe-manchin-kyrsten-sinema">hesitant to get rid of it</a> in recent years. With the filibuster in place, Republicans would need some Democratic senators to join their efforts to kill the department. The likelihood of Democratic senators supporting such a move is almost nonexistent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means the push to unwind the department is probably largely symbolic. And that is the best-case scenario, Jon Valant, director of the Brookings Institution’s Brown Center on Education Policy, told Vox. According to Valant, dismantling it would simultaneously damage the US education system while also failing to accomplish Trump’s stated goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Closing the department “would wreak havoc across the country,” Valant said. “It would cause terrible pain. It would cause terrible pain in parts of the country represented by congressional Republicans too.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of that pain would likely fall on the country’s most vulnerable students:&nbsp;poor students, students in rural areas, and students with disabilities. That’s because the department’s civil rights powers help it to support state education systems in providing specialized resources to those students.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Furthermore, much of what Trump and MAGA activists claim the agency is responsible for — like teaching critical race theory and LGBTQ “ideology” — isn’t actually the purview of the DOE; things like curriculum and teacher choice are already the domain of state departments of education. And only about 10 percent of federal public education funding flows to state boards of education, according to Valant. The rest comes primarily from tax sources, so states and local school districts are already controlling much of the funding structure of their specific public education systems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I find it a little bewildering that the US Department of Education has become such a lightning rod here, in part because I don&#8217;t know how many people have any idea what the department actually does,” Valant said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even without literally shutting the doors to the federal agency, there could be ways a Trump administration could hollow the DOE and do significant damage, Valant and Kettl said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The administration could require the agency to cut the roles of agency employees, particularly those who <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/05/governance-experts-launch-group-oppose-schedule-f/396754/">ideologically disagree with the administration</a>. It could also appoint officials with limited (or no) education expertise, hampering the department’s day-to-day work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump officials could also attempt changes to the department’s higher education practices. The department is one of several state and nongovernmental institutions involved in college accreditation, for example — and <a href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/10/11/scalise-harvard-accreditation/">House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA) has threatened</a> to weaponize the accreditation process against universities he believes to be too “woke.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, Trump could use the department’s leadership role to affect policy indirectly: “There&#8217;s power that comes from just communicating to states what you would like to see” being taught in schools, Valant said. “And there are a lot of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/oklahoma-bible-schools-trump-amend-99bec8ed6b67acd2d836913783c4fe7b">state leaders</a> around the country who seem ready to follow that lead.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s plans for the department will become clearer once the administration nominates an education secretary. Once that person is confirmed, Kettl said, “They&#8217;re just gonna be off to the races on the issue again.”</p>

The former president made plenty of pledges on the campaign trail — now it&#8217;s time to see what&#8217;s actually possible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox explains the agenda for Trump&#8217;s second term. We take a look at what Trump&#8217;s victory means for <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/381773/trump-win-election-abortion-ban-filibuster-dobbs">reproductive freedom</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/383549/minimum-wage-ballot-measures-missouri-alaska">antipoverty programs</a>, how his calls for <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/383884/supreme-court-donald-trump-tariffs-inflation-economy">tariffs will transform the economy</a>, the realities of a plan for <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">mass deportations</a>, and more. We track Trump&#8217;s promises and policies — on everything from artificial intelligence to Middle East policy — and how Americans are reacting in the wake of his historic win.</p>

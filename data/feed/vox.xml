<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a truism that everything’s bigger in America — just look at the <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2024/03/11/why-american-cars-are-so-big">cars</a> and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/09/american-houses-big/597811/">houses</a>. But perhaps nowhere is the virtue of bigger is better more bizarrely apparent than how toilet paper is sold. Wander into the bathroom products aisle at the supermarket and you’ve entered a topsy-turvy world where numbers shape-shift. A pack of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charmin-Toilet-Family-Cushiony-Packaging/dp/B07986PWD3">18 mega</a> toilet paper rolls, for example, magically transforms into 90 “regular” ones. The labeling emphasizes this greater number in large font, lest you foolishly think 18 simply equals 18. Another pack might insist that 12 <a href="https://www.target.com/p/charmin-ultra-strong-toilet-paper-12-mega-xxl-rolls/-/A-91778080">even-thicker rolls</a> of toilet paper are the equivalent of 96 normal rolls.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The advertising is clear: You’re getting a lot of toilet paper. That should be good news, since if there’s one rule of thumb everyone should live by, it’s never run out of TP. We saw anxiety around this eventuality reach new heights in the early days of the pandemic, when crowds of people <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/amid-coronavirus-fears-shoppers-throw-punches-over-toilet-paper-1491220">fought to snap up as much toilet paper</a> as they could, leading to a <a href="https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2020/05/coronavirus-toilet-paper-shortage/">shortage</a> and extreme <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/coronavirus-price-gouging-hand-sanitizer-masks-wipes.html">price gouging</a>. Americans’ enormous vehicles and palatial abodes may in fact exist in service of conveying and storing gigantic bulk packs of this bathroom essential.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s some irony, then, that for all the trumpeting of gargantuan sizes, toilet paper rolls are generally getting smaller. It’s a key example of the trend of manufacturers charging the same price (or even slightly more) for less product that’s been dubbed “shrinkflation.” It makes it more difficult than ever to figure out if you’re getting ripped off. None of the three major toilet paper manufacturers Vox reached out to responded to a request for comment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I really can’t think of any other category that’s as confusing as toilet paper,” says Neil Saunders, managing director of retail at the consulting firm GlobalData. With dubious numerical claims about how much a “mega” roll is really worth, brands can promote the perception of value without actually having to show their work. Figuring out the price per toilet paper sheet is a hassle, but it would show how much more expensive the product has become.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The consumer wouldn’t like that, so they all keep it a bit opaque,” Saunders says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Get ready for some back-of-the-toilet-paper math</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most glaring issue plaguing the toilet paper industry is a lack of standardization. Double, triple, and mega rolls are imprecise descriptors that vary by brand; they are not measurement units. In fine print, toilet paper packaging will often admit that these sizes are relative to the “regular” roll — sometimes they mean their own brand’s regular size, but other times, it’s against a competitor’s one-ply regular.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unsurprisingly, the so-called standard size has no consistency, either. Charmin’s regular roll has <a href="https://shop.charmin.com/ultra-strong-regular-roll/">55 two-ply sheets</a>, for example, but it’s often hard to even find the regular size of a brand’s toilet paper in stores. The mega roll is often advertised as having <a href="https://www.quiltednorthern.com/faq">four times as many sheets</a> as the mythical “regular” it’s being compared to, which means that <a href="https://www.cottonelle.com/en-us/products/toilet-paper/ultra-comfort">Cottonelle’s</a> idea of a regular roll contains 61 sheets, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quilted-Northern-Strong-Packaging-Regular/dp/B0BT34BJ8S">Quilted Northern’s</a> an awkward 73.75 sheets, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Angel-Soft-Toilet-Seasonal-Evergreen/dp/B0B2252ZP6">Angel Soft’s</a> 80 sheets. But even these are perplexing figures since many real-life <a href="https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-bath-tissue-2-ply-380-sheets-30-rolls.product.100645583.html">standard</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Scott-Professional-13607-Individually-Convenience/dp/B0040ZOEXU?crid=31LW9AE7EEMRX&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.j_nC_bMnzRnBFISOAwUY2IJN1F8_HLQNXc5ttzNZkWnLkPzMcR19_vR1Ef0ZmAxMiFm3npa6POteKaNdDe_-wUSP9Spa8gTAeR6GrnTEHaX16VZshSYHSoMN1o5pVh0GCPRN-BRoGs9TMx4_sjO1KQQN52zetzWH8pxN2Jnrnnp-WsSk0Fg5k-u2oV_wlmzBjZDMGLYapXqvVUgXmgT0HBvX6ScQoLlG5vmufngeeNfR_2n4mh6wQxvrKmRZ-ckZVVYXgxyk2FYnmxQW5t93uZW90LRC7xKHf8sdb6361No.aKriB0qtzi-nJ3ETOyGnchXK3-mEevLNNm3VnZouJZI&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=standard%2Btoilet%2Bpaper%2Broll&amp;qid=1730310506&amp;sprefix=standard%2Btoilet%2Bpaper%2Broll%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1">toilet</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cottonelle-12456PK-Ultra-Tissue-Sheets/dp/B00UZNZV24">paper</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Generation-Toilet-Tissue-Recycled/dp/B00D3JA5V4">rolls</a> contain more than 100 sheets.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The sheets-per-roll ratio is also subject to change depending on whether you’re looking at single-ply, two-ply, or three-ply. (Not to make your brain hurt more, but <a href="https://www.supplytime.com/Blogs/Blog/The-Size-of-a-Sheet-of-Toilet-Paper-Matters_16.aspx">sheet dimensions</a> vary too.) The mega roll is just one size out of many that brands offer, all with slightly different naming conventions. Cottonelle sells mega, family mega, or super mega, while Charmin now offers the <a href="https://www.charmin.com/en-us/shop-products/ultra-strong-toilet-paper-mega-xxl-roll">mega-XXL</a> and even the “<a href="https://shop.charmin.com/all-products/">forever roll</a>,” which is so big you need a standalone holder. There appears to be no limit to the jumbofication of toilet paper jargon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this renders comparison shopping far more challenging than it is for the average household product. Making matters worse, there’s no single consistent method of unit pricing for toilet paper. Some retailers, like Walmart, Amazon, and Target, show the price per 100 sheets, but then you still have to factor in the variation in sheets per roll for each brand. Walgreens shows price per sheet, while Home Depot displays a pretty unhelpful price per roll. Irregular unit price labeling is a problem for many consumer products, according to Chuck Bell, programs director of advocacy at Consumer Reports. Unit pricing is “only mandated directly in nine states,” Bell says, while 10 others have voluntarily taken it up. “It’s hard to compare products online for value for money.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s no wonder people have taken matters into their own hands. In late 2018, a California man named Victor Ly launched a “<a href="https://tetrion.com/tpcalc.php?r">Toilet Paper Value Calculator</a>” that crunches the number of rolls, sheets per roll, and any discounts that apply. Ly told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/money/toilet-paper-deals/">Wirecutter</a> in 2022 that a good deal was probably around 0.253 cents per sheet. While there’s no longer a toilet paper shortage or people panic-buying pallets of them — though the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/02/business/toilet-paper-shortages-port-strike/index.html">impulse to do so lingers</a> — it’s a much <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2023/11/8/23951098/economy-inflation-prices-job-market-sticker-shock">more expensive</a> commodity today than before the pandemic, especially now that we’re a few years out from a <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/24065037/food-inflation-prices-grocery-boycott-carrefour-pepsico">period</a> of <a href="https://www.vox.com/business-and-finance/367103/inflation-report-cpi-ppi-us-economy-fed-rate-cut">high inflation</a>. A report from consumer watchdog Public Interest Research Group noted that, before the pandemic, a pack of 36 Charmin Ultra Soft <a href="https://pirg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-Year-Later-Comparing-Pre-Pandemic-Prices-to-Todays-on-Amazon-1.pdf">rolls cost $30.95 on Amazon</a>. At time of writing, the same pack <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charmin-Ultra-Family-Rolls-Regular/dp/B0024NUM9A">costs $59</a> on the site. (In December 2020, it was selling for as high as <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0024NUM9A?context=search&amp;cpf=amazon-new">$114.99</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most name-brand toilet paper today far exceeds Ly’s price threshold. A 30-pack of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Charmin-ULTRA-STRONG-Toilet-Tissue-Dry-2-Ply-Unscented/7397212016">Charmin Ultra Strong</a> mega rolls breaks down to 0.5 cents per sheet, though a 36-pack of <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Scott-1000-Toilet-Paper-36-Rolls-1-000-Sheets-per-Roll/209228848?classType=VARIANT&amp;athbdg=L1103">Scott 1000 toilet paper</a> is about 0.083 cents per sheet. <a href="https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-bath-tissue%2C-2-ply%2C-380-sheets%2C-30-rolls.product.100645583.html">Kirkland’s 30-pack</a> of toilet paper, selling for $23.49 at time of writing, works out to 0.206 cents per sheet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-02-10/housing-market-making-toilet-paper-more-expensive">cost of making toilet paper</a> may have gone up in recent years, according to the Los Angeles Times, due to a slowdown in lumber production (there’s less available wood pulp, which is what most toilet paper is made of). Combine that with the fact that, as journalist Will Oremus reported in a piece about the <a href="https://marker.medium.com/what-everyones-getting-wrong-about-the-toilet-paper-shortage-c812e1358fe0">pandemic toilet paper shortage</a>, more people are working remotely today, reducing the time spent in office bathrooms. It means that the average consumer is using more toilet paper at home, cringing at how much their budget for bathroom products has gone up. </p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Shrinkflation strikes – again</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Toilet paper manufacturers have come up with a way to keep prices roughly the same, though — at least at a quick glance. The same pack of toilet paper you buy every month might only be more expensive upon close scrutiny of the fine print, when you realize each roll is made up of fewer sheets. A recent analysis by loan marketplace LendingTree showed that toilet paper was among the top offenders among products whose size or volume had <a href="https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/study/shrinkflation-report/">shrunk since 2019 or 2020</a>. A pack of 12 mega rolls from Angel Soft went from 429 sheets per roll to 320 — essentially shrinking by a quarter — but at least the price went down by 15 percent too. Charmin Ultra Strong mega rolls, on the other hand, shrank by 15 percent while the price increased by 11 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This isn’t a new strategy that only toilet paper makers are employing. People have been complaining about <a href="https://www.prwatch.org/spin/2008/11/7971/sneaky-manufacturers-shrink-packaging-while-keeping-prices-same?page=3">product shrinkage</a> <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/business/analysis-and-features/toilet-paper-rolls-in-the-us-are-steadily-shrinking-this-is-why-10005455.html">for years</a>; a <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/08/the-dirty-little-secrets-of-toilet-paper/index.htm">Consumer Reports article from 2015</a> compared toilet paper rolls from top brands, showing that some had reduced by over 20 percent. The reason, manufacturers claimed at the time, was that better paper quality meant that people could use less of it.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>An older Charmin regular roll had 82 sheets versus just 55 today.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Edgar Dworsky, a former consumer protection lawyer, has been tracking this shady practice — which he calls “<a href="https://www.mouseprint.org/category/downsiz/">downsizing</a>” — for decades on his websites, <a href="http://mouseprint.org">MousePrint.org</a> and <a href="http://consumerworld.org">ConsumerWorld.org</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I remember back in the 1960s when my Mounds candy bar used to be two ounces and became one point something or other,” he tells Vox. He notes that old Charmin toilet paper had as many as <a href="https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/vintage-nos-charmin-toilet-paper-650-1821062730">650 sheets</a> in a single-ply roll; its mega-XXL today has just 440 sheets. An older Charmin regular roll had 82 sheets versus just 55 today. The playbook is to shrink the current roll size, then invent a new tier (with a more ridiculous name) that can be priced higher.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consumer brands “are in the business of making you think you’re getting more,” Dworsky says. “It’s all a name game, it’s all a numbers game, and if you’re just oblivious to it, you’re going to get snookered.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How to avoid flushing money down the toilet</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Toilet paper is marketed both as a value product, where you’re getting four rolls for the price of one, and a weirdly indulgent luxury at the same time. It’s something meant to be quickly disposed of, literally flushed away, yet commercials for toilet paper are almost always focusing on its delightful, cushiony softness or a special “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJfeviFUcyw">quilted</a>” or “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU03x43pTT4">diamond weave</a>” texture that adds a premium feel to the product. There’s scented toilet paper, and even toilet paper with colorful patterns. One of Quilted Northern’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpXtAhiKHBE">April Fool’s Day ads</a> pokes fun at the excessive promotional style of its own industry, proclaiming a “return” to hand-crafted, artisanal toilet paper.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, this is because we spend so much time with it, and in such an intimate way, so such bells and whistles do matter to some of us. “There’s obviously some people [who], for medical reasons, like to have really soft toilet paper,” Saunders says. “Some people just like extra strong toilet paper.” For others, it’s a pure bang-for-buck play, where they might just gravitate toward the pack with the most rolls (which isn’t necessarily the best value). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The range of options, from one-ply sparseness to lilac-scented plushness, isn’t the problem. It’s that it’s so hard to disentangle the value you’re actually getting. As Dworsky notes, consumers could bring a scale to weigh packs of toilet paper every time they go to the store, but then what can you do about it? You still have to buy one of the #ShrinkFlated options, and it’s not an area where we’re spoiled for choice. While there are plenty of different versions that a single brand offers, just three manufacturers — Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly-Clark, and Georgia-Pacific — make up some 80 percent of the bathroom tissue market.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One could switch to commercial-grade toilet paper, which is much cheaper but is of (ahem) crappier quality. Where consumer toilet paper is soft, perhaps <a href="https://www.charmin.com/en-us/shop-products/ultra-gentle-toilet-paper-with-lotion">infused with lotion</a>, often embossed with a delightful little pattern, the stuff we see in public restrooms is stiff and so thin that it breaks apart if you so much as look at it. Still, a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/General-Supply-3-3-in-x-700-ft-2-Ply-Jumbo-Roll-Bath-Tissue-in-White-12-Carton-GEN9JUMBOB/305772552">12-pack of commercial toilet paper</a> at Home Depot is about $34 at time of writing, and one roll is about 700 feet long. Assuming that a square of consumer-grade toilet paper is about 4 inches long, a 440-sheet Charmin mega-XXL roll would still be under 147 feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-dean-press-cocacola-pepsico-and-general-mills-on-shrinkflation-price-gouging-and-tax-dodging">Lawmakers</a> and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/07/fact-sheet-president-biden-is-taking-action-to-lower-costs-for-families-and-fight-corporate-rip-offs/">President Joe Biden</a> have wagged their fingers at corporations for shrinkflation and have even <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3819/text">introduced a bill</a> attempting to ban the practice, though neither Dworsky nor Bell thinks it’s likely to become law. But more transparency around product sizes, more consistent unit price labels, or even requiring a consumer notice when there’s a change in size would go a long way to help shoppers. Last year, in the lead-up to price negotiations with suppliers, French grocery chain Carrefour <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/14/carrefour-puts-shrinkflation-price-warnings-on-food-to-shame-brands">started attaching labels</a> next to packaged foods and drinks that had gotten smaller. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s certain is that the deceptive, confusing accounting of toilet paper rolls shouldn’t be the norm — and, in fact, it appears to be mostly a North American tradition. While other countries do also sell “mega” rolls, there’s <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/search?query=toilet+paper&amp;inputType=free+text">no</a> <a href="https://groceries.morrisons.com/search?q=toilet%20paper">fiddly</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.de/s?k=toilet+paper&amp;crid=KUAE7ZR6KPML&amp;sprefix=toilet+pape%2Caps%2C163&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">math</a> <a href="https://www.woolworths.co.nz/shop/searchproducts?search=toilet%20paper">on</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/s?k=toilet+paper&amp;crid=2M08DIZBDIX37&amp;sprefix=toi%2Caps%2C934&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2">the</a> <a href="https://www.carrefour.fr/s?q=papier+toilette">packaging</a> insisting that a dozen rolls are somehow more than that. Toilet paper is no small matter, especially for Americans. Per capita, the US is the No. 1 consumer of it in the world, each American using about <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/15676/cmo-toilet-paper-consumption/">141 rolls per year</a> as of 2018. A Consumer Reports buying guide once compared the annual usage to the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/toilet-paper/buying-guide/">length of 23 football fields</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One way to avoid the frustrating morass of counting rolls and sheets is to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2024/03/18/pandemic-covid-bidet-sales/">opt out of the game</a> altogether. “I switched to a bidet 10 years ago,” Dworsky says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Welcome to the golden age of STI prevention.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sure, condoms are still an effective strategy for lowering the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — but now, they’re just one of a smorgasbord of strategies for decreasing your chances of catching an infection spread by sex.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That includes vaccines to lower your risk of certain STIs, and medications you can take to prevent infection — some with the ease of a morning-after pill, and many that can be mailed to your home after an online telehealth visit. It also includes new STI tests that people can take in their homes, with results available either instantly or within days to enable quick and discreet testing and treatment. In a world where getting sexual health care sometimes feels fraught with judgment, these new methods offer a level of discretion and convenience that feels nothing short of revolutionary.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In-person care is still best for getting the most comprehensive and personalized evaluation and education, and we’ve got guidance on how to find that kind of care <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/355132/sexual-health-care-stds-stis-birth-control-contraception-how-to-doctor-provider-clinic">here</a>. But even sexual health care clinicians recognize it’s annoying — <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/apc.2018.0114">or worse</a> — to go to the doctor sometimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Inconvenience — whether it&#8217;s cost, or travel, or parking, or taking off work, or other competing demands — is probably a big factor in why people aren&#8217;t necessarily engaged in … sexual health care that they might otherwise benefit from,” says <a href="https://www.populationmedicine.org/dkrakower">Douglas Krakower</a>, an infectious disease doctor and HIV prevention researcher at Harvard Medical School. Stigma — that shameful sense that people who know you have an STI look down on you, whether real or imagined — also sometimes prevents people from getting high-quality sexual health care in person.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line: People often prefer sexual health care that involves as few other humans as possible. Now, there are more ways to get that than ever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not everyone gets to benefit equally from these advances. Some come with hefty out-of-pocket price tags or are still out of reach for pregnant or likely-to-be-pregnant people. Still, the changes represent a leap forward in an area of health care that needs as much help as it can get.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s what’s out there.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>You can greatly reduce your risk of HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and more&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">STIs include a range of bacteria and viruses that cause unpleasant genital symptoms, threaten your ability to have pleasurable sex, and may endanger your ability to have healthy children. Barrier protections like internal and external <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/condoms/">condoms</a> are still the best (and usually cheapest) way to protect yourself from STIs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, if you anticipate having sex without condoms, there are now lots of other ways to prevent STIs. Vaccines have come a long way and <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/vaccines/">several can prevent STIs</a>, including HPV (a cause of genital warts and cervical cancer), mpox, and hepatitis A and B. Recent studies also suggest being vaccinated against meningitis can offer some <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(24)00031-8/abstract">gonorrhea protection</a>, especially among gay men and the people they have sex with.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also pills and injectable medications that can greatly reduce the risk a sexual partner will infect you with HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">HIV prevention is available in a few forms: as a daily oral or every-two-months injectable medication you take <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/hiv-prevention-prep/">before sex</a> (called PrEP, for pre-exposure prophylaxis), or as a month-long regimen of oral medicines you take immediately after sex. The latter option, called <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/prevention/pep.html">PEP</a>, for post-exposure prophylaxis, has to be started within 72 hours of exposure to be effective. Both options work by entering the body’s cells and preventing HIV from replicating inside them.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s even more progress to come in this area: An every-six-months injectable drug for preventing HIV infection called lenacapavir has shown huge promise in preventing HIV infections in both <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2407001">women</a> and <a href="https://avac.org/press-release/purpose-2/">trans and nonbinary people</a> and could be available for US use as soon as <a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2024/gileads-twiceyearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-reduced-hiv-infections-by-96-and-demonstrated-superiority-to-daily-truvada">late 2025</a>. Krakower says an oral option isn’t far behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Syphilis has been rising explosively in the US for the past few years, affecting gay men and the people they have sex with as well as heterosexual men and women, especially those whose sexual partners include sex workers and people who inject drugs. The trend has huge stakes: Women can spread syphilis to their pregnancies, leading to serious illness or death in their newborns. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidelines for using <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/doxy-pep-is-a-new-strategy-to-help-prevent-stis/">doxyPEP</a>, a <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/10/25/23402228/doxypep-doxycycline-pep-morning-after-sti-chlamydia-syphilis">morning-after pill to prevent syphilis infection</a>. This breakthrough strategy involves taking the antibiotic doxycycline the morning after sex — and because this medication also fights other germs, doxyPEP also reduces gonorrhea and chlamydia transmission.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem is that doxycycline’s effects on pregnancy are unclear, but there’s suspicion they’re <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4898140/">not good.</a> Many clinicians are therefore hesitant to prescribe it to younger patients in their care.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, because congenital syphilis has become such a dire national emergency, scientists are seeking ways doxyPEP can protect pregnant people and their fetuses. One focus is getting more men who have sex with men and women to use doxyPEP; another approach may involve prescribing the drug to women at high risk of syphilis infection. In a Japanese study of <a href="https://www.natap.org/2024/IAS/IAS_14.htm">female sex workers</a>, this strategy led to plummeting syphilis and chlamydia rates.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>You can get at-home testing for a range of STIs&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It used to be that if you’d had unprotected sex with a new partner or had unusual genital symptoms — like painful urination, funky discharge, or skin changes like a bump, ulcer, or rash — you’d have to jump through a lot of hoops to figure out whether you had an STI. You would start by visiting a clinic or emergency room; getting your parts swabbed by a clinician (or peeing in a cup or getting blood drawn); waiting for a lab to process those results; waiting for the doctor’s office to communicate those results to you; going back to the clinic for medicine or picking it up at a pharmacy; and then potentially going back again to be retested once treatment was done. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, a variety of new testing options allows clinics to get test results within hours for a range of STIs. Once these get adopted broadly by clinics and emergency rooms, it’ll be a lot easier for people to get testing and treatment all in the space of one health care visit. Hopefully, that will lower the number of people who get diagnosed with an STI but never get treated for it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another huge step forward: New tests now enable people to do most or all of the STI testing and treatment process at home, online, or through the mail — without a doctor or another clinician having to get involved. “Agency is what home testing gets people,” says <a href="https://profiles.hopkinsmedicine.org/provider/yuka-c-manabe/2707088">Yuka Manabe</a>, an infectious disease doctor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine who leads the home-based HIV and STI testing program, <a href="https://iwantthekit.org/">I Want the Kit</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The FDA has only approved a handful of these tests, and they’re not perfect. For example, the only FDA-approved test that screens for chlamydia and gonorrhea with home-based sample collection is the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-grants-marketing-authorization-first-test-chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-home-sample-collection">Simple 2</a> test —  it’s only approved to test samples from penises and vaginas. That means the test <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/sexual-health/-home-sti-testing-work-fda-clears-first-self-test-gonorrhea-chlamydia-rcna125994">can’t be used to diagnose throat and rectal infections</a>, which are more common in men exposed through oral or anal sex with other men. So while the Simple 2 is a great choice for people who engage only in heterosexual sex, it leaves out gay men and people they have sex with. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another important innovation is the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-marketing-authorization-enables-increased-access-first-step-syphilis-diagnosis">First to Know</a> Syphilis Test, which can detect within minutes syphilis-fighting antibodies in blood samples <a href="https://firsttoknow.com/">collected at home</a> with a simple skin prick. The FDA approved the test in August. However, it has a catch: The test doesn’t distinguish between new syphilis infections and old, already-treated infections. That means people who’ve had syphilis before can’t use the test to rule out a new infection.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth noting that home-use HIV tests have been FDA-approved for <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/approved-blood-products/oraquick-home-hiv-test">more than a decade</a>, although they also require follow-up testing for positive results.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just because these tests are FDA-approved doesn’t guarantee they are covered by insurance; you can check with your insurer to find out what it will cost you. If it’s not covered, it’s worth checking to see if you live in a part of the country where free HIV, gonorrhea and chlamydia, or trichomonas test kits are available (the <a href="https://www.ashasexualhealth.org/testing-for-stis-at-home/">American Sexual Health Association</a> lists free HIV and STI home test kit resources).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of this testing would be free or low-cost if you got it in person, says <a href="https://www.ncsddc.org/about/our-staff/">Elizabeth Finley</a>, the senior director of communications and programs at the National Coalition of STD Directors. “There’s some equity implications” in the reality that higher-income people can afford to pay out of pocket for the convenience of home-based testing, while lower-income people often cannot, she says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Choosing a test is just the beginning</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An array of companies have created <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/free-home-sti-test#A-quick-look-at-the-best-free-or-low-cost-STI-tests">home-based STI tests</a> that haven’t yet been approved by the FDA, including ones for <a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/hepatitis-b-test">hepatitis B</a> <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hepatitis-c-screening">and C</a>, which are often overlooked. Non-approval doesn’t mean a test is garbage — it just makes it harder to be certain that it’s effective at doing what you want it to do.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are no real guardrails for the companies in terms of the quality they have to offer to customers,” Finley says. “The tests have to work, but I&#8217;m not sure customers are fully informed about, if they see a test available on social media, ‘Is this a good one? Is this a bad one?’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The appeal of these tests is strong for people who hate having someone else get their genital sample. Many of them have you pee in a cup, pinprick your own finger and blot blood on a card, or swab a range of body parts at home (including your vagina or penis, your butt, or your throat), then mail that sample to a lab that runs the usual tests on it, which can be retrieved in an online portal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Home testing kits also often make an end-run around the process of getting to a brick-and-mortar clinic to figure out next steps or pick up medication. Many use a telehealth platform to connect people who test positive for an STI with clinicians, who can provide counseling, suggest ways to get partners tested, and mail some medications directly to patients.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Curing many STIs requires one or more antibiotic injections, and experts sometimes recommend additional evaluation after a diagnosis. Both of these scenarios require an in-person visit with a clinician. If you test positive for one of these STIs, your test company’s telehealth provider should direct you to a clinic where you can see an in-person clinician.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Giving people the option of self-directed sexual health care isn’t just good for people’s sense of autonomy — it’s also a sensible response to impending health worker shortages. Out of concern for an inadequate global supply of clinicians, the World Health Organization has recently recommended a <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240052192">range of self-care interventions</a> for people all over the world, among them many of the latest innovations in STI self-sampling and testing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s about time, Manabe says: “We’re not trusting the public enough.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the weekend, a very small wildfire broke out in a hilly and densely vegetated area of Prospect Park, a swath of green space in Brooklyn. The 2-acre blaze drew about 100 firefighters as residents were warned to stay out of the park. Meanwhile, on the New York-New Jersey border, another blaze, the Jennings Creek wildfire, has burned thousands of acres, sending smoke drifting across much of New York City and killing an 18-year-old New York state forest ranger volunteer who <a href="https://amp-cnn-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/11/10/us/new-york-wildfire-death?amp_js_v=0.1&amp;amp_gsa=1#webview=1">died while responding to the fire</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is this typical? Not exactly. But the Northeast has been under severe drought conditions for weeks. These fires, and the dozens of others currently burning in the Northeast and across the Ohio River Valley, as well as the scores more in the Western US, are the consequence of months of unseasonably hot and dry weather across large swaths of the country. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Okay, pause: What <em>is</em> a drought? Simply put, a drought is a dry period — that is, a long stretch of time without any rain or snow — that leads to a water shortage. Droughts can (and do) happen all over the world; they are not just a characteristic of a desert or a regional problem. Extreme drought can stress landscapes and water tables, regardless of whether a city is built on top of them or not. If a drought lasts long enough, <a href="https://www.vox.com/24152402/mexico-city-day-zero-water-resource-management-solutions">people in that place can lose access to water</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the Western United States is associated with aridity, it is remarkable to see this extent of drought spread across the Northeast. And current forecasts show that the conditions will persist for weeks or even months. “It’s problematic to see drought in all parts of the country. It’s not just a regional issue,” said <a href="https://drought.unl.edu/AboutUs/WhoWeAre.aspx?id=8">Brian Fuchs</a>, a climatologist with the National Drought Mitigation Center. “Regardless of where you’re at, drought can and will impact you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Firefighters extinguished the Prospect Park fire. Rain mercifully moved into New York on Sunday night and snuffed much of the smoke drifting across the East Coast, obscuring the fact that a cluster of fires in New Jersey continued to burn.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the smoke fades, attention shouldn’t: Millions of people in the Northeast remain under red flag wildfire warnings, which signal conditions where anything that can generate a spark could likely lead to a fire. But we all live with drought, extreme heat, and fire now — and our relationship to water is connected to just how bad things could get.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/GettyImages-2183348826.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.785131724411,100,78.429736551177" alt="Five people and two dogs stand across the water from a mountain on fire at night." title="Five people and two dogs stand across the water from a mountain on fire at night." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="People watch as a wildfire burns and spreads on a mountain in West Milford, New Jersey, on November 9, 2024. | Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Kyle Mazza/Anadolu via Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Why is the drought so severe?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For much of the country, October was an extremely hot and dry month. We are currently on pace for 2024 to become the hottest year ever recorded, a declaration that forecasters from the World Meteorological Organization are <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/2024-track-be-hottest-year-record-warming-temporarily-hits-15degc">making with confidence</a> even with more than a month left. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.drought.gov/current-conditions">According to the US Drought Monitor</a>, the long periods of hot and dry conditions have left every state in the country facing drought — an unprecedented statistic. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There isn’t a single driver responsible for the scope of the current drought conditions. Even as our global average temperatures <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/chapter-1/#:~:text=The%20Anthropocene%3A%20Strengthening%20the%20Global%20Response%20to%201.5%C2%B0C%20Global%20Warming&amp;text=14-,.,et%20al.%2C%202013).">are rising</a> thanks to climate change, our short-term weather patterns will shift all of the time. For example, despite Hurricane Helene bringing heaps of moisture to places like North Carolina a little more than a month ago, even western North Carolina is now abnormally dry. How can that be? Because it&#8217;s been that hot and dry in the weeks since — enough to erase any sign of a so-called <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/17/carolina-beach-flooding-unnamed-storm/">thousand-year event</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When I started looking at data over the past six months, you see that places like New Jersey, the Ohio River Valley, much of the plains have 12 to 15 inches below normal precipitation for this time of the year,” Fuchs said. “New York has a deficit of 10 inches. That’s very extreme for this part of the country.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there are these warmer temperatures later in the year that end up amplifying the ongoing drought’s worst effects. Temperatures usually fall significantly by November. Trees will drop their leaves and go dormant. Certain critters hibernate or go into low-power mode. Snow begins accumulating in the higher elevations, banking moisture that will melt out — gradually — during the warmer periods.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when it’s 80 degrees in New York in November, trees and vegetation are still consuming water. There’s an extra period of demand on the overall water system, and that taxes water sources — lakes and streams begin to draw down and the ground holds onto less moisture. Vegetation that grew earlier in the year begins to dry out —&nbsp;and fuel wildfires.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It really doesn’t take much time to transition to a hot and dry environment and you all of a sudden have all of this extra fuel for wildfires,” Fuchs said. “This is the perfect mix for fires to blossom.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Should we expect more wildfires?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Drought is a normal part of our climate, but it’s not normal<em> </em>to see this much drought across so much of the country. </p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resources to help you understand how drought will impact where you live</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two monitors produced by the US Drought Monitor from the Climate Prediction Center that reflect what areas in the US will be most affected by drought and water scarcity. These projections, which update regularly, give a real-time pulse on conditions across the country and are created through a partnership between the US Department of Agriculture and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These tools are also  helpful in getting a clearer picture of how the climate is impacting your local landscape and will give you the heads-up if you’re likely to face water shortages.</p>



<ol>
<li><a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/ConditionsOutlooks/Outlooks.aspx">The monthly outlook</a> is a great snapshot for this moment in time. It provides a gradient of drought conditions, shaded by severity, impacting the country. If you live in a place where drought is persisting, conserve your water and be aware of acute wildfire risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/ConditionsOutlooks/Outlooks.aspx">The seasonal outlook</a> currently shows projection through January 2025 and will update again in mid-November to show conditions expected to the end of February. This map is helpful for getting a longer-range view of aridity and whether it’s likely to lessen or become more severe.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This extreme period of dry weather is a part of the larger picture that scientists have come to expect: that our weather will become more extreme and unpredictable and that we will collectively experience more pronounced swings from incredibly dry periods to incredibly wet periods.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those dry periods, Fuchs says, are connected to warmer temperatures persisting into what should be the colder parts of the year and ramping up the demand on our water systems.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That demand, by the way, includes water consumption by you and me and everyone else. Just multiply our daily showers, drawing from the tap, running our dishwashers and washing machines, washing our cars, watering our house plants (and so on) by the millions of people who live in a watershed, the area that shares a single water source for a particular region.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If there’s too much demand on an already stressed landscape, the wildfire risk increases as water levels in streams and in our water table drop.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To better navigate the conditions we see today and the climate we should expect in the future, we need to understand that no place is immune to drought conditions, Fuchs said. “Even if you think you’ve not been impacted by drought in the past, it’s increasingly important for people to know where their water comes from and conserve it the best you can at any time,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re actively experiencing severe climate change impacts,” said <a href="https://www.ioes.ucla.edu/person/aradhna-tripati/">Aradhna Tripati</a>, a climate scientist from UCLA who helped author the <a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/">latest national climate assessment</a>. Climate change “is no longer theoretical or a distant threat, an abstract one. It is not something that happens in the future here. It is not something only happening in places far away from where we live. All weather is now being affected.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes — even in New York City.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the war in Gaza began, the threat of a protest vote — in which voters would choose to abstain from the presidential election or vote for third-party candidates who had no shot of winning — hung over Democrats’ heads because of President Joe Biden’s unconditional support for Israel and its right-wing government. When Vice President Kamala Harris became the nominee, her lack of willingness to distance herself from Biden on this issue didn’t help alleviate that threat. Meanwhile, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/6/28/trump-calls-biden-a-bad-palestinian-in-us-presidential-debate-jab">accused Democrats</a> of not being sufficiently pro-Israel.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the election, pro-Palestinian voters tried to pressure Biden to change course, organizing protests on college campuses across the country and forming various campaigns to punish him at the ballot box. One group, the Uncommitted National Movement, asked Democratic voters to cast their ballots for “uncommitted” instead of Biden during the primaries, and they amassed hundreds of thousands of votes — <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/22/nx-s1-5048065/will-the-democrats-uncommitted-delegates-support-kamala-harris">enough to secure delegates</a> at the Democratic National Convention (DNC).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But no matter how much pro-Palestinian voters pushed candidates to give them a better vision for how to end the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, none were willing to meaningfully address the concerns of pro-Palestinian voters. And for Americans who regarded Gaza as one of their top concerns, their choice <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/381550/arab-americans-protest-vote-harris-gaza-palestine-israel">boiled down to either</a> punishing Democrats or stopping Trump. The result was an election in which neither outcome would have been a win for Palestinians.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it’s impossible to point to any single issue to explain why Harris lost to Trump, it’s clear <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/11/06/dearborn-michigan-rashida-tlaib-kamala-harris-gaza/">Harris lost at least some voters</a> because of the Biden administration’s stance on Gaza. And now Trump, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/16/us/politics/trump-gaza-refugees-travel-ban.html">vowed to ban</a> Palestinian refugees from entering the United States and said <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-hamas-war-trump-strip-student-visas-anti-semitic-foreigners-2023-10">he would revoke visas</a> from foreign students who are deemed antisemitic, is the president-elect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Voters wanted an actual plan to stop the war. Candidates weren’t interested</strong>.</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it came to which candidate had a better vision for how to end the war in Gaza, neither Biden, Harris, nor Trump offered a compelling message.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden offered Israel <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/politics/joe-biden-israel-trip/index.html">unqualified support</a>, sending billions of dollars in military aid. His administration defended Israel even as it committed horrific war crimes, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-16/biden-backs-israel-s-hospital-raid-hopeful-on-hostage-release">including hospital bombings</a>. Instead of reckoning with the rapidly rising death toll in Gaza, he <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-says-he-has-no-confidence-palestinian-death-count-2023-10-26/">cast doubt</a> on the numbers that the Gaza Ministry of Health had put out — numbers that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/despite-bidens-doubts-humanitarian-agencies-consider-gaza-toll-reliable-2023-10-27/">humanitarian groups</a> and even the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/24/gaza-death-toll-palestinian-health-ministry/">US government had deemed</a> reliable in the past.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At times, Harris, after she became the Democratic nominee, tried calling out Israel for the staggering death toll, saying that <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0lx2xgn55o">“far too many” civilians</a> had been killed and emphasizing that <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/harris-vows-to-always-give-israel-the-ability-to-defend-itself-says-gaza-war-must-end/">how Israel conducted itself</a> during this war mattered. She called for an end to the war, but after having served in the administration that financed Israel’s war with virtually no conditions, it wasn’t a particularly convincing message.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris also muddied her outreach — or lack thereof — to Arab Americans by coupling any sympathetic statement about Palestinians with a staunch defense of Israel. At her DNC speech, for example, she said the death toll in Gaza was “<a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/368462/kamala-harris-israel-palestine-gaza-dnc-speech">heartbreaking</a>” and that Palestinians’ right to self-determination ought to be realized — reiterating long-held US talking points — but also prefaced that statement by again justifying the war itself. When she was asked whether she was worried about losing Arab American voters because of Israel’s conduct, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/harris-the-first-and-most-tragic-story-coming-out-of-gaza-is-oct-7-onslaught/">she said</a>, “There are so many tragic stories coming from Gaza,” but that “the first and most tragic story is October 7.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For his part, Trump didn’t try to say he would be any better than Biden on Gaza. Earlier this year, he said Israel should wrap up the war and “<a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-gaza-israel-policy-war-b2524136.html">get back to peace and stop killing people</a>.” But he said it not in the context of sympathy for Palestinians, but out of concern that Israel was making itself look bad. “And the other thing is I hate — they put out tapes all the time. Every night, they’re releasing tapes of a building falling down. They shouldn’t be releasing tapes like that,” he <a href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-gaza-israel-policy-war-b2524136.html">said</a>. “That’s why they’re losing the PR war.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also seemed more concerned about the lost opportunity for development in Gaza than the human suffering, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/19/jared-kushner-gaza-waterfront-property-israel-negev">saying</a> that the strip’s waterfront properties could be very valuable. “There was no ocean as far as that was concerned. They never took advantage of it,” <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-gaza-oceanfront-comments-rebuild-israel-2024-10">Trump said</a>. “You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place — the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As to how Trump would deal with Benjamin Netanyahu, he indicated that he would let the Israeli prime minister be even more unrestrained, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/187332/trump-biden-tough-netanyahu">saying Netanyahu</a> was “doing a good job” and that Biden was holding him back.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Throughout the election, Palestinians were a target</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, whether Trump would end up being worse than Biden or Harris on this issue didn’t necessarily resonate with pro-Palestinian voters. For them, what’s been happening over the last year already represented the worst. Israel, after all, has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/26/1227078791/icj-israel-genocide-gaza-palestinians-south-africa">already been credibly accused</a> of genocide at the International Court of Justice. As one Georgia voter told me in the week before the election, “In no way do I imagine Trump is better for Palestine … [but] I can’t imagine it worse.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That helps explain why so many Arab Americans came out against Harris on Election Day. In Dearborn, Michigan, an <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2023/09/26/arab-americans-now-a-majority-in-dearborn-new-census-data-shows/70929525007/">Arab-majority city</a>, Trump <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/11/06/dearborn-michigan-rashida-tlaib-kamala-harris-gaza/">won 43 percent of the vote</a> compared to Harris’s 36 percent. In 2020, Biden won the city with 69 percent of the vote, and though Harris lost there, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American, won her reelection to Congress with 62 percent of the vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As much as this issue resonated with many voters, America’s politicians were not ready to rethink the country’s relationship with Israel, even as the war escalated to the point where now over <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/longform/2023/10/9/israel-hamas-war-in-maps-and-charts-live-tracker">44,000 Palestinians have been killed</a>. In July, when Netanyahu gave an address to Congress, he was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/24/nx-s1-5048793/netanyahu-met-with-standing-ovation-and-protest-over-joint-meeting-of-congress">met with a standing ovation</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the start, Palestinians were a target in this election. During the Republican primaries, candidates got on the debate stage and competed over <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/gop-presidential-candidates-compete-seen-closest-israel-debate-rcna124311">who would be the most pro-Israel president</a>. At that point, it had been a month since Hamas’s October 7 attack, and Israel’s war on Gaza had already <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/reuters-next-un-chief-says-gaza-deaths-show-something-wrong-with-israel-2023-11-08/">killed over 10,000 Palestinians</a>, 40 percent of whom were children. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he would tell Netanyahu to “finish the job once and for all with these butchers,” referring to Hamas. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott said, “You cannot negotiate with evil.” Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley repeated a line she had already tested out on the campaign trail: “Finish them.” She would later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nikki-haley-writes-finish-them-israeli-artillery-shell-drawing-criticism-2024-05-29/">write that on an artillery shell</a> during a visit to Israel. As for Trump, he <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2024/07/trump-racist-insult-palestinian-schumer/678902/">even hurled the word</a> “Palestinian” as an insult.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At each turn, no matter how devastating the war became, Palestinians were humiliated. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/biden-condemns-antisemitic-protests-palestine-columbia-university/">Pro-Palestinian protesters</a> were <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hillary-clinton-anti-israel-protesters-dont-know-very-much-about-the-middle-east/">denigrated</a>. And voters who sympathized with Palestinians in Gaza <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/31/bill-clinton-criticised-for-saying-israel-forced-to-kill-gaza-civilians">were scolded</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That left voters with no tangible options to improve the situation in Gaza at the ballot box, prompting many to believe that the best way to be heard is by sending a message that reckless foreign policy will cost incumbents votes. Even as <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/381550/arab-americans-protest-vote-harris-gaza-palestine-israel">some voters tried</a> to turn the election into a referendum on Biden’s Gaza policy, the reality was that no candidate was willing to promise anything beyond the status quo. So Palestinians and their supporters found plenty of reason to believe that whatever the election outcome would be, it could only range from bad to worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That feeling of hopelessness paved the way for a protest vote to take hold. While Biden’s Israel policy, in the end, might not have been the deciding factor for much of the electorate, in some pockets of the country, voters tried to show that they shouldn’t be ignored in the only way they could: by voting against the party that allowed Gaza to turn into a “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/gaza-graveyard-for-children-un-chief-warns-intl-hnk/index.html">graveyard for children.</a>”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s hard to know what the next few months, or next four years, will look like for Palestine. But there aren’t many signs of hope — if there are any at all. As the election drew to a close, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/06/palestinians-will-not-be-allowed-to-return-to-homes-in-northern-gaza-says-idf">Israelis announced</a> they are nearing a “full evacuation” of northern Gaza and that “there is no intention” to allow Palestinians to return. That sounds like only the beginning of a new phase in the war. ​​</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump has begun naming members of his White House team, offering an early signal to the direction he’ll take on issues, including foreign policy and immigration. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus far, Trump has announced a handful of policy staffers, nominating House GOP Conference chair Elise Stefanik as United Nations ambassador, and former Rep. Lee Zeldin as Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator. Trump has also named former Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Tom Homan as his choice for “border czar” and is set to announce longstanding policy adviser Stephen Miller as a deputy chief of staff. Stefanik has been a staunch Israel supporter, and Zeldin has emphasized his desire to roll back environmental regulations. Homan and Miller, meanwhile, are known for their hard-line stances on immigration, including overseeing family separations during Trump’s first administration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many other nominations — including for powerful Cabinet positions like secretaries of state and defense — are still to come. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump described a range of priorities while on the campaign trail, including promises of <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation">mass deportations</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/2/9/24064244/trump-economy-china-tarriffs-today-explained">expansive tariffs</a>, and cuts to <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/lgbtq/4656405-donald-trump-transgender-students-athletes-title-ix-lgbtq/">protections for LGBTQ people</a>. It will be up to his secretaries and staff to execute these plans, with his picks thus far underscoring just how serious he is about pursuing many of these goals, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/11/trump-prepares-immigration-crackdown-with-miller-homan-posts/">particularly on immigration</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his first administration, many of Trump’s Cabinet members oversaw significant changes to the executive branch, including Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who were critical to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/10/labor-secretary-eugene-scalia-faces-blowback-he-curtails-scope-worker-relief-unemployment-crisis/">curtailing worker protections</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/19/936225974/the-legacy-of-education-secretary-betsy-devos">attempting massive cuts to education spending</a>, respectively. Trump has indicated he <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-wins-second-term-policies-de3dcf0f173b42602b258042fd7aaafb">wants to go further</a> and <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1855692242981155259">move faster this time around</a> and that he wants to ensure he’s <a href="https://www.reuters.com/default/donald-trump-staffs-up-second-term-only-maga-loyalists-need-apply-2024-11-11/">surrounded by like-minded staff</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is a rundown of the people Trump has named and the roles these appointees could play.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-2162329710.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Representative Elise Stefanik in a dark blue V-neck dress, standing and smiling in front of a microphone." title="Representative Elise Stefanik in a dark blue V-neck dress, standing and smiling in front of a microphone." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>House Rep. Elise Stefanik (NY) has been tapped for UN ambassador</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Once a moderate, Stefanik — currently part of Republican House leadership — has become a vocal Trump loyalist in recent years as her New York district shifted right.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/11/19/20966940/elise-stefanik-impeachment-hearing-donald-trump-adam-schiff">Stefanik first burst onto the national stage</a> as a member of the House Intelligence Committee, grilling witnesses as part of Trump’s first impeachment proceeding in the lower chamber in 2019. More recently, she went viral for her questioning of college presidents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/23/us/elise-stefanik-republican-antisemitism-hearings.html">during a hearing on antisemitism</a> and their handling of student protests over Gaza.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a top House Republican, Stefanik has amplified Trump’s 2020 election denials and hewed so close to the president-elect that she was once on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/9/24048591/trump-vice-president-pick">shortlist for the vice presidency</a>. Stefanik is also known for her <a href="https://www.vox.com/21262150/house-republican-women-candidates">efforts to recruit and support more Republican women</a> for House seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s taken a pretty standard conservative stance on foreign policy: Stefanik has been a prominent supporter of aid to Israel while balking at continuing support for Ukraine. She backed early tranches of Ukraine aid but joined other Republicans in arguing that more recent aid could be better applied domestically. Stefanik has previously questioned aid to the United Nations, including to its Relief and Works Agency, which has been vital to providing humanitarian aid to Gaza. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Elise is an incredibly strong, tough and smart America First fighter,” <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-chooses-rep-elise-stefanik-serve-us-ambassador-united-nations-rcna179558">Trump said in a statement about the role</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The UN ambassador serves as a vital envoy for US interests; given the country’s financial support for the body and its role on the UN Security Council, the ambassador has major influence regarding how the organization utilizes its resources and who serves in its leadership. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last year, UN officials have been increasingly critical of Israel’s attacks on Gaza as thousands have died, health care systems have been assaulted, and famine has struck. As ambassador, Stefanik could criticize these positions and call for defunding UN relief programs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This role requires Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>The pick suggests that the Trump administration could once again ramp up its disagreements with the United Nations, after attempting to <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/10/02/trump-stealthily-seeks-to-choke-off-funding-to-un-programs/">curb funding for certain UN initiatives</a> in Trump’s first term. At that time, the administration also pulled out of the UN Human Rights Council, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/us/politics/trump-israel-palestinians-human-rights.html">citing its criticisms of Israel</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stefanik’s naming could also underscore <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-ukraine-russia-war-threatens-cut-aid-election-2024/">the president-elect’s skepticism</a> of additional aid to Ukraine.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-961479096.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.727373918039,100,78.545252163922" alt="Tom Homan, sitting behind his name plate and speaking." title="Tom Homan, sitting behind his name plate and speaking." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Former ICE Acting Director Tom Homan has been named “border czar”&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Homan was acting ICE director during the first Trump administration and oversaw the implementation of the family separation policy during his tenure from 2017 to 2018. He’s also long backed <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-makes-tom-homan-father-of-family-separation-in-charge-of-mass-deportation/">Trump’s desire to deport unauthorized immigrants</a>, previously noting that if invited to join the administration, he intended to “<a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump">run the biggest deportation operation this country&#8217;s ever seen</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Homan worked for ICE during former President Barack Obama’s administration as well, and has also served as a police officer and Border Patrol agent. He’s been in lockstep with Trump on implementing punitive immigration policies and called <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tom-homan-trump-border-czar-what-to-know/">for ICE to deport a wide range of unauthorized immigrants</a>, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383845/trump-mass-deportations-immigration-family-separation">those who don’t have criminal histories</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,&#8221; Trump <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/11/nx-s1-5186522/tom-homan-border-czar-trump">wrote in a Truth Social post.</a> “There is nobody better at policing and controlling our Borders.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The “border czar” is not an official role that requires Senate confirmation; the secretary of homeland security is the actual Cabinet official overseeing the border. However, Homan appears poised to have a major say over policy and will weigh in on proposals at both the northern and southern borders, according to Trump. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Homan’s efforts in the first Trump administration and his commitment to sweeping deportations this term indicate that the president-elect is fully focused on his promise to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">remove a large number of unauthorized immigrants from the US</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/11/gettyimages-1464161119.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729399246567,100,78.541201506867" alt="Lee Zeldin sits quietly at a desk with his hands folded." title="Lee Zeldin sits quietly at a desk with his hands folded." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Roy Rochlin/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Former Rep. Lee Zeldin tapped as Environmental Protection Agency administrator</strong> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong>Zeldin is a former Republican House lawmaker who ran a failed campaign for the New York governor’s seat in 2022. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zeldin did not previously sit on committees focused on environmental policy in the House, and&nbsp;focused on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1134203429/new-york-governor-election-results-kathy-hochul-lee-zeldin">crime and inflation during his gubernatorial run</a>. That year, he came within a notably close margin of Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul as a Republican running in a traditionally blue state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Zeldin has said some of his <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-taps-lee-zeldin-lead-environmental-protection-agency-rcna179658">first priorities</a> will be to “roll back regulations that are forcing businesses to be able to struggle,” and to work on US “energy dominance.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The EPA is responsible for crafting policies that protect clean water and air, and also plays a major role in approving regulations to combat climate change. The administrator position is a Senate-confirmed role. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Trump promised to take a very different approach to the environment than the Biden administration, including by <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382679/trump-foreign-policy-america-first-tariffs-nato-alliance">exiting international climate agreements</a> and focusing on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy">expanding fossil fuel production</a>. Zeldin’s nomination suggests those promises will be a priority, as will <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/06/nx-s1-5181891/trump-win-climate-change-fossil-fuels-clean-energy">rescinding Biden-era environmental protections</a> that curbed carbon emissions for businesses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Trump policy aide Stephen Miller expected to be named deputy chief of staff and policy adviser</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who he is: </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/373479/stephen-miller-mass-deportation-camps-trump-agenda">Miller is a staunch Trump loyalist and policy adviser</a> who pushed many of the harshest immigration policies during the president-elect’s first term. He has advocated for a travel ban and family separations in the past, and he’s a chief architect and booster for the idea of the mass deportations Trump has promised this term as well.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They begin on Inauguration Day, as soon as he takes the oath of office,” <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/11/politics/stephen-miller-trump-administration/index.html">Miller has said of deportations.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has not yet formally announced the appointment, though Vice President-elect JD Vance has already <a href="https://x.com/JDVance/status/1856004703672324263">posted his congratulations to Miller</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>This position is another political appointment that doesn’t require Senate confirmation, but the role is set to focus heavily on providing Trump with policy guidance — likely focused on immigration, given Miller’s expertise. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Between this appointment and Homan’s, Trump has made clear that his <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/380582/mass-deportations-trump-history-alien-enemies">promised mass deportations</a> will be one of his top policy goals when he retakes office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Trump campaign adviser Susie Wiles has been named chief of staff</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who she is: </strong>Wiles, a longtime Florida campaign operative, helped run Trump’s 2016 campaign in the state and was a Trump senior national adviser in 2024. She’s heavily credited for the success he had during the Republican primary in 2024 and had previously aided Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis during his gubernatorial run in 2018 prior to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/09/ron-desantis-susie-wiles-reaction-00188586">falling out between the two</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wiles has also been a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/11/07/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-susie-wiles-00188391">corporate lobbyist</a> and worked with a spectrum of Republicans in the past, including former Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Florida Sen. Rick Scott.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Susie is tough, smart, innovative … universally admired and respected,” <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-susie-wiles-chief-of-staff/">Trump said in a statement</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What we know about the role: </strong>The chief of staff is effectively a gatekeeper who helps shape the president’s priorities and offers policy counsel. The position is the most prominent political appointee in the White House and is not Senate confirmed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/22/politics/trump-fascist-john-kelly/index.html">Trump’s former Chief of Staff John Kelly</a> has been a major Trump critic, describing him as a “fascist” who favors a “dictator approach.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What message this sends: </strong>Wiles <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/who-is-susie-wiles-the-woman-behind-trumps-historic-return-to-the-oval-office">has been credited</a> with professionalizing Trump’s campaign operations and reining in some of the chaos that has marked his past operations. That said, his campaign was still <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/30/trump-poisoning-the-blood-racism">rife with racist remarks</a> that echoed authoritarians as well as frequent lies <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/31/politics/donald-trump-kamala-harris-black-nabj/index.html">about former Vice President Kamala Harris’s </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mveuxlccbV0">policies and identity</a>. Kelly has said he <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/11/trump-susie-wiles-chief-staff-campaign/">attempted to restrain the president</a> during his first term, though it was still plagued by in-fighting and tumultuous policies on everything from climate to immigration. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President-elect Donald Trump is pushing for the next Senate majority leader to allow recess appointments, which would allow him to install some officials without Senate confirmation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Typically, the Senate must approve presidential nominations for high-level posts, including cabinet positions, ambassadorships, and inspector general jobs, in a process outlined in the US Constitution. This procedure is meant to be a check on presidential power — a way of ensuring officials directly elected by citizens can guard against the appointment of unqualified or corrupt personnel.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Constitution, however, also allows for “recess appointments,” a provision that aims to prevent prolonged government vacancies by allowing the president to install officials without Senate approval while Congress is not in session.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Using such recess appointments, Trump would be able to appoint whoever he’d like without giving the Senate the opportunity to question or object to the pick. Critics of the practice note that it increases the risk of unqualified, corrupt, or ideological appointees filling government posts. It also significantly expands presidential power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though recess appointments have been used in the past by presidents of both parties, in recent years, the Senate has avoided going to extended recesses, blocking presidents from making any appointments in senators’ absence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reinstating recess appointments “would essentially negate one of the Senate&#8217;s main roles in governance, which is to vet presidential nominations for high-level positions,” Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, told Vox. “It would, if the Republicans in the Senate were willing to go along with it, represent sort of an abdication; they would be simply giving up the power that’s afforded them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump injected his demand into the fierce race to replace Sen. Mitch McConnell as the leader of the Senate, which will be under GOP control next session thanks to the results of last week’s election. Trump largely stayed out of that contest while on the campaign trail, but he waded into it on Sunday, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1855692242981155259">writing on X</a>, “Any Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!)”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The three candidates for the position —&nbsp;Sens. John Thune (South Dakota), John Cornyn (Texas), and Rick Scott (Florida) — quickly <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4983721-trump-senate-recess-appointments-gop-support/">expressed support for Trump’s demand</a>. Scott, the underdog in the race who is also the closest Trump ally of the three, was the most explicit in his endorsement of the plan, writing “100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible,” <a href="https://x.com/SenRickScott/status/1855693759281053758">on X.</a></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s a recess appointment and how does it work?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In ordinary circumstances, nominees to many government posts including cabinet secretaries, ambassadors, and federal judges must undergo a confirmation hearing, during which they are questioned by the Senate about their record, qualifications, and how they will perform their government duties. Confirmation in this process requires a simple majority voting to confirm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recess appointments work differently, and they don’t require a vote. The president simply appoints an official of their choice. The idea behind them was that there might arise times when the president needed to appoint someone to keep the government functioning, while Congress was out of session (in recess).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“At the time the Constitution was written, Congress met mainly nine out of 24 months, and there were long stretches where Congress wasn&#8217;t in session,” Squire told Vox. As such, the Constitution states the president has the “Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congressional recesses aren’t as long as they once were. Now, recesses happen in between each congressional session and around holidays. Recess appointments still work the same way, however. And as the text notes, any appointment made during a recess isn’t permanent: Presidential appointments made during a recess last to the end of that second session, meaning for a period of no more than two years. A president can renominate their pick after that, or reappoint them during another recess.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How have they been used in the past?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With the exception of Trump and President Joe Biden, recent presidents have made use of recess appointments; according to the <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R42329.pdf">Congressional Research Service</a>, former President Barack Obama made 32 recess appointments, Bill Clinton made 139 recess appointments, and George W. Bush made 171 recess appointments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though recess appointments were meant to be used in emergencies or in times when Congress met less often, over the past few decades, they’ve become seen as a way for presidents to get around congressional opposition. The process faced major scrutiny during the Obama administration, and was curtailed after a 2014 Supreme Court ruling that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/jun/26/supreme-court-rules-against-obama-recess-appointments">Obama had overstepped his power</a> in utilizing recess nominations. (That’s why neither <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/11/11/senate-recess-appointments-trump-republicans/">Trump</a> nor Biden made any recess appointments.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an effort to block recess appointments, the chamber often employs what are known as “pro forma” sessions. These short meetings, in which no real business is conducted, mean the Senate is never in recess for more than 10 days —&nbsp;preventing the president from making any appointments without the body’s consent. A pro forma session can be as simple as one senator gavelling in, and then calling the session over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If recess appointments are reinstated, there is little Democrats could do to stop the process, Squire said. But they could slow down legislative processes, which “wouldn&#8217;t necessarily prevent [recess appointments] from happening, but there would be a penalty — a cost attached to it.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>[<strong>Editor’s note:</strong> On November 11, 2024, Richard Allen was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/us/delphi-murders-richard-allen-trial.html">convicted</a> of the 2017 deaths of Liberty German and Abigail William.]</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"> In my inbox sit three eerie, unsolicited photographs of a crime scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The photos, not graphic but disturbing all the same, were allegedly taken at the scene of the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/liberty-german">Delphi murders</a> — the double homicide of two best friends, Abigail Williams, 13, and Liberty German, 14, in rural Delphi, Indiana, in 2017. The whistleblower who sent them to me, as he calls himself, runs one (or several) of a slew of anonymous accounts who’ve recently been contacting reporters, YouTubers, and true crime podcasters in an effort to get someone to publish these allegedly exclusive photos. The assumption is that as a reporter who covers these stories, and an admitted true crime fan myself, I’d be interested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m not, but this is one of the things that happens when a murder, or murders, in America stops being a local tragedy and becomes “true crime.”</p>

<p>It’s extremely difficult to describe Delphi — “Delphi” here encompassing the murders, the town, the investigation, the online community of true crime enthusiasts following it, and all of their complex interactions with one another. It’s too vast and tragic to put into words, and also too messy and complicated. Of all the recent “big” cases, Delphi has developed an entire true crime ecosystem of communities — all wanting justice for two tragically murdered girls, and all too often at odds with each other in their pursuit of it.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see why it has gotten so big and complex. With both images and audio of the alleged killer made quickly available to the public, this was a case primed for virality — and all that goes with it.&nbsp;Six years, two separate witness sketches, a long chain of hotly debated suspects, multiple side investigations into different crimes, a massive online sideshow, and one strangely unsatisfying arrest later — of a local man who made himself known to police on the very first day — Delphi is still a troubling, disturbing mystery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As difficult as Delphi is to stare directly at, however, it’s worth making the attempt. Because as eerie and ugly as it is, this case is significant, not just for the complex ecosystem that has formed around it, but because, in all its messiness, it points the way toward the complicated future of true crime itself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“Down the hill”</h2>

<p>Carroll County, Indiana, where tiny Delphi, population 2,972, is located, is as rural as it gets. Near the northern edge of town lies the Monon High Bridge Trail, an easy walking path that runs southeast to the Monon High Bridge. An abandoned railroad trestle, it’s a massive, 853-foot-long structure, the second-tallest bridge in the state, and it has no railing: A slip and a fall,&nbsp;a tumble through one of the many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alR-YGWXPYs">missing railroad ties</a> on the bridge, and it’s a sheer drop of 63 feet to the creek below.</p>

<p>While the terrifying bridge is technically off-limits to the public, in reality it’s a cool hangout spot.</p>

<p>On February 13, 2017, a sunny Monday afternoon, best friends Abby Williams and Libby German asked German’s older sister to drop them off at the trail. <a href="https://people.com/crime/liberty-german-abby-williams-slain-indiana-teens-two-weeks-missing/">According to</a> German’s grandmother, German and her older sister frequently hung out at the bridge, hiking and taking photos, so it wasn’t a concern for big sis to drop the two girls off, shortly before 2 pm, and be on her way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>German’s father intended to pick them up in an hour or two, after he was done with his afternoon errands. As the girls were crossing the bridge, German turned back and posted several photos to Snapchat, including one of Williams minding her steps.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469044/libby_abby_bridge.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,35.274869109948,100,29.450261780105" alt="Woman walking on railroad tracks" title="Woman walking on railroad tracks" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="One of the last photos taken from Liberty German’s phone, posted to Snapchat. | Snapchat via Facebook" data-portal-copyright="Snapchat via Facebook" />
<p>The girls walked to the southeast end of the bridge, at which point the trail effectively ends, petering out into the undergrowth. German’s camera briefly captured footage of a burly man in a blue coat and jeans, walking along the bridge toward them. As German <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/local/police-delphi-murder-victims-spoke-of-man-behind-them-in-audio-played-for-family/531-4391eb86-9939-41c4-a921-501e7af81ca6">continued recording</a>, what started out as speculation turned to fear. As a 2022 arrest <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23321732-probable-cause-affidavit-filed">affidavit</a> eventually revealed, one of them, likely Williams, murmured, “Gun,” as the man approached.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Trapped between the man and the woods, with a steeply sloping hill on either side and no way back across the bridge, the girls were effectively cornered.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Guys,” he ordered them, “down the hill.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>A 2017 <a href="https://interactive.wthr.com/pdfs/logan-warrrant.pdf">search warrant</a>, revealed in 2022, confirmed the existence of a chilling 43-second video of almost total silence following these words, during which the girls were seemingly marched to their deaths. By the time German’s father <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2dc5pk04Yc">reportedly</a> called her at 3:11 pm to say he was on his way to pick them up, the girls had likely already been abducted. The families quickly formed search parties; at 5:20 pm, German and Williams were officially reported missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Numerous people were on the High Bridge Trail that day. Several of them came forward that same afternoon, but none of them reported seeing what happened to Williams and German.</p>

<p>Around noon the next day, Valentine’s Day 2017, the girls were found lying about a half-mile from the bridge, across a stretch of private property by the creek. The widely accepted but as yet unconfirmed details of what happened to them are horrific and bizarre, with some authorities believing the bodies could have been “<a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/i-team-8/fbi-agent-bodies-moved-and-staged-in-delphi-murders-suspect-took-clothing/">moved and staged</a>.” This has prompted theories that the girls were placed in the creek after the initial searches on the 13th were called off for the evening.</p>

<p>But this is just one of the myriad speculations in a case that became a many-headed hydra of warring beliefs, agendas, and endless theories, with few answers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A frustrating conundrum: An abundance of leads, and no suspect in sight</h2>

<p>The Delphi murders should have been easy to solve. Law enforcement had a full, if blurry, video of the perpetrator, plus a recording of his voice. Surely, someone in such a small community would recognize him immediately. Right?</p>

<p>That’s not what happened.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using the footage German captured of the abduction in-progress, police quickly <a href="http://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/help-isp-identify-this-man-who-was-on-the-walking-trails-monday-near-delphi?_ga=2.34667681.1203828117.1676262820-1296537285.1676262820">released</a> the now-famous double photo of the man the internet has dubbed “Bridge Guy.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469048/libby_bg2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,24.473724229324,100,51.052551541353" alt="Two men walking on railroad tracks" title="Two men walking on railroad tracks" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Stills of footage of “Bridge Guy,” believed to be the suspect in the murders of Liberty German and Abigail Williams, taken from German’s phone on February 13, 2017. | Indiana State Police" data-portal-copyright="Indiana State Police" />
<p>Nine days after the murders, <a href="https://www.wrtv.com/news/crime/updates-expected-today-on-delphi-teen-killings">police released</a> an audio recording of Bridge Guy, now officially named a suspect, saying, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftnAPuBrwDM">Down the hill.</a>”&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was arguably the moment when Delphi stopped being solely a hometown tragedy and entered the annals of true crime fame — when the eerie disembodied audio, complete with the pixellated image of the killer, swept across media outlets nationwide, galvanizing interest in the tragic story of two young friends who died brutally, side by side. The day after the release of the recording, police had to divert tips in the case to a national call center run by the FBI’s Major Case Contact Center. By early March, the case had <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2017/03/09/evansdale-indiana-double-homicide-links-coincidental-indiana-state-police-say/98956208/">received</a> over 11,000 leads from across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I consider Delphi to be the first case that hit that land speed record in terms of [generating] interest in it at once,” defense attorney Bob Motta, who hosts the <a href="https://defensediaries.com/"><em>Defense Diaries</em></a> podcast, tells Vox. This is the rare case that law enforcement <em>wanted</em> to go viral. Police turned to the wider public in the hope of generating leads, and when public interest waned, they kept the case on the national media radar by doling out new tidbits of information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same time, the police seemed to clamp down hard when it came to providing vital context for the info they shared. Even six years later, there’s scant information on the official ISP <a href="https://www.in.gov/isp/crime-reporting/delphi-homicide-investigation/">tip page</a>. (A spokesperson for the Indiana State Police was unable to comment on the investigation due to a recent court gag order.) The little information the police did reveal was often confusing, baffling, even contradictory. This limbo left the public with no real guidelines for how to be helpful — which may have rendered them anything but.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The first police sketch, and the chaos it awakened</h2>

<p>On July 17, 2017, authorities <a href="https://www.jconline.com/story/news/crime/2017/07/17/new-details-released-delphi-double-homicide-investigation/483717001/">released a sketch</a> of a suspect based on an eyewitness sighting. ISP Sgt. Kim Riley informed the public at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_oZ51DmANo">press conference</a> that authorities believed this to be “the same person” captured in the stills from German’s video, a.k.a. Bridge Guy.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469098/delphi_bg1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,30.470976223224,100,39.058047553553" alt="Police sketch of “Bridge Guy”" title="Police sketch of “Bridge Guy”" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The first released sketch of a man believed to be “Bridge Guy.” | Indiana State Police" data-portal-copyright="Indiana State Police" />
<p>This sketch opened the floodgates for online guesswork. Just two days after the sketch’s release, ISP was <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/news/nation-world/isp-to-facebook-users-stop-armchair-sleuthing-on-delphi-murders/507-457927682">cautioning</a> “armchair sleuths” to stop posting side-by-side images of the suspect sketch and random men on social media. Online, suspicion was often aimed at the victims’ family members as well as unaffiliated Delphi residents and men across the US — anyone and everyone who bore a passing resemblance to the sketch. Two Delphi residents who have the same name both experienced intense harassment after multiple true crime podcasts hinted at the involvement of one of them, again based on nothing more than speculation.</p>

<p>Multiple people I spoke with lamented the current state of online sleuthing around the case, but blamed the pointed but incomplete information coming from law enforcement for leading to the anarchy online. “I don’t think of myself as having been drawn to the online community in this case so much as having been ‘pushed’ to the online community due to law enforcement being so tight-lipped,” Robby Coleman, a 36-year-old Indianapolis websleuth, tells Vox. “This was the only avenue for learning <em>anything</em> for years.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The second sketch, and a trail going cold</h2>

<p>Despite this frenzy of interest in the case, for the next two years, there were no significant developments. Then, on April 22, 2019, authorities unveiled an onslaught of information. Among the reveals was an amended <a href="https://www.heraldbulletin.com/news/newly-released-audio-in-delphi-murders/audio_3463bf8e-651f-11e9-8111-a3596f4bc66c.html">audio clip</a> of the killer, in which he could be heard saying one extra word; “Guys, down the hill,” and a two-second video clip of the image they’d previously provided stills of. Both clips raised more questions than answers.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube alignnone"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seWioxRdQ5k
</div></figure>

<p>The most puzzling reveal was a new suspect sketch, reportedly drawn early in 2017. Authorities presented it as a replacement for the old sketch, eventually <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/crime/2019/04/24/2-sketches-delphi-murders-case-not-same-man-indiana-state-police-say/3564467002/">clarifying</a> that this was an entirely new suspect — a man in his mid-20s to 30s, where “Bridge Guy” appeared to be 40-50. Indiana State Police Superintendent Doug Carter described the investigation as “shift[ing] gears to a different investigative strategy,” without specifying what that strategy was.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469099/delpthi_ybg.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,28.184991273997,100,43.630017452007" alt="Police sketch of “Bridge Guy”" title="Police sketch of “Bridge Guy”" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="The second released sketch of a man believed to be “Bridge Guy.” | Indiana State Police" data-portal-copyright="Indiana State Police" />
<p>After two years, was the case back to square one?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any hope that this about-face would lead to renewed momentum quickly faded: Another two years passed before there was a significant update in the case — or at least one that seemed significant at the time.</p>

<p>In December 2021, authorities arrested a man named <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/crime-watch-8/man-behind-anthony_shots-account-charged-for-child-porn-docs-dont-tie-him-to-delphi-case/">Kegan Kline</a>, a 27-year-old resident of nearby Peru, Indiana, who had been linked to an <a href="https://www.wrtv.com/news/public-safety/detectives-looking-for-information-related-to-social-media-account-in-connection-to-abby-and-libby-investigation">online catfishing account</a>. Although authorities have never named Kline as a person of interest in the Delphi investigation, they made it clear they believed there was a connection. Kline was subsequently prosecuted for <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/indiana-news/judge-dismisses-five-child-pornography-charges-against-kegan-kline/">25 charges</a> related to possession of child sexual abuse material and child exploitation; his trial is currently scheduled for May 2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In early February 2022, the ISP’s Carter <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/police-speak-directly-unknown-delphi-killer-today-day/story?id=82375198">did an interview</a> with ABC in which he stated — in what was certainly news to those following the case — that police “know a lot” about the killer, without saying anything about what, or who, that might mean.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A cold trail gets hot online</h2>

<p>Following Carter’s interview, ambivalence from law enforcement again enabled the websleuths to fill in the gaps with chaos. On numerous <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DelphiMurders/">subreddits</a> and other forums, hordes of “leakers” tout exclusive insider intel and spout arcane theories built around regional gossip and local politics: law enforcement cover-ups, drug ring conspiracies, sheriffs with tunnel vision, former prosecutors with vendettas, officers maligned for doing their jobs too well, an investigation driven more by the vicissitudes of local elections rather than a pursuit of justice — every “murder in a small town” trope you can foist onto one crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To even be able to read most of the Delphi forums, you have to learn a glossary of acronyms and shorthand lingo — BG (Bridge Guy), FSG (Flannel Shirt Guy, one of the witnesses seen on the bridge), OBG (Old Bridge Guy), YBG (Young Bridge Guy), LE (law enforcement), MBW (“Muddy and Bloody” Woman — we’ll get to her), and an endless parade of other people referred to only by their initials. Anyone who surmounts that barrier to entry is already more likely to be invested in the case — and more likely to find themselves joining in the rampant, furious finger-pointing that accompanies it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most polarizing constituents is <a href="https://murdersheetpodcast.com/"><em>The Murder Sheet</em></a>, a podcast by a husband-and-wife team who originally met and bonded over true crime. Áine Cain, a former senior retail reporter at Insider, and Kevin Greenlee, an attorney, wanted to bring their professional roles to the podcast. In an interview, Cain says the show focuses on journalism that “furthers your understanding of the case.” They’ve arguably been successful; they’ve gotten several exclusives, like excavating the 2017 <a href="https://interactive.wthr.com/pdfs/logan-warrrant.pdf">search warrant</a> of the property where the girls were found. (Suspicions against the property owner, Ronald Logan, have lingered and continue to run rampant; Logan was never named a person of interest and <a href="https://heavy.com/news/ronald-ron-logan-delphi-murders/">reportedly</a> died in 2022.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Online, however, despite Cain’s long journalism career, and perhaps because they began as true crime fans, some sleuths <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueCrimePodcasts/comments/wwhjeb/is_murder_sheet_worth_it/">see them</a> as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LibbyandAbby/comments/xzed3h/murder_sheet_discussion_thread/#irn6wrn">little more</a> than glorified redditors.&nbsp;Then there’s the issue of money. The podcast is self-sustaining (“just barely”), and Cain and Greenlee have recently gone full-time. That move, in turn, invites <a href="https://twitter.com/libertyg_sister/status/1526283798190645250">criticism</a> that the podcasters are exploiting tragedy for personal gain.&nbsp;Yet <em>The Murder Sheet</em> is far from the only monetized true crime project focused on this case. One <a href="https://beyondhighbrow.com/delphi/">forum</a> advertises a secretive community with exclusive access to private information from law enforcement ($20 to join; the owner told Vox he<strong> </strong>has made over $5,000 from the entry fees alone). The <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2022/10/31/the-big-business-of-true-crime/">massive growth</a> of the true crime industry means more people than ever are engaging in the space — and not always ethically. One popular podcast courted controversy when it aired a series of episodes in which the hosts put forth speculation about a random Delphi resident with no known connection to the crime.</p>

<p><em>The Murder Sheet</em>’s biggest find arguably came in 2022: <a href="https://www.wishtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Tx-statement-Kegan-Kline-10-19-2-FINAL-VERSION-Redacted-1.pdf">a transcript</a> of a police interview with Kegan Kline. The interview contained a wealth of new information. Yet the pair came under fire from other <a href="https://www.thefalllinepodcast.com/episodes/2022/5/25/true-crime-revolution-sarah-turney-part-2">podcasters</a> and onlookers for leaking info and reportedly initially leaving in an unredacted identifying detail. The transcript, however, provided the first substantiated link between Kline and the murders. Kline admitted in it to having previously interacted with Libby German.</p>

<p>This flurry of online activity stood in stark contrast to the radio silence from law enforcement. By 2022, even the victims’ families were voicing their frustrations. “They don’t know what they’re doing,” German’s mother <a href="https://www.953mnc.com/2022/05/27/delphi-victims-mom-growing-weary-frustrated-with-lack-of-case-progress/">told reporters</a> in May.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In October of that year, however, the state of the case abruptly changed — with a surprising, confounding arrest.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A sudden arrest and a whole new set of questions</h2>

<p>On October 26, 2022, <a href="https://www.wrtv.com/news/delphi/arrest-made-in-delphi-murder-investigation-sources-say">authorities arrested</a> a Delphi resident: <a href="https://www.wrtv.com/news/delphi/who-is-richard-allen-suspect-in-murders-of-libby-abby-is-pharmacy-tech-and-longtime-delphi-community-member">Richard Allen</a>, a 50-year-old CVS pharmacy employee with no criminal record.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few days later, authorities confirmed the arrest in a frustratingly brief press conference. It took another month for the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23321732-probable-cause-affidavit-filed">arrest affidavit</a> to be unsealed, revealing the stunning truth behind the arrest: Allen had actually gone to police in 2017, shortly after the murders, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wishtv.com/news/crime-watch-8/source-investigators-have-known-for-years-that-the-delphi-suspect-was-on-the-monon-high-bridge-the-day-abby-and-libby-were-killed/">identified himself</a>&nbsp;as having been on the bridge on February 13.</p>

<p>Why had it taken so long to find him? Media reports <a href="https://www.wane.com/news/clerical-error-may-have-led-police-to-overlook-richard-allen-in-delphi-case-source-claims/">blamed the snafu on the FBI</a>, hinting that a filing error by “a civilian FBI employee” led to the delay. Was it really that simple? Did the investigation spin its wheels for five years for no reason at all?</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469109/delphi_allen.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.5551427123797,100,92.889714575241" alt="Richard Allen mug shot" title="Richard Allen mug shot" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A mug shot of Richard Allen, charged in the Delphi murders. | Indiana State Police" data-portal-copyright="Indiana State Police" />
<p>The most overwhelming evidence for Allen’s guilt is that he placed himself on the bridge and he looks like Bridge Guy. According to the affidavit, Allen’s self-identified outfit of a blue jacket and jeans matched that of the suspect. This could, on the one hand, be highly damning circumstantial evidence; if he didn’t realize Libby German had caught him on camera, he’d think nothing of placing himself on the bridge. Then again, he was arguably wearing one of the most generic outfits in Indiana: a blue Carhartt jacket and jeans.</p>

<p>The multiple eyewitness sightings of Bridge Guy are consistent with Allen. One woman claimed to have seen a man who fits Allen’s description looking “muddy and bloody.”&nbsp;Then there are the ballistics. According to the affidavit, an unspent shell casing was found lying between the bodies of the victims — a casing investigators were able to match to Allen’s gun. There’s no mention in the affidavit of DNA, so this could be the best forensic evidence the state presents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are several problems with this, however. For starters, the entire field of ballistics evidence is increasingly considered to be <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-field-of-firearms-forensics-is-flawed/">subjective pseudoscience</a> rather than legitimate forensics. And even among already-shaky ballistics, matching an individual gun cartridge to an unspent casing is an extremely rare type of evidence. In <a href="https://art19.com/shows/murder-sheet/episodes/39ba2b53-ce09-4a22-a2ff-e5715ee768ad">an interview</a> with <em>The</em> <em>Murder Sheet</em>, one anonymous criminal defense attorney said he’d never seen an unspent shell casing presented as evidence in a trial.</p>

<p>The probable cause affidavit has divided followers of the murders into camps; Allen’s defense released a strongly worded <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/crime/delphi-girls-murdered/delphi-murders-hearing-richard-allen-defense-attorneys-speak/531-612e9590-ace8-4b93-8f7c-a674228d71c6">rebuttal</a> to it, pointing out the many gaps in the investigation. Meanwhile, the case is under a <a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/news/crime/delphi-girls-murdered/special-judge-decision-public-court-documents-released-delphi-indiana-murders-abby-williams-libby-german-richard-allen/531-2e2a1a98-8d49-4a0c-88e8-9623ad7e6193">gag order</a>, which means no more information will be forthcoming until trial. The first hearing was recently <a href="https://www.wrtv.com/news/delphi/delphi-murders-trial-hearing-scheduled-for-friday-is-postponed">delayed</a> because the prosecution had yet to <a href="https://www.wane.com/news/indiana/defense-asks-for-delay-in-feb-17-bail-hearing-for-delphi-murder-suspect-richard-allen/">turn over</a> all of its evidence to the defense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Allen is Bridge Guy, then his role in the crime raises numerous questions. Was he acting alone or — as prosecutors have <a href="https://people.com/crime/accused-delphi-killer-not-only-actor-involved-prosecutor/">claimed</a> — with others? Is Kegan Kline still somehow connected to the murders? If Ronald Logan was the original hot choice for Bridge Guy, as indicated in the search warrant for his property, why didn’t law enforcement pursue him as a person of interest more diligently?&nbsp;And why did Allen continue living in Delphi, even keeping his clothes from the day of the homicides, as though nothing had happened?</p>

<p>If there’s little forensic evidence tying Allen to the crime, then the abundance of alternate suspects could present a gold mine for his defense. Meanwhile, websleuths continue pursuing their own agendas — to the point that, even if Allen is found guilty, there will likely be plenty who reject the verdict. “You need to accept that Ron Logan is Bridge Guy,” the whistleblower tells me. When asked about the lack of evidence, he retorts, “I don’t care about evidence, there’s no such thing as evidence.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has a point: If there’s anything true crime teaches us, it’s that facts, circumstances, evidence, proof, doubt, and truth are all often in the eye of the beholder. “There’s a million Scott Petersons out there,” <em>Defense Diaries’</em> Motta says, referring to the convicted family annihilator whose guilt has lately been a <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23506125/casey-anthony-evidence-where-the-truth-lies-how-true-or-false">trendy topic</a> of debate. “If people start digging they’re going to find warts on every single case.” He feels there likely will be no narrative resolution. “It’ll always be left for us to wonder.”</p>

<p>And yet, ironically, as C.J. Hoyt, news director of the Indianapolis news stations Fox59 and CBS4, points out, if Allen is guilty, it won’t be in any way because of the years of obsessive work by armchair detectives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I think any exposure can be good,” he said, “but there are elements that can clearly be harmful, especially to the victims’ families. An example of that would be the person trying to sell crime scene photos. But like most cases, the online community didn’t factor in at all when it came to solving it — if Allen is, in fact, the killer.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24469113/libby_abby_via_fb.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.708427060106,100,78.583145879787" alt="Two young girls, their faces blurry in the dark, wear light-up glow stick glasses as the sun sets behind them." title="Two young girls, their faces blurry in the dark, wear light-up glow stick glasses as the sun sets behind them." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Liberty German, left, and Abby Williams. | Facebook" data-portal-copyright="Facebook" />
<p>And that might be the biggest irony of all — because however obstructing, counterproductive, or messy their efforts are, every websleuth I spoke to says they do it not because of the game, the thrill of the chase, or the clout, but because of Abby and Libby — the girls who had a sleepover the night before and awoke early that morning, excited about having a day off school. They helped Libby’s grandmother with filing papers in exchange for pocket money; they wanted to go shopping later that afternoon, after the bridge.</p>

<p>“Last year, I took my own kids to the bridge,” Coleman told me. “I didn’t tell them what happened. They thought it was just a neat hike. They noticed the teddy bears and the memorials and asked, but I kept it at arm’s length. But I needed that to keep perspective. To make it real. A lot of the people in these groups need their own moment like that.”</p>

<p>And even those furthest down the rabbit hole say they are doing it for the girls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I believe the girls are watching this,” the whistleblower tells me. “I believe the girls are helping.”</p>

<p>Still, the empathy only extends so far. When he talks about the mother of one of the victims, he’s derisive. “She’s blocked, we don’t care about her.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then he tosses in an aside: He wants me to know he knows who killed <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Natalie-Wood">Natalie Wood</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats have faced a bitterly disappointing defeat, and the debate is on about why that happened.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Amid the opportunistic finger-pointing and evidence-free assertions that Vice President Kamala Harris could have won if only she had done this or that, there is a genuine search for explanations about what happened. The answer Democrats find most persuasive could greatly influence the party’s direction as it tries to win again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This debate will clearly go on for some time, and disentangling causality is difficult. But one way to think about it is to break up the question.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How much of the defeat was about Harris’s weakness as a candidate or her campaign strategy? How much was about Donald Trump’s strengths? How much was about President Joe Biden’s record? How much was about the Democratic Party brand generally? And how much was due to larger structural factors like a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893">global anti-incumbent trend</a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s possible that all of these played some role in the outcome, especially because issues like inflation can resonate across them all. But let’s go through them. </p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP9146325452" width="100%"></iframe>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-harris-an-unusually-weak-candidate">Was Harris an unusually weak candidate?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Any candidate who loses tends to get defined, in retrospect, as an obvious loser. So naturally, lots of the Democratic finger-pointing has been pointing at Harris. But how convincing is it?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris had some real strengths: her record as a former prosecutor, her formidable fundraising, and the fact that she was a fresh face. But many had grave doubts about her prospects <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362277/kamala-harris-donald-trump-polling">all along</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s political rise in deep-blue San Francisco, and later statewide in California, came by cultivating support among Democratic elites; she had never had to run in a swing state and therefore never developed a political style designed to appeal to swing voters. It was far from clear what those swing voters would make of her when she entered the 2024 race. (The one time before this year that she faced a decent Republican opponent — her first run for California attorney general, in 2010 — she barely won.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her campaign strategy was cautious and defensive. In her prior presidential campaign and during the vice presidency, she’d done several <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-presidenct-legacy.html">high-profile interviews</a> that went poorly, which spurred her to avoid such interviews. In this bid, she was happy to prosecute the case against Trump on the debate stage, but seemed much less comfortable when it was her being grilled. She often spoke in talking points and platitudes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was also her record. When Harris was trying to win the 2020 Democratic primary, she ran to the left, taking several policy positions (like <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/09/19/harris-fracking-reversal-may-have-a-sequel-00180080">banning fracking</a>) that did not seem politically tenable. Trump’s team used one clip from that campaign, when <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2024/10/harris-position-on-health-care-for-transgender-prisoners-and-detainees/">she touted</a> how she’d worked to ensure transgender inmates in California could access gender-affirming care, in a heavily funded attack ad. It <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html">concluded with the line</a>: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her campaign strategy hinged on trying to tack to the center, disavowing or simply avoiding her past positions, sending out signals to the business community that she’d be friendlier to them, while using former Rep. Liz Cheney as a Republican validator. She did not break with the Biden administration or the mainstream Democratic consensus on any issue of significance. She did not run as a bold populist or progressive, either.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, there’s gender and race. Many have wondered whether the voter backlash against her was due to sexism — particularly due to preliminary numbers suggesting the swing against her was most intense among men. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/us/politics/trump-win-election-harris.html">New York Times reports</a> that the Trump team’s ads often showed Harris “laughing or dancing in a colorful blouse and pink pants,” because Trump’s goal was “to make her look like a lightweight.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But is Harris getting too much of the blame? Evidence suggests the guy she replaced at the top of the ticket, Joe Biden, would have done much worse. One <a href="https://x.com/YouGovAmerica/status/1854895311644172605">post-election poll</a> found Trump would have beaten him by 7 percentage points nationally. Perhaps she did a decent job of playing a bad hand: the Biden administration’s record.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-it-biden-s-fault">Was it Biden’s fault?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s initial attempt to run for reelection — before it was curtailed by his disastrous debate — limited the time and options available to Harris. But the bigger problem may have simply been that she was his vice president, and his administration was very unpopular.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blueprint, a Democratic polling initiative, <a href="https://blueprint2024.com/polling/why-trump-reasons-11-8/">published research</a> showing that two of the three most effective arguments for pushing swing voters away from Harris were that “inflation was too high under the Biden-Harris administration” and that “too many immigrants illegally crossed the border under the Biden-Harris administration.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polling all year has shown that inflation and immigration were Democrats’ biggest vulnerabilities. So part of the party’s second-guessing will naturally involve whether Biden should have made different policy choices to produce different outcomes in those areas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden did not cause inflation, but his American Rescue Plan <a href="https://www.vox.com/23036340/biden-american-rescue-plan-inflation">did make it worse</a>, which resulted in higher prices and necessitated bigger interest rate hikes than would have happened otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His administration was also slow to adjust, and though a “soft landing” without a recession eventually resulted, voters hated the enduring high prices.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the border, too, Biden only belatedly pivoted. After a huge increase in the number of unauthorized immigrants arriving at the border in 2021 and onward, Democrats in blue states and cities struggled to deal with the logistics of so many arrivals, and public backlash brewed. Late in 2023, Biden tried to pass a border security bill through Congress, but failed — in part due to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/1/25/24050278/senate-immigration-border-ukraine-trump-mcconnell-romney">opposition from Donald Trump</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In mid-2024, the combination of a deal with Mexico and new executive orders seemed to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/border-crossings-dropped-lowest-level-biden-administration-september-rcna174574">finally cut down</a> on border crossings. But it’s possible Biden could have done more earlier, limiting the effectiveness of immigration as an attack on Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, Israel’s war in Gaza bitterly divided the Democratic coalition. There was probably no way to make everyone happy here, and polling <a href="https://blueprint2024.com/polling/why-trump-reasons-11-8/">does not show it</a> as a top reason swing voters turned against Harris. But the ugly controversy over Biden’s support for Israel (and Harris’s support for Biden’s policy) may have hurt her in Michigan and cut down on the left’s enthusiasm for her. It’s unlikely to have been decisive, but it certainly didn’t help.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-trump-an-unusually-strong-candidate">Was Trump an unusually strong candidate?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The political conventional wisdom has generally been that Trump is a weak candidate who’s been holding Republicans back — that his 2016 win was a fluke reliant on the Electoral College; that he was quite unpopular as president; that voters rejected him and his party in 2018, 2020, and (sort of) 2022; and that the GOP was taking a massive risk by nominating him again after he tried to steal the last presidential election and was indicted four times.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump may have been unusually well-positioned to take advantage of dissatisfaction with the Biden administration’s record on the economy and immigration.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump’s persona as a celebrity businessman, one who many voters view as especially savvy about the economy, has been an advantage for him in polls <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-schiller-trump-victory-economy-20161109-story.html">since his first campaign</a>. That wasn’t enough to save him amid the chaos of 2020, but given what’s ensued since, many Americans have looked back on Trump’s governing record more fondly. Voters have given him retrospective credit for the strong economy and low inflation environment of 2017 through 2019, while not really blaming him for the pandemic. Focus groups again and again <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/03/opinion/election-focus-groups.html">came back to the idea</a> that voters hated the Biden economy and thought Trump could fix it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/383197/kamala-harris-results-underperformed-democratic-senate-candidates">Trump’s outperformance of many down-ballot Republican candidates</a> in key races — in part due to split-ticket voting, in part due to Trump voters simply not voting down-ballot — suggests there was a significant bloc of “I don’t like Republicans much, but the economy was better under Trump” voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On immigration, too, there was a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/351535/3-theories-for-americas-anti-immigrant-shift">stunning swing</a> of public opinion to the right during Biden’s term, as border arrivals soared, which may have played to Trump’s advantage.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-this-a-backlash-against-the-democratic-party-for-going-too-far-left">Was this a backlash against the Democratic Party for going too far left?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One theory floating around is that the results show the public is punishing the Democratic Party for having moved too far left.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Josh Barro made this argument in <a href="https://www.joshbarro.com/p/trump-didnt-deserve-to-win-but-we">a Substack post</a>, citing poor Democratic governance in blue states and cities as well as “woke” far-left policies on crime, schooling, and trans rights as likely causes of public frustration. Perhaps this explains some of the disproportionate shifts against Harris we saw in deep-blue states like New York, as well as progressive prosecutors losing and a tough-on-crime ballot proposition <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2024-11-06/tide-shifts-against-criminal-justice-reform-among-california-voters">passing in California</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A counterpoint to this is that Democrats’ swing-state Senate candidates did well — several of them won despite Harris losing their states — and that even amid the backlash in New York, Democrats <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/06/nyregion/democrats-house-ny.html">flipped several House seats</a> in New York. That could be read to suggest the problem had less to do with the Democratic Party and more to do with the top of the ticket.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Democrats did likely lose the national popular vote as well as the presidency, so it’s hard to argue that the party’s political positioning is optimal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And demographic trends could be read as quite ominous for the party. As my colleague Eric Levitz recently wrote, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/383565/2024-election-results-kamala-harris-loss-democrats-future">Democrats lost serious ground</a> with both working-class voters and nonwhite voters. If those trends continue, the party will be in deep trouble, as there simply aren’t enough college-educated white voters in the electorate to get anywhere near a majority. So some are arguing that the party has simply become too dominated by the concerns of upscale white college graduates — and that they desperately need to change that.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="was-it-just-due-to-a-global-trend">Was it just due to a global trend?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, another school of thought holds that perhaps the explanation for the outcome doesn’t lie in the United States at all. Perhaps it’s just the latest example of a worldwide trend of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893">incumbents doing poorly</a> in democracies holding elections in the post-pandemic years. Inflation, as a worldwide trend caused by supply-side disruptions and foreign crises, is a big part of the reason for that global struggle.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Every governing party facing election in a developed country this year lost vote share, the first time this has ever happened,” John Burn-Murdoch <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e8ac09ea-c300-4249-af7d-109003afb893">reported for the Financial Times</a>. “It’s possible there is just no set of policies or personas that can overcome the current global anti-incumbent wave.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it is worth keeping in mind that Trump won quite narrowly, by just 2 percentage points or less in the decisive swing states. On the one hand, that could suggest Democrats did a surprisingly good job among structural headwinds, starting from behind and closing the gap as much as possible — even if it wasn’t ultimately enough.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, it could suggest that more could have been done. Was it really fated that there was absolutely nothing Democrats could have done over the past four years to improve their margin by 2 more points, however strong the headwinds?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whatever the answer, Democrats have two years until their next chance to take back a branch of the federal government — and plenty to figure out in the meantime.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last week, 43 monkeys, all of them young female rhesus macaques, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/science/escaped-monkeys-south-carolina.html">escaped</a> from the Alpha Genesis research laboratory in Yemassee, South Carolina, when an employee failed to properly secure the door to their enclosure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t the first time something like this happened at <a href="https://www.alphagenesisinc.com/">Alpha Genesis</a>, a company that breeds and uses thousands of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23795087/animal-experiments-primates-mental-health-effective">monkeys for biomedical testing</a> and supplies nonhuman primate products and bio-research services to researchers worldwide. In 2018, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) <a href="https://apnews.com/article/monkeys-escape-alpha-genesis-south-carolina-640eb78119c66b88a418ccd1e361318e">fined</a> the facility $12,600 in part for other incidents in which monkeys had escaped. “We’re not strangers to seeing monkeys randomly,” a nearby resident and member of the Yemassee town council <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/07/science/escaped-monkeys-south-carolina.html">told</a> the New York Times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alpha Genesis is now working to recapture the macaques, who are each about the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolina-escaped-monkeys-latest/">size of a cat</a>; over the weekend, 25 of them were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/10/us/monkey-captured-south-carolina.html">recovered</a>. Meanwhile, the animal protection group <a href="https://saenonline.org/media2/news-20241108.html">Stop Animal Exploitation Now</a>, which for <a href="https://saenonline.org/res-fr-sc-ag.html">years has filed</a> federal complaints against the facility, has <a href="https://www.foxcarolina.com/2024/11/08/animal-welfare-group-files-federal-complaint-against-facility-that-lost-43-monkeys-sc/">called</a> on the USDA to prosecute Alpha Genesis as a repeat violator of its duty to keep the animals secure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The recovery process is slow, but the team is committed to taking as much time as necessary to safely recover all remaining animals,” a Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TownYemasseeSC/posts/pfbid02WgwH7Fo78UbfJa2rn4eDiVDfdjFU5Dxq1PaPnspDPgFqesKefkDtxFbsDu8nLoTvl" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.facebook.com/TownYemasseeSC/posts/pfbid02WgwH7Fo78UbfJa2rn4eDiVDfdjFU5Dxq1PaPnspDPgFqesKefkDtxFbsDu8nLoTvl">post</a> from the Yemassee Police Department said, attributing the comment to Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In one way, this is a story about what looks like a corporate failure. But there is another way to understand this situation, both legally and morally. What if these intrepid macaques, who the lab has said pose no threat to the public and carry no infectious diseases, have a legal claim to freedom?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The legal status of wild animals is more contested and malleable than ever, evident in the recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/6/21/23173019/happy-elephant-bronx-zoo-new-york-lamda-artificial-intelligence-ai-google">court case</a> arguing that Happy, an elephant living at the Bronx Zoo, was a legal person entitled to freedom, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364284/peta-protests-animal-rights-factory-farming-effective">phasing out</a> of animal use at entertainment venues like circuses, and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24055003/long-tailed-macaques-biomedical-testing-ozempic-covid-endangered-species-act-cambodia">end</a> of US lab experimentation on chimpanzees. While Alpha Genesis may have a strong financial incentive to recapture the escaped monkeys, longstanding legal doctrines suggest that the 18 monkeys still at large may not belong to the company as long as they remain free and outside of its custody.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">State officials, or perhaps even members of the public, might even be legally protected in rescuing these monkeys from a fate of cage confinement and invasive experimentation and bringing them to a sanctuary. Such an outcome would matter not just for these monkeys but also for the rights of captive animals more broadly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>When a captive animal becomes free</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For many people, the idea of a lost animal becoming the property of another person might seem absurd. Certainly, no one would imagine forfeiting the companionship of a beloved dog or cat because the animal got out of the yard and was found by someone else. Neither law nor morality treats the escape of a domesticated animal as tantamount to a forfeiture of all claims to the animal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when it comes to wild animals, the law is different.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When a captive wild animal escapes, their captor generally remains liable for any damage the escaped animal creates to persons or property, but they may lose ownership of the animal, especially if the creature integrates into an existing wild population (sometimes called “reverting to the common stock”). That might sound unlikely for rhesus macaques in the US — the species is <a href="https://neprimateconservancy.org/rhesus-macaque/">native to South and Southeast Asia</a> and has been exported around the world for lab testing. But it turns out that it’s perfectly possible to live as a free-roaming rhesus macaque in South Carolina, where a more than four-decade-old population of the monkeys resides on the state’s Morgan Island, <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/trip-ideas/island-vacations/morgan-island-south-carolina-monkeys">also known as “Monkey Island.”</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Originally relocated from Puerto Rico between 1979 and 1980, the Morgan Island macaques now <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/morgan-island">serve</a> as a kind of reservoir of lab monkeys for the US government. Last year, Alpha Genesis <a href="https://www.postandcourier.com/news/alpha-genesis-takes-over-management-of-south-carolinas-monkey-island/article_fb08a7d2-ce5a-11ed-bd91-8b72f090aac4.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawGZbOlleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHYFCnOM0YaH8R9NKM1GPESXxRu2_0yPiEOUsZpelHpzWpsXMFnJkDLJ7hg_aem_wVg-y1EC5pzq9QdpOLgs2w">won a federal contract</a> to oversee the monkey colony there — in fact, the 43 escaped macaques had originally lived as “free-range” monkeys on the island before they were taken to be used for testing and research purposes, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/south-carolina-escaped-monkeys-what-we-know/">told</a> CBS News in a statement. While these monkeys may not be able to rejoin the Morgan Island colony on their own, the fact that they came from a wild population strengthens the view of them as animals who not only can live in the wild but who deserve to be free.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our modern understanding of animals’ legal status derives from 19th-century American common law cases, which adopted the classical Roman legal approach to wild animals, or <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ferae_naturae">ferae naturae</a>. Under that system, wild animals were a special type of property known as “fugitive” property because they could move freely and weren’t owned by anyone before being captured by a human. This created unique legal challenges — for example, conflicts between two hunters claiming the same animal — that can help us understand the case of the escaped monkeys.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 1805 New York Supreme Court case <a href="https://www.nycourts.gov/REPORTER/archives/pierson_post.htm"><em>Pierson v. Post</em></a>, sometimes considered the most famous property case in American law (and about which one of us has written <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/ca/universitypress/subjects/law/property-law/pierson-v-post-hunt-fox-law-and-professionalization-american-legal-culture?format=PB">a book</a>), is the starting point for understanding who legally owns a wild animal. In a dispute between two hunters, one who had been in hot pursuit of a fox and one who swooped in to kill the animal, the case held that the property interest of the latter was stronger. The court made clear that a definitive capture, and not pursuit alone, was necessary to establish and retain ownership of a wild animal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1898, another New York case, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/mullett-v-bradley"><em>Mullett v. Bradley</em></a>,<em> </em>went further by recognizing that capture alone is not sufficient to claim ownership of a wild animal if the animal is able to escape and regain their liberty. The court found that a sea lion who had been brought by rail from the Pacific Ocean to the East Coast and later escaped from an enclosure in Long Island Sound was legally free until he was captured by a different person two weeks later. Cases like these gave rise to a doctrine that legal scholars now call “the law of capture,” which holds that if a captive wild animal escapes and control over them is lost, they no longer necessarily belong to the party who had previously captured them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This line of legal reasoning generally works to the detriment of animals, ensuring that each generation of law students learns that animals are ours to possess and use for our own ends. But in the case of the escaped South Carolina monkeys, the law of capture raises doubt about whether the lab retains ownership of the animals unless and until it recaptures them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A more recent Canadian case suggests that the law of capture may indeed offer a path to rescue for escaped animals like the South Carolina lab monkeys. In 2012, Darwin, a Japanese snow macaque, became a worldwide media sensation when he was <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/stylish-but-illegal-monkey-caught-at-ikea-156237185/">found roaming through an Ontario Ikea store</a> wearing a shearling coat and a diaper. While Darwin had been kept as a pet, a Canadian court <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ikea-monkey-mom-ordered-to-pay-83k-in-legal-costs-to-sanctuary-1.2501250">ruled</a> that he was a wild animal, and his owner lost her rights to him after he escaped from her car. Toronto Animal Services <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8650292/what-happened-to-darwin-ikea-monkey/">captured</a> Darwin inside the store and transferred him to a primate sanctuary, where he could live among other macaques.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, one could argue that the escaped lab monkeys in South Carolina are effectively domestic animals who belong to their owner. Alpha Genesis has put resources into housing and raising them, including managing the monkey population on Morgan Island. But unlike pets who have been domesticated over many generations to live safely among humans, these rhesus macaques retain their wild instincts — they’ve been described as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/11/8/more-than-40-monkeys-on-the-loose-in-us-town-after-escaping-lab">skittish</a>, and food is being used to lure them into traps.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the monkeys were to return on their own, like a house cat coming home after a day of adventure, the legal case for viewing them as domestic animals would be stronger because wild animals, once they stray, must have no animus revertendi, or intention to return. So long as these monkeys express their desire to remain free by evading capture, they should be considered wild animals. A 1917 Ontario court case, <em>Campbell v. Hedley</em>, involving a fox who had escaped a fur farm, established a similar principle, finding that the animal remained wild and thereby became free after fleeing the farm because they belonged to a species that “require[d] the exercise of art, force, or skill to keep them in subjection.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are, to be sure, cases in which common law courts have found losing control of an animal does not result in a loss of ownership. A 1927 Colorado case, <a href="https://casetext.com/case/stephens-v-albers"><em>Stephens v. Albers</em></a>, held that a semi-domesticated silver fox who escaped from a fur farm still remained the property of that owner. And questions about the ownership of wild animals are infinitely debatable, as any good student of <em>Pierson v. Post</em> will tell you.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While these past cases offer important insight into the treatment of wild animals under common law, none of them took place in South Carolina, so courts in that state could consider them for guidance but wouldn’t be required to follow them when deciding who owns the escaped Alpha Genesis monkeys (and nothing in this piece should be construed as legal advice).&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The moral </strong>meaning of animal escapes</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet the law of capture aside, the plight of these monkeys is also interesting to us as legal scholars because it highlights one of many disconnects between the law and our moral intuitions about animals who have escaped and who are seeking or being afforded sanctuary. As journalist Tove Danovich has <a href="https://longreads.com/2018/05/17/wild-at-heart/">written</a>, there is often great public sympathy and compassion for animals who escape painful confinement or slaughter at zoos, factory farms, or research labs — even among people who might otherwise tolerate the very systems that normalize those animals’ suffering. The public’s outrage when a single cow who <a href="https://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/cow-fatally-shot-in-pocatello-after-escaping-from-meat-processing-facility/article_1cca0746-868b-11ef-aecb-17af9aa8cfe2.html">escapes slaughter is gunned down</a> by authorities is palpable and crosses ideological lines.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is something enchanting and powerful, even romantic, about the idea of an animal escape, especially if it results in the animal’s rescue from confinement. Yet the law generally fails to recognize the moral tug that these escapes place on our collective conscience.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a recent high-profile <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/21/nyregion/missing-cows-animal-sanctuary-newfane-ny.html">case</a> in upstate New York, two cows wandered onto an animal sanctuary after escaping from a neighboring ranch. Unlike the South Carolina monkeys, these were straightforwardly domesticated animals, and the response from local law enforcement was harsh.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The sanctuary owner, Tracy Murphy, was arrested, shackled, and faced criminal liability for taking the cows in and refusing to immediately turn them over for slaughter (one of us, Justin, was defense counsel for Murphy, whose case was <a href="https://www.niagara-gazette.com/opinion/editorial-major-conflict-in-cow-theft-case-warrants-probe/article_9ec60e46-815b-11ef-b68c-5b7d1740db84.html">dismissed</a> last month after a two-year legal battle). Her aid to two escaped cows was widely vilified by her neighbors and by local law enforcement because our legal system continues to treat many animals as property without any recognized rights or interests of their own.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The law is unlikely to swiftly abandon the archaic notion of human ownership over nonhuman animals. But we believe the law does implicitly recognize a right to rescue escaped animals, at least those who are lucky enough to make it on their own steam. We hope that the case of the escaped South Carolina monkeys will inspire conversations about the right of at least some animals to liberate themselves from exploitation and harm at human hands. Escapes are rare, but when they happen against all odds, we might ask ourselves, on both legal and moral grounds, whether the animals have a claim to freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382696/donald-trump-wins-2024-election-results-democracy">President-elect Donald Trump</a> has won his second — and final — term in office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/18/trump-at-nra-convention-floats-a-three-term-presidency-00158786">Trump has joked about pursuing a third term</a> and has a penchant for promoting authoritarian ideas, <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/11/07/can-donald-trump-run-2028-presidential-election/76094187007/">he’s barred from running again</a> by the 22nd Amendment of the US Constitution. To run for a third term, he’d have to repeal that amendment, and that would be difficult. Undoing a constitutional amendment requires an overwhelming level of support from Congress and state legislatures, support he would be unable to obtain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked if there were legal loopholes or other ways for a president to get around the 22nd Amendment, Stanford University law professor Michael McConnell, a specialist in constitutional law, had a definitive answer. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“No. There are none. This will be his last run for president,” McConnell told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-the-22nd-amendment-says"><strong>What the 22nd Amendment says</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 22nd Amendment firmly limits <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-we-wound-up-with-the-constitutions-only-term-limits-amendment">presidents to two</a> successful runs and applies equally to those elected to consecutive terms and those, like Trump, who are elected to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-trump-run-again-2028/">nonconsecutive terms</a>. It states the following:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The amendment <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/how-the-22nd-amendment-came-into-existence">was ratified in 1951</a> and came after years of both parties calling for term limits for the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While President George Washington set a precedent for only holding two terms in office, President Franklin D. Roosevelt later <a href="https://www.history.com/news/fdr-four-term-president-22-amendment">became the first and only commander-in-chief</a> to serve additional terms. Roosevelt was ultimately elected to four terms in office, though he passed away during his last term in 1945.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Following Roosevelt’s tenure, there were growing calls to establish term limits for future presidents, leading to Congress’s approval of the 22nd Amendment and states’ subsequent ratification.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-it-s-so-hard-to-roll-back-the-22nd-amendment"><strong>Why it’s so hard to roll back the 22nd Amendment</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The thresholds for approving a constitutional amendment and for repealing it are exceedingly high.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two ways to go about rolling back an amendment. The first would require two-thirds of both the House — 290 members — and the Senate — 67 members — to agree to do so. Once they did so, three-fourths of all states — 38 — would then also have to agree.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These thresholds would be impossible for Trump to meet given Democratic opposition, and there would likely be some Republican outcry as well. While <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/382868/republican-senate-majority-ohio-west-virginia-trump">Republicans are poised to retake Senate control</a>, they’ll fall far short of the two-thirds majority required for such a vote. If the GOP attains control of the House, they’d similarly fall far short of the two-thirds majority needed there. Additionally, at least 17 states have voted for Vice President Kamala Harris, signaling that they’d be unlikely to support any such amendment. That’s more than the one-fourth of states Trump could afford to lose should he somehow succeed in getting the amendment overturned by Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A second means of repealing an amendment would require holding a Constitutional Convention, which two-thirds of states — 34 — would have to support. Any amendments proposed at such a convention would still need ratification from three-fourths of states — 38. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This option would face the same opposition from Democrat-leaning states as the first one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the amendment was first approved, there have been numerous proposals in <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/term-limits/">Congress raised to repeal it</a>, though they have all languished due to lack of support.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-amendment-is-crystal-clear"><strong>The amendment is crystal clear</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts say there aren’t really any realistic options for Trump to try to bypass the 22nd Amendment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Theoretically, <a href="https://cornerstonelaw.us/22nd-amendment-doesnt-say-think-says/">the 22nd Amendment doesn’t prevent a former president</a> who has already served two terms from becoming vice president in a subsequent term. As vice president, that person could then potentially ascend to the presidency if the president on the ticket stepped down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It could theoretically happen, but it isn&#8217;t going to happen,” says McConnell, who added that it’s a “silly thing to worry about.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Efforts to challenge the amendment in court are also moot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court does not have the basis to overturn the 22nd Amendment, according to legal experts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Per UCLA law professor Adam Winkler, any challenge to a constitutional amendment would likely rest on arguments that the procedure used to approve the amendment was faulty in some way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s “impossible” in this case, says Winkler, given how this amendment has been settled for more than seven decades.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Winkler notes the Supreme Court could try to interpret the 22nd Amendment to say that it only applies to presidents who have served consecutive terms, but even that would be a stretch based on its text. Any effort to declare the amendment unconstitutional by the Court would run into the problem of the amendment being part of the Constitution, notes McConnell. “By definition, the Constitution cannot be unconstitutional,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, as Georgetown law professor Abbe Smith explained when asked if Trump could vie for a third term, it’s pretty simple: “Short answer: There is no way.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As such, Trump’s recent run is set to be his final one.&nbsp;</p>

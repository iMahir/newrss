<p class="has-text-align-none">From <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/362300/kamala-harris-meme-brat-summer">Charli xcx memes</a> to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mxwlch03/video/7394583648571313424?q=kamala%20charli%20xcx&amp;t=1724087690722">fan-made</a> covers interpolating her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mindyrose7/video/7394876881708780842?q=america%20has%20a%20problem%20kamala&amp;t=1724087650306">famous “coconut tree” quote</a>, Kamala Harris’s last-minute presidential bid against Republican candidate Donald Trump has had a fascinating and outsized relationship with pop music. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Various progressive singers, like <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/kamala-harris-president-katy-perry-ariana-grande-jamie-lee-curtis-b2583697.html">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/olivia-rodrigo-kamala-harris-reproductive-rights-1236082554/">Olivia Rodrigo</a>, have pledged their support. Katy Perry <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/katy-perry-hopes-kamalas-run-for-president-can-save-womans-world">offered</a> one of her latest singles, “Woman’s World,” for the current vice president to use in her campaign, though Harris doesn’t seem to have taken her up on it. Meanwhile, Harris’s staff has found ways to use pop music to attract Gen Z voters, having <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/megan-thee-stallion-performs-mamushi-body-kamala-harris-atlanta-rally-1235743523/">Megan Thee Stallion</a> perform at an Atlanta rally and fully embracing brat memes. This onslaught of memes and coconut-themed “remixes” has almost overshadowed the most crucial music-related decision involved in Harris’s candidacy: her campaign song. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last month, it was <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/beyonce-kamala-harris-campaign-freedom-rcna163599">reported</a> that Beyoncé permitted the Harris (now Harris-Walz) campaign to use her song “Freedom” featuring Kendrick Lamar. Since then, the rousing gospel-tinged anthem from her 2016 album<em> Lemonade</em> has soundtracked Harris’s rally entrances and will inevitably be heard several times at this week’s Democratic National Convention. There’s even speculation that Beyoncé herself could make an appearance. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The modern campaign song has become its own character — and target of inspection — in election politics. Most of these songs have already achieved popularity outside of the campaign trail, so they need to be vital enough to re-energize constituents. They also have to be memorable and on message, embodying the values and promises of the candidate. But are they actually useful? What does it mean for a song to belong to a campaign?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Post-Trump, pop music is also something that Democrats have been able to leverage against the right — not just big hits themselves but endorsements from the artists who make them. Conversely, there’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicians_who_oppose_Donald_Trump%27s_use_of_their_music">Wikipedia page of musicians</a> who have opposed Trump’s use of their music on the campaign trail, in addition to opposing him as president. However, the results of the 2016 presidential election have made the public <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/election-celebrities-trump-clinton-endorsements-beyonce-springsteen-david-jackson-bowling-green/507383/">second-guess</a> the power of pop music in this sphere. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite this skepticism, Dana Gorzelany-Mostak, an associate professor of music at Georgia College, argues that music can be an effective medium for politicians. “While it might not drive people to the polls, music models ways of being in the world and connecting with others,” she says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-621629084.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.63457185461,100,76.730856290779" alt="Beyoncé onstage in a black suit with white polka dots, blonde hair flying." title="Beyoncé onstage in a black suit with white polka dots, blonde hair flying." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Beyoncé performing at a Get Out The Vote concert for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on November 4, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For a campaign like Harris’s that has mostly trafficked in <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366368/tim-walz-vibes-memes-vice-president">“good vibes”</a> and likability over discussions about policy — the vice president just unveiled her policy agenda — Harris’s campaign playlist provides an interesting window into what she represents and which populations she’s counting on for support. As Jonquilyn Hill wrote for Vox, Harris’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/367288/kamala-harris-beyonce-press-silence-campaign">proximity to Beyoncé</a> may even signal how she plans to conduct herself. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I spoke to Gorzelany-Mostak to get more insight into Harris’s musical selections and the overall function of campaign songs. Her book, <em><a href="https://press.umich.edu/Books/T/Tracks-on-the-Trail">Tracks on the Trail: Popular Music, Race, and the US Presidency</a></em>, published last year, charts notable campaign songs and how these musical moments are used to articulate race. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>When did presidential campaign songs really become a thing?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The election of 1840 was a watershed moment for the campaign song. The supporters of Whig candidate William Henry Harrison promoted singing as a campaign-worthy activity, and they published small booklets called “songsters” with pro-Harrison lyrics. These candidate-inspired lyrics were set to the popular tunes of the day. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What goes into picking a campaign song? Is the candidate even directly involved in this process?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It varies depending on the campaign. In 2008, Barack Obama’s staffers had the candidate’s music tastes in mind when selecting his playlist. There was continuity between the artists he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/25/barackobama.uselections2008">discussed in interviews</a> on the trail and his rally playlist, which included Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Stevie Wonder, and the Isley Brothers. Donald Trump is known to select his own soundtrack for campaign rallies, and when off the clock, he “spins” from his iPad at Mar-a-Lago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What is the function of a campaign song, and why do campaign songs matter?  </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Candidates use music to constitute their identity in sound, to sonically construct themselves in a way that appeals to the public as well as offers insight into their character and their beliefs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A campaign song is more than its lyrics. Candidates need to think about the myriad ways songs might signal messages in political contexts. This means taking into consideration the artist’s biography, the composition and character of the artist’s fan communities, the connotations attached to the song’s genre, and of course, the meanings a song has accrued through its presence in other media. While pundits may privilege the spoken word or images, sound and music can be just as powerful persuaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, campaign music preaches to the choir. I don’t think it converts people or drives them away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In </strong><strong><em>Tracks on the Trail</em></strong><strong>, you write about candidates articulating race through music. What do you think Kamala Harris is trying to convey by choosing songs, both formerly and currently, by high-profile Black women? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Black female artists form the backbone of Harris’s 2024 rally playlist — Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Lizzo, Megan Thee Stallion. Harris elevates a matrilineal paradigm of Black excellence that spans 60 years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a notable contrast to the classic-rock-dominated Republican National Convention last month, which featured a band of aging male rockers playing covers of the Eagles, Kenny Loggins, Grand Funk Railroad, Steely Dan, and the Doobie Brothers. Trump has questioned Harris’s leadership cred and her racial identity, so Harris uses her soundtrack to disrupt this narrative by leaning into the very identity that he critiques.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Harris’s previous campaign song, Mary J.Blige’s “Work That,” is a lot more light-hearted and fun, in tone and message, compared to Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” which is a more austere, urgent song. How do you think these songs reflect the differences in those campaigns or even the broader political climate? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Freedom” does convey a certain level of urgency. But more broadly, Harris’s playlist reminds voters that they can acknowledge the country’s painful history, commit to the serious work that needs to be done, but still sing, laugh, and dance along with her on the path to victory. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of Harris’s playlist is composed of dance music, from Diana Ross and The Brothers Johnson to Dua Lipa and Bruno Mars, not to mention the more recent sounds of Charli xcx. To folks on the right, disco might signal the dangers of hedonism. But a genre that finds its roots in the leisure culture of Latinx, Black, and gay communities, it also points to a rich history of resistance and hope — even though these sounds have long since been domesticated, as evidenced by their presence on your mother’s gym playlist. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is not surprising that some of the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mxwlch03/video/7394583648571313424?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">videos</a> of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xcx.archive/video/7394640702946250014?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">Harris</a> set to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jqsids/video/7394543209814248737?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">Charli xcx</a>’s music show the candidate laughing, dancing, or mid-gaffe — Trump himself has even <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2024/08/18/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-presidential-election-latest-news/">criticized Harris’s laughter</a>. By infusing her playlist with unfettered expressions of joy and pleasure that are Black, queer, and/or female-centered, Harris manages to wrest the reins away from the male-centric gerontocracy, if only on the dance floor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I find there’s a dissonance between the breezy, light-hearted tone of Harris’s campaign and the way it has been memed by Gen Z with the austerity of a song like “Freedom” — not to mention, “Freedom” is hardly one of Beyoncé’s most popular songs. Do you think this choice is a misstep? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite its more austere tone, I do think “Freedom” is a good fit for Harris. It brings together a lot of narratives that align with her campaign message and the presidential brand she is trying to cultivate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Freedom” adopts an almost prayerful tone in its adoption of gospel signifiers and its textual reference to the spiritual “Wade in the Water.” In the spiritual, water represents the possibility for escape in times of enslavement. In “Freedom,” water also comes in the form of “rain” and “tears.” This alludes to the aftermath of Beyoncé’s personal turmoil and the cultural trauma of New Orleans post-hurricane and of Black communities impacted by mass incarceration. The song also samples the voices of a mid-century prisoner and preacher, and Jay Z’s grandmother opening up about her own hardship in 2015. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In choosing “Freedom,” Harris is situating herself and the 2024 election in the lineage and the sound world of these transhistorical struggles, both personal and political.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It seems like Beyoncé&#8217;s co-sign is maybe more powerful than the song itself. </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyoncé herself is a symbol of feminine power, endurance, and vitality. Her music defies categorization. She writes her own rules and regularly reinvents herself. So it’s no surprise that Harris wants to align herself with such a narrative as she embarks on her own reinvention from prosecutor to district attorney, to attorney general, to senator, to vice president, to president of the United States. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rape and killing of a 31-year-old woman medical resident has touched off protests across India as the country grapples with inadequate protections for women and increasing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-what-to-know-80596fc7aa0880133f56ace5d77240b2">reports of gender-based violence</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The demonstrations began in Kolkata — the capital of the eastern Indian state of West Bengal — following the woman’s rape and killing, which took place on August 9 at a medical school. They’ve since spread to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-medics-refuse-end-protests-over-doctors-rape-murder-2024-08-19/">other states, as well as the country’s capital, New Delhi</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The death of the trainee is just the latest of several <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/7/india-supreme-court-to-monitor-investigations-into-manipur-sexual-violence?traffic_source=KeepReading">high-profile recent incidents of gender-based violence</a> in India, and it comes at a time when sexual violence appears to be on the rise: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-what-to-know-80596fc7aa0880133f56ace5d77240b2">According to the National Crime Records Bureau</a>, there was a 20 percent increase in reported rapes in 2022 compared to 2021. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Indian government implemented stricter laws against sexual- and gender-based violence, as well as some <a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/india-lacks-national-policy-strengthen-health-response-gender-based-violence">national strategies to address it</a>, following international outcry over the 2012 case of a young woman who was gang raped and killed on a bus. But as the current tragedy <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/7/india-supreme-court-to-monitor-investigations-into-manipur-sexual-violence?traffic_source=KeepReading">and other high-profile cases</a> suggest, those laws have not ended India’s systemic problems with gender-based violence, and now, many of the protesters say they’ve had enough.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As part of the protests, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-medics-refuse-end-protests-over-doctors-rape-murder-2024-08-19/">thousands of doctors</a> (by some estimates, <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/08/13/india/kolkata-doctor-strike-trainee-rape-murder-intl-hnk">hundreds of thousands of doctors</a>) have left their posts. On Saturday, doctors across the country — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-what-to-know-80596fc7aa0880133f56ace5d77240b2">led primarily by women</a> — held a 24-hour strike. Over the past few days, some physicians,  such as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-d3f23d145891ec3031617647a8cc0166">a group of doctors in New Delhi,</a> have attempted to set up limited free care as part of their demonstrations, and most have refused to see non-emergency patients. Government officials have demanded that the protesting doctors return to work as usual; they have refused until their demands are met.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political leaders have called for justice. In an address on August 15 — India’s independence day — Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, without mentioning the Kolkata rape and death, that everyone in the country must “seriously think about the kind of atrocities which are taking place against our mothers, sisters, daughters” and that “crime against women should be investigated more urgently.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of now, the investigation into the rape and death continues, as do renewed calls for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-d3f23d145891ec3031617647a8cc0166">India to strengthen legal protections</a> for medical professionals generally and women specifically.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What we know about the death and rape of a student doctor in India&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are still a number of unknowns about the woman at the heart of the protests, who, per Indian law, has not been publicly named. However, we do know she worked at Kolkata’s government-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. She reportedly fell asleep in a seminar room at the hospital, after a long shift as a trainee physician. The following morning, on August 9, her colleagues found her body.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An autopsy report showed signs of sexual violence. A <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-doctor-death-who-is-sanjay-roy-civic-volunteer-arrested-in-rg-kar-hospital-rape-murder-case/articleshow/112440685.cms">volunteer with the police</a>, identified as Sanjay Roy, has been arrested and charged with her murder. The woman’s parents <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/kolkata-doctors-rape-murder-colleagues-involved-in-crime-parents-tell-cbi/article68532505.ece">insist that more people were involved</a>. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-d3f23d145891ec3031617647a8cc0166">Federal officials have taken</a> over the investigation of the case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the inquiry continues, doctors are protesting for safer conditions at their hospitals, including a law that would remove bail for those accused of attacking doctors. They are also demanding a swift resolution to the case and have prompted an examination of larger systemic issues with Indian gender-based violence, including stigma around sexual assault in the country and mistrust of local police, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-what-to-know-80596fc7aa0880133f56ace5d77240b2">according to</a> the Associated Press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Religious and ethnic minorities have been subject to gender-based and sexual violence by the state. Perhaps one of the most shocking historical cases is the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41268906">mass rape perpetrated by the Indian military in Kashmir in 1991</a>. More recently, in Jammu, a part of Kashmir that is a site of government repression and popular uprising, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43722714">an 8-year-old girl</a> was kidnapped, held in a Hindu temple, tortured, raped, and murdered by a former government officer and police co-conspirators in 2017. Police said the crime was part of an effort <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/six-men-convicted-in-rape-of-8-year-old-girl-that-shocked-india/2019/06/10/cde7b17c-8b5f-11e9-b162-8f6f41ec3c04_story.html">to push the nomadic Muslim community to which the girl belonged out of the area</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Infamously, Modi’s government <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/9/why-did-indias-supreme-court-send-bilkis-banos-rapists-back-to-jail">overturned the sentences of 11 men convicted of raping a Muslim woman in the 2002 Gujarat riots</a>, though they were eventually sent back to jail. Modi was at the time chief minister of Gujarat, and around 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in the riots. And cases like the woman’s proliferate at the community level as well; in the wake of her case, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/dalit-nurse-raped-by-doctor-in-up-hospital-3-held/article68542561.ece">three doctors were accused of raping a nurse</a> in northern India. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s so much gender-based violence” in India, Ather Zia, an anthropology professor at Northern Colorado University, told Vox. She added that’s by no means exclusive to India, though. “That’s the entire world.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since launching her presidential bid, Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign and its supporters have been eager to frame this election as one of a prosecutor versus a felon. It was among the themes of the first night of the Democratic National Convention on Monday. “In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. This is the story of Donald Trump,” a deep-voiced narrator said in a video that blared to the audience at the United Center in Chicago. “We need a president who has spent her life prosecuting perpetrators like Donald Trump.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The video was a play on what has become a part of Harris’s stump speech, in which she burnishes her legacy as a prosecutor. “I took on perpetrators of all kinds,” she told a crowd in Philadelphia on August 6. “Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who scammed consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.” Others have made the contrast between the two candidates more explicit. “The script writes itself: the prosecutor against the convicted felon,” California Sen. Alex Padilla <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362619/kamala-harris-president-vision-political-ideology-2024-election" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362619/kamala-harris-president-vision-political-ideology-2024-election">told Vox last month</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The framing aims to create a stark split screen between Harris and Trump, showing how they both fall squarely on opposite ends of the law. But it’s not clear that this line of attack is effective, and there are real downsides to propagating the simplistic story of good versus evil in the context of prosecutors and felons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because it’s not always such a clear contrast. Prosecutors, for example, have a <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/why-holding-prosecutors-accountable-is-so-difficult/">history of bending the rules</a> to get a conviction, and thousands of people <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/magazine/magazine_article/a-matter-of-conviction/">have been sent to prisons</a> for crimes they did not commit. Which brings us to the term “felon,” a label that stigmatizes more than it describes —&nbsp;and does a real disservice to efforts to reform a broken justice system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s get something out of the way up front: Calling Trump a felon is not unfair to Trump personally. While there are millions of people who’ve been mistreated by the US justice system, Trump is not one of them. He has spent years, if not decades, skirting the law, yet he has still evaded any meaningful personal consequences for his misdeeds. Indeed, after the Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>Trump v. United States</em>, his status as above the law has the US judiciary’s seal of approval.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But for others —&nbsp;particularly those living on the margins of society —&nbsp;the label “felon” can be a mark of injustice. It reduces a full human, even one who’s rehabilitated, to one of their worst moments, and it further stigmatizes people with a felony conviction as inherently dangerous and undeserving of a second chance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Nearly 20 million American citizens have a felony conviction, and 1 in 3 people across our country have some sort of record. Labeling people as ‘felons’ or using the word as a badge of honor for political purposes is a slap in the face to the millions of impacted individuals and families,” Desmond Meade, president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, <a href="https://time.com/7001914/prosecutor-versus-felon-narrative-trump-harris-essay/">wrote in a Time op-ed</a> last month. “The truth is the label doesn’t harm Trump, as much as it harms the millions of other people living with felony convictions.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“Felon” doesn’t hurt Trump —&nbsp;but it can hurt millions of others</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When she ran for president in 2020, Harris tried to dub herself a “progressive prosecutor” — a <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/363859/kamala-harris-prosecutor-record-tough-crime">label that didn’t stick</a> because her record had some tough-on-crime bona fides that didn’t sit well with many progressive voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This time, however, Harris and her supporters don’t seem as shy about touting some of the tougher elements of her record as district attorney and attorney general. That’s why the “prosecutor versus felon” framing seems to be taking hold with little concern about how it might alienate some progressive voters or criminal justice reform advocates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem with the way a lot of people use the word “felon” — as some of Harris’s supporters are doing — is that it’s often used not just as a neutral descriptor but as an insult. And it’s an insult that leans on society’s existing prejudices about who “felons” are.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take this telling example from the Trump campaign. Despite representing a candidate convicted of 34 felonies, the campaign —&nbsp;in one of its opening attacks against Tim Walz — <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184621/donald-trump-kamala-harris-tim-walz-felon-voting">criticized the Democratic vice presidential nominee</a> for “embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump campaign is comfortable attacking “felons” despite Trump’s felony convictions precisely because of the tropes associated with the word “felon.” The campaign clearly knows that for many people, especially its supporters, the word isn’t associated with people like Trump —&nbsp;no matter how <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/reports/708/">common white-collar crime is</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When most Americans think about who is in the criminal legal system, they envision somebody who is Black, who is poor, who is somebody who is ‘not like us,’” said Insha Rahman, director of Vera Action, a criminal justice reform advocacy group. “There’s an othering there that is inherent in calling somebody a ‘felon.’ It doesn’t stick to Donald Trump because he doesn’t fit those characteristics that are in people’s minds, but the danger is that it will stick to others and reinforce that stigma the more it’s thrown around.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American politicians have long weaponized the stigma around the term felon to bar millions of people from voting through the years, even after serving their sentences. And felony disenfranchisement laws, many of which cropped up during Reconstruction, were specifically <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/racism-felony-disenfranchisement-intertwined-history">designed to undermine Black voter blocs</a>. That’s why campaigns to uphold felony disenfranchisement laws often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/opinion/the-racist-origins-of-felon-disenfranchisement.html">lean on racist tropes</a>, labeling people with felony convictions as inherently dangerous to society while disproportionately disenfranchising Black, brown, and poor people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When an average person is labeled a “felon,” the word carries a lot more weight throughout their life than it does for Trump. Once people leave prison, reentering society has many barriers, and the stigma that comes along with being seen only through a felony conviction makes it difficult to reintegrate into society. From voting rights to housing to employment and educational opportunities, people with felony convictions <a href="https://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/criminal-justice/Re-Entry-Fact-Sheet.pdf">face harsh discrimination</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last decade or so, many organizations have been pushing people to stop using the word “felon” to describe individuals because of the way it reduces a person’s identity to a single category. Media outlets have also been discouraged from using the term. Bill Keller, the founding editor-in-chief of the Marshall Project, for example, <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/04/27/the-other-f-word">wrote in 2016</a> that “Words that not long ago were used without qualms may come to be regarded as demeaning: ‘colored,’ ‘illegals.’ ‘Felon,’ which makes the person synonymous with the crime, is such a word.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>So how should Harris talk about Trump’s crimes?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the obstacles to boiling the election down to “prosecutor versus felon” is that Harris’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/363859/kamala-harris-prosecutor-record-tough-crime">own record as a prosecutor</a> underscores exactly why those labels aren’t so black and white. And while some voters may relish watching a prosecutor at work, others in her coalition — specifically progressive voters —&nbsp;are only reminded of her tough-on-crime bona fides that they’re not fans of. That’s particularly true of cases where she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html">pushed to uphold wrongful convictions</a> that had been won through prosecutorial misconduct. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I do think that [the prosecutor versus felon] framing glosses over a lot of the nuances of what prosecutors do,” said Wanda Bertram, a communications strategist at the Prison Policy Initiative. And it’s coming at “a time when we have really only just begun to see the gains from electing actual progressive prosecutors.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this means that Harris should avoid mentioning Trump’s crimes. To the contrary, that’s exactly what her campaign should focus on when drawing a contrast between the candidates. But to do it effectively, Democrats need to move past broadly painting Trump as a “felon” and talk more specifically about what Trump actually did — and how his corruption defrauded voters. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The problem with reducing a race between two candidates to the prosecutor versus the felon is it’s turning the election and the choice voters have in front of them into a soundbite instead of an actual judgment on the values and the platform and the policies that either candidate runs on and owns,” Rahman, of Vera Action, said. “And voters deserve more and want more than soundbites.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the video that played at the DNC Monday night looked like a cheesy ad from a law-and-order campaign, it also highlighted why Trump has been held liable in civil court and convicted in criminal court for his misdeeds. “He lies, he rips off workers, he sexually abuses women,” the video said. “He cheats in business, he cheated on his wife with a pornstar and paid her off so the American people wouldn’t find out during an election.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The more specific Harris is, the more effective her message will be. After all, being convicted of a felony doesn’t disqualify someone from running for public office, and it shouldn’t mean that someone is inherently unfit to serve anyway. But the specifics of what Trump did — the lies and the fraud — make a more compelling case against him than any one label could.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Doug Emhoff is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-second-gentleman.html">just a guy</a> who loves his wife.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At countless <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-07-25/doug-emhoff-joins-call-for-wifes-black-queer-supporters-tells-of-learning-biden-was-out" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-07-25/doug-emhoff-joins-call-for-wifes-black-queer-supporters-tells-of-learning-biden-was-out">fundraisers</a> and campaign events, he gushes about his spouse of 10 years, vice president and current presidential candidate Kamala Harris. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-husband.html">gives interviews</a> about the importance of men supporting the women in their lives. He visits <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2024/07/24/doug-emhoff-husband-of-kamala-harris-campaigns-in-portland/">Planned Parenthood clinics</a> to champion reproductive rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is revolutionary stuff for the spouse of a top political leader, but Americans are so starved for high-profile male feminists — especially guys who don’t demand praise or <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/iexplorer/woke-bae-day">take themselves too seriously</a> — that Emhoff has claimed a prominent spot in the cultural zeitgeist. He’s a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/17/kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff">zaddy</a>, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/style/doug-emhoff-dunit-merchandise.html">pinup</a>, <a href="https://x.com/onedankmom/status/1815968661888184686">“TikTok’s white boy of the month.”</a>  He has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/style/doug-emhoff-dunit-merchandise.html">his own dedicated fan base</a> (which Vanity Fair has questionably christened <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/story/second-gentleman-doug-emhoffs-insatiable-fanbase">the D-Unit</a>). And now, as America’s potential first-ever “first gentleman,” he’s taking his biggest stage yet: On Tuesday, Emhoff will be speaking at the Democratic National Convention, and then is expected to introduce his wife as she accepts the Democratic nomination two nights later.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last man to help his wife campaign for president was former President Bill Clinton, who brought his own baggage to the role, and sometimes struggled not to make the campaign <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/10/05/496670378/is-bill-clinton-helping-or-hurting-his-wifes-campaign">all about him</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Emhoff, by contrast, has so far been able to serve as an advocate for his wife — and for American women in general — without hogging the spotlight himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, he’s already had to address a long-ago affair that <a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/08/kamala-harris-president-campaign-2024-husband-doug-emhoff.html">challenges his loyal wife-guy image</a>. And, if Harris is elected, he’ll have to chart his own course as the first man to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/fila/learn/historyculture/first-lady.htm">hold a quasi-official role</a> that, for centuries, has been defined by women.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The role of first spouse is already changing, with first ladies <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/News/jill-biden-make-history-1st-lady-hold-paid/story?id=75317759">keeping their jobs</a> and playing a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/opinion/michelle-obama-book-becoming.html">larger role in public life</a>. Emhoff could have the opportunity — and, some might argue, the responsibility — to transform it even further, ushering in a new era when a first spouse is not always a wife, and when young men can look to the White House to learn not just how to lead, but how to follow.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So who is Doug Emhoff, and what do his history and background say about how he might approach the role of first gentleman?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“I’m just, you know, a husband”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Emhoff and Harris <a href="https://www.vox.com/22242368/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-husband-vice-president">met in 2013</a>, and by all accounts were quickly smitten with each other. “The moment I met Kamala, I knew I was in love,” Emhoff <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/doug-emhoff-first-gentleman-vice-president-kamala-harris?utm_medium=social&amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_brand=gq&amp;utm_social-type=owned">wrote in GQ</a> in 2021. He was a successful lawyer, and she was already the attorney general of California. They married in 2014, and Harris <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a27422434/kamala-harris-stepmom-mothers-day/">became “Momala”</a> to his two teenage children from his first marriage, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/cole-ella-emhoff-kamala-harris-vance-childless-rcna163820">Cole</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/13/style/ella-emhoff-met-gala.html">Ella</a> (who have become <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/us/politics/kamala-harris-stepmom-cole-ella-emhoff.html">objects of public fascination</a> in their own right).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris and Emhoff maintained their separate careers, even as she ran for president in 2020 — until Joe Biden chose Harris as his running mate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the campaign trail, Emhoff served as his wife’s No. 1 fan and enthusiastic if slightly goofy surrogate. “I’m just, you know, a husband, and I’m here to tell people why I love Kamala,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-second-gentleman.html">reportedly told</a> Chasten Buttigieg, another <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/us/politics/political-spouse-chasten-buttigieg-doug-emhoff.html">popular political husband</a>, in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Harris became vice president, Emhoff appeared to take his role as second gentleman seriously, visiting the Library of Congress to learn more about <a href="https://x.com/DouglasEmhoff/status/1350462742457688066">previous second spouses</a>. “I understand that I am the first gentleman to hold this role,” he said at the time, “and I certainly do not want to be last.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Comments like that have made him a popular <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/17/kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff">crush</a> among feminists and progressives, who <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/kamala-harris-husband-doug-emhoff">call him a “hot Jewish dad”</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/05/style/doug-emhoff-dunit-merchandise.html">buy mugs</a> with his face on them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Emhoff presents his support for his wife not just as an act of love, but as an example of what a feminist husband can look like. “Lifting women up so that they can carry out important roles is a very manly thing,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/22/us/politics/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-husband.html">said in a 2022 interview</a>. “That is not taking away opportunities from men.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, how should a first gentleman be?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the role was invented in the 18th century, the first lady was simply supposed to “serve as the President’s hostess at social events,” <a href="https://www.ohio.edu/cas/jellison">Katherine Jellison</a>, a history professor at Ohio University who has studied first ladies, told Vox in an email. Eleanor Roosevelt is widely seen as the first presidential spouse to become a “public figure in her own right” and to champion a public-service cause, Jellison said. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though her immediate successors, Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower, didn’t follow that pattern, Jackie Kennedy devoted herself to the <a href="https://www.nypap.org/preservation-history/jacqueline-kennedy-onassis/">preservation and restoration of the White House</a> and other historic buildings, and every first lady since has devoted herself to at least one cause or issue, Jellison said. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/dr-jill-biden/">Jill Biden</a>, for example, works with military families and on the administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cancermoonshot/">cancer research initiative</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last three first ladies have also challenged Americans’ expectations that the role would be filled by “a white, U.S.-born woman who identifies primarily as a homemaker,” Jellison said. Michelle Obama, America’s first Black first lady, also came from a powerful career as a lawyer and hospital administrator — and <a href="https://qz.com/work/1477671/in-becoming-michelle-obama-recalls-falling-in-love-at-work">had been her husband’s superior</a> at work. Melania Trump was an immigrant, the first first lady to be born outside the US in <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2016/jul/19/melania-trump-could-be-first-non-us-born-first-lad/">nearly 200 years</a> (she also often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/opinion/sunday/want-melania-trump-in-the-white-house-pay-her.html">bowed out of the social aspects</a> of the role). Jill Biden has continued her career as a <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/administration/jill-biden">community college professor</a> and has served as a <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/13/jill-biden-democrats-2024">crucial adviser</a> to her husband.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The women who have most recently held the role of first lady reflect the greater diversity of American womanhood in the 21st century,” Jellison said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over time, the first lady’s hostess role has diminished — for example, neither <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/21/politics/trump-white-house-china/index.html">Melania Trump</a> nor Jill Biden chose a pattern of official White House china, a tradition <a href="https://www.whitehousehistory.org/press-room/press-timelines/white-house-china-service">since the 19th century</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As first gentleman, Emhoff would have the opportunity to go a step further, reflecting the diversity of relationships in America today — including those that began <a href="https://www.vox.com/22242368/doug-emhoff-kamala-harris-husband-vice-president">later in life</a>, create <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/us/kamala-harris-doug-emhoff-family-inauguration.html">blended families</a>, and allow space for a female partner to hold a high-powered, even all-consuming, job.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Emhoff is likely to bring his own priorities to the White House if his wife does end up there. “He might continue to follow Jill Biden’s lead and keep his ‘day job’ teaching law at Georgetown University,” Jellison said. He would also probably continue <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/09/world/europe/doug-emhoff-antisemitism-paris.html">speaking out against antisemitism</a>, an important role for him both personally and politically. He would be the first Jewish first spouse, as well as a key Jewish surrogate in the administration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One of “the nice men of the left”</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now that Harris is running for president, Emhoff’s brand of feminist masculinity stands in stark contrast to the more combative styles embraced by high-profile men across the aisle. When vice-presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance began to get renewed attention for his comments calling Harris a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/dear-j-d-vance-childless-cat-ladies-are-people-too.html">“childless cat lady,”</a> Emhoff responded that the remark had “hurt [his] feelings.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You’re telling a lot of people in this country and this world that they don’t matter,” he said in <a href="https://cafe.com/stay-tuned/kamala-harris-doug-emhoff/">an interview</a> with Vox Media <a href="https://podcasts.voxmedia.com/show/stay-tuned-with-preet">podcast host</a> and former federal prosecutor Preet Bharara.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s also shown himself able to talk easily about reproductive health care, something <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/366495/trump-medication-abortion-mifepristone">Trump certainly can’t match</a>. On a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/tim-walz-doug-emhoff-democrats-nice-men-of-the-left.html">recent visit to a Planned Parenthood clinic</a>, he talked about a “post-<em>Dobbs</em> hellscape” in which “you can’t get a Pap smear; you can’t get basic care.” He’s also <a href="https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/planned-parenthood-southeast-advocates/news/second-gentleman-of-the-united-states-doug-emhoff-joins-planned-parenthood-southeast-advocates-and-men4choice-encourages-men-to-be-active-allies-for-choice">described abortion restrictions</a> as “affecting all Americans, not just women.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s earned him praise from progressives, with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/tim-walz-doug-emhoff-democrats-nice-men-of-the-left.html">Rebecca Traister of New York magazine</a> describing Emhoff and presumptive vice presidential nominee Tim Walz as the “nice men of the left.” These men, Traister writes, “are presenting a different definition of masculine strength tied to women’s liberation and full civic participation and all but declaring it a new norm.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Emhoff had an easier job as second gentleman than he has as a top surrogate in his wife’s campaign, or than he’ll have if she wins. As his profile rises, he’s had to own up to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/us/politics/doug-emhoff-affair.html">an affair he had</a> during his first marriage, with a teacher at his children’s school.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions,” he said in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/03/us/politics/doug-emhoff-affair.html">a statement to the Times</a>. “I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The revelation of the affair threatens to tarnish Emhoff’s uxorious image somewhat — “What happens when it comes out that a wife guy has been a less-than-perfect spouse in the past?” <a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/08/kamala-harris-president-campaign-2024-husband-doug-emhoff.html">Heather Schwedel asks at Slate</a>. For now, many Americans seem willing to forgive (one X user <a href="https://slate.com/life/2024/08/kamala-harris-president-campaign-2024-husband-doug-emhoff.html">called him</a> a “born-again wife guy”). </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if Emhoff does find himself in the role of first gentleman, he’ll face more scrutiny — and new challenges.&nbsp;<br>Above all, however, Emhoff would have a chance, at a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24078282/zyn-pouches-tucker-carlson-schumer-republicans-2024">difficult</a><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361133/trump-assassination-attempt-rnc-men-guns"> </a><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361133/trump-assassination-attempt-rnc-men-guns">moment</a> for American masculinity, to show what it’s like to be a man in an important but secondary role. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">His last four years in public life have been built on the idea that there is dignity, honor, and joy in backing up the woman you love. In a time when women’s autonomy feels <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/354635/divorce-no-fault-states-marriage-republicans">ever more in question</a>, it may be the most important contribution he can make.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chicago is hosting the Democratic National Convention (DNC) this year. It’s a return to the city for Democrats, who hosted an infamous convention there in 1968 that descended into riots in the street and chaos on the convention floor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That year, Americans, and especially Democrats, were up in arms over the US involvement in the Vietnam War. Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy had been assassinated earlier that year, and the party entered the convention divided between pro- and anti-war candidates (Hubert Humphry and Eugene McCarthy, respectively). And unlike a contemporary major-party convention, 1968 wasn’t a coronation of one candidate: It would come down to how the delegates voted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, protesters are out in force to raise their voices against the US involvement in the war in Gaza. Two young activists we spoke with even mirrored language from 1968, saying, “The whole world is watching.” Thousands are marching across downtown Chicago today. With that in mind, <em>Today, Explained</em> reached out to historian, journalist, and Chicago resident Rick Perlstein to ask whether 2024 risks a repeat of the disaster of 1968.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s go back to the summer of ’68. What was the backdrop to the convention in August of that year?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rick Perlstein</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic Party was divided down the middle on the issue of the Vietnam War.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">[The party’s infighting was] escalated by a Democratic president, Lyndon Johnson, who believed [that by supporting the war] he was continuing the wishes of the martyred president, John F. Kennedy. A lot of Democrats saw [the war] as part of this great anti-communist crusade, and a lot of people saw it as imperialism — that we were interfering in another country’s civil war. The idea that we had to get out was very prevalent on the left wing of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Johnson decided he wasn’t going to run for president. So by the time delegates arrived at the convention, Johnson’s loyal vice president, Hubert Humphrey, was the nominee apparent. He had been coerced into loyally supporting the war, even though he had grave reservations about it. The question of whether he would be nominated or Eugene McCarthy [a Minnesota senator who was vocally anti-war] would be nominated was live in the air. It looked like Humphrey had it wired, but [the struggle between the two men] was kind of a proxy fight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, protesters from all over the country flooded in. There’s a separate Chicago context. Several months earlier that spring, there had been terrible riots [on the city’s south and west sides] after the assassination of Martin Luther King. There had been an anti-war rally a couple of weeks later, and there were terrible beatings [by police]. So there was dread and anticipation: What would happen when the city hosted thousands of protesters who were much more radical than the kind of protesters we see now? And everyone arrives in this city, which is run by this almost oligarchic mayor, Richard J. Daley, who intended no disorder in his city that he was putting on display for the entire world.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disorder came anyway. Tell me two things: What did Daley do to try to prevent disorder, and how did it go so very wrong?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rick Perlstein</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things he did to try to prevent disorder was to string along these two groups of protesters who wanted to come to the city by not granting them official permission to sleep in Lincoln Park. And that was the intention of the group who identified themselves as “hippies.” Their idea was they represented this new youth identity that was revolutionary and was going to completely overthrow bourgeois propriety.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And another group of people wanted to parade to the convention hall, and they were much more conventionally political. A lot of them were radical revolutionaries and the kind of people who would hoist flags of the enemy in Vietnam, the Viet Cong.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Daley put his foot down and said these long-haired miscreants aren’t going to get the time of day in our city, which only ratcheted up the tensions and made them even more determined. The protesters essentially said: “We’ll sleep in the park even if you don’t want us to. We’ll march to the convention hall even if you don’t want us to. We’ll put our bodies on the line, in both cases.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When did the violence begin?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rick Perlstein</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Immediately. The first night of the convention, the police came to this park, Lincoln Park, on the lakefront and started rousting the people who were trying to sleep there. An impromptu confrontation [with] the police happened. That was when a young person started chanting, “The whole world is watching” as the cops started beating up hippies. A fellow named Tom Hayden, one of the leaders of the revolutionary contingent, was arrested. His comrades tried to march to the police station in solidarity with him. The guy who was running the countercultural part of it, Abbie Hoffman, joined the march. He wrote on his forehead a four-letter word starting with F, so he could subvert the images on TV, a media guerrilla warrior.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Later, the protesters wanted to walk the several miles [from Lincoln Park] to the convention hall and the city didn’t want them to do it. So there was this mounting tension.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last day of the convention was Thursday, and that’s when they said, we’re going to walk to the convention come hell or high water. Mayor Daley says, no way. Meanwhile, his police, who have been seething since April, were feeling an itchy trigger finger. There was all kinds of fearful rhetoric on both sides.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Abbie Hoffman had promised that he was going to dump LSD into the Chicago water supply, which was a joke — it turns out there was not enough LSD on earth to affect the water supply — but the upright burghers of Chicago are terrified. And Tom Hayden would say things like, “If blood is going to flow, it should flow all over the city.” By which he meant if there are attacks on protesters, we should go in all the neighborhoods. But that was interpreted as an intent to attack innocent people all over the city.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You had this kind of enveloping dread leading up to the last day of convention, even as the debates over the platform are leading to actual violence inside the convention hall, including the arrest of Dan Rather, the CBS news correspondent, and all sorts of shoving and pushing and questions of what kind of credentials people would need, people getting beaten up for bringing protest signs inside the hall. So you had kind of these miniature civil wars breaking out inside among the actual credentialed delegates and outside among protesters and police.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What exactly was going on inside the convention and how rowdy did it actually get?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rick Perlstein</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most dramatic thing that happened inside the convention hall is that that Thursday night, when students were denied the right to march to the convention hall, they sat down right in front of [The Hilton Chicago] and police just started wading into the crowd and bashing people on the head. Word got into the convention hall that that was what was happening. They were doing the final vote for who would get nominated as president. There was a third candidate — George McGovern, who later won the nomination in 1972 — he was nominated by a liberal senator from Connecticut, Abraham Ribicoff. And Ribicoff said if George McGovern was the president of the United States, “We would not have to have Gestapo tactics in the streets of Chicago.” And when he said that, Mayor Daley shouted something you could not hear. Later, lip readers famously said that he had said Senator Ribicoff was “a no-good Jew bastard.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What else was going on outside the convention center? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rick Perlstein</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The marchers massed several miles down from the convention hall. The police are standing in the street in their way. The protesters try to walk around the policemen, and the policemen chase them back across the street. Next, the students did a sit-in strike, blocking the street right in front of the TV cameras, and hundreds of white-helmeted Chicago police just methodically started taking their nightsticks and beating these seated protesters. Police wagons lined up and they would grab young people by the scruff of their necks and throw them into police wagons. When there were enough for them to be full, they would throw a tear gas canister inside, and then smack the door closed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was all on TV. It was on all three channels. And there was this terrible backlash. The majority of the country very much believed that the Chicago police were in the right and the protesters were in the wrong. That was the very backlash against the forces of civil rights and anti-war activism and cultural shifts that Richard Nixon was running for president on, as the Republican candidate.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Noel King</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We decided to do this episode about the ’68 convention months ago, even before this year’s convention seemed exciting, because we kept reading in op-eds, “The DNC is in Chicago. 2024 is like 1968.” How much do you believe that to be true? And what is causing people to make that comparison?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Rick Perlstein</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until I started getting these calls from folks like you, it never occurred to me to understand the 2024 convention in my city, Chicago, by going back to what I studied and wrote [about] 1968. To me, everything from how presidents get chosen now compared to then; how protests in the street work now compared to then; how politicians respond to protests; how the entire apparatus of law enforcement and security work compared to then; how Chicago works, are just so different.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that made 1968 so shocking and galvanizing was that you could go into a convention and you didn’t know whether the presidential candidate was going to be Hubert Humphrey or Eugene McCarthy. Part of what the protesters were trying to do was influence how the convention would come out. Maybe there was a glimmer of possibility that that might have happened before the Democratic Party lined up behind Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">History is a process, it’s not parallels. We can’t have 1968 again because we already had 1968. A lot of the things that happened in 1968 are inconceivable in 2024. It doesn’t mean that interesting and even melodramatic and even possibly violent things might not happen in 2024, but those will happen for 2024 reasons. Those won’t happen for 1968 reasons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Correction, August 20, 12 pm ET, 2024: </em></strong><em>A previous version of this post misstated the last time the convention was held in Chicago. </em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With President Joe Biden speaking in the headlining role, the first night of the Democratic convention seemed like it was going to be about passing the torch. And it was — not that the Democrats on stage made that explicit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s address was late. It began around 11:30 pm Eastern time, so late that some pundits decided the DNC <a href="https://x.com/NateSilver538/status/1825733562164736054">had buried his speech on purpose</a> (a theory convention officials denied). When the president finally spoke, he entirely skipped over the obvious question raised by his presence: Why her and not him? Biden spent the vast bulk of the speech touting his own record in office, casting Harris as a champion of his legacy without spending a single word explaining why he needed a champion in the first place.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this, Biden was hardly alone. Throughout the night, Democrats made sure not to acknowledge the unprecedented move that led to the sitting president giving the leadoff speech instead of the convention finale. The convention basically acted like Biden was a second-term president legally barred from running for office, not a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/us/politics/pelosi-biden.html">president pushed aside by his own party</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This might seem awkward. But it was probably the best possible way to handle the situation.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The elephant in the donkey room?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political conventions are, in theory, multiday infomercials for the hosting party. They’re supposed to be carefully calculated to present the party in its best light, highlighting its strongest issues, most talented politicians, and clearest points of unity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, the Democrats do have a pretty good story to tell. Harris is surging in the polls, buoyed by a level of enthusiasm among the party base <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4824309-kamala-harris-campaign-obama-comparisons/">not seen since Barack Obama topped the ticket.</a> The economy is strong, crime is down, and there are no American troops dying in large-scale foreign wars. Things are so good, in fact, that election models and prediction markets alike now have her as a slight favorite to beat Donald Trump in November.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last thing you want to do is ruin the party by dwelling on the recent past&nbsp;— especially the nasty, still-fresh internal fight over whether to replace Biden with Harris. Yet could Democrats really avoid acknowledging that the party had just made history by swapping out a presidential nominee after the primary?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, it turns out —&nbsp;they could.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For most of the night, this felt natural. The programming focused on the choice facing voters in November, contrasting Harris (good!) with Trump (bad!). There was little need to dwell on Biden because he isn’t on the ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This only started to feel strange when the night moved toward Biden’s address, with speeches by Biden-world figures: Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, first lady Jill Biden, and the president’s daughter Ashley. There are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/08/14/biden-frustration-obama-pelosi-00173883">reports</a> that the president remains angry and resentful about the whole thing, and it’s hard to imagine that his speech getting pushed till late didn’t feel like salt in the wound.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This is awful. He literally set up a campaign and handed it over to them—do they have to cut him out of prime time?” a Biden aide griped to <a href="https://x.com/AlexThomp/status/1825732932981383533">Axios reporter Alex Thompson</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet when the time came, Biden stuck to the script. He talked about himself, of course, but didn’t say or do anything that could be perceived as obvious sour grapes about Harris. He, like everyone else, just ignored the succession question. And the problem more or less took care of itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This acquiescence reflects Biden’s more general political style.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Biden really did build and depend on a coalition instead of a cult of personality, to a greater degree than almost any modern POTUS,” writes <a href="https://x.com/MattGlassman312/status/1825758655238561933">Georgetown political scientist Matt Glassman</a>. “He’s just not beloved the way Obama or Clinton or Reagan or, well, Trump was. That comes across in his approach to policy making, his approach to public relations, and his relationship with the factions of the party.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Arguably, this is why Biden stepped aside amid party pressure when Trump would not (after the <em>Access Hollywood</em> tape, say, or the January 6 Capitol riot). But it also explains why Biden could resist the temptation to dwell on his own ouster and move on like it never happened.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He is, in the end, a party man.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Republican Party wants the Supreme Court to weigh in on a <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/republican-national-committee-v-mi-familia-vota/">nauseatingly complicated voting rights case</a>, which could potentially disenfranchise thousands of presidential voters in the swing state of Arizona. The case is known as <em>Republican National Committee v. Mi Familia Vota</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case involves an astoundingly convoluted system Arizona uses to register certain voters — one that emerged from 20 years of conflicting state and federal laws, plus seemingly endless litigation over those laws. Among other things, Republicans claim that several thousand Arizona voters should be allowed to vote only in congressional elections, and that they are barred from voting in state and local elections or voting for the president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2004, Arizona enacted a law which requires new voters to <a href="https://www.azleg.gov/ars/16/00166.htm">provide documentary proof of citizenship</a> (such as a passport or a birth certificate) when registering to vote in the state. This state law, however, conflicts with a federal law known as the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which requires states to register voters who submit a standardized federal registration form.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That form requires Arizona voters to swear, under penalty of perjury, that they are in fact citizens. But it does not require them to submit other proof of citizenship.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court confronted this conflict in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8524729836774698956&amp;q=n+Arizona+v.+Inter+Tribal+Council+of+Arizona&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,47&amp;as_vis=1"><em>Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council of Arizona</em></a> (2013), and largely resolved it in favor of the NVRA. <em>Inter Tribal</em> held that the state must allow voters to register using the federal form, but it also suggested that Congress’s power to require states to register voters is limited to “federal elections.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, in response to <em>Inter Tribal</em>, Arizona refused to fully register voters who submitted the federal form without providing proof of citizenship. Since <em>Inter Tribal</em>, these voters have been allowed to vote in federal elections (for Congress and the president), but not in state and local races in Arizona. According to an expert who testified in the <em>RNC</em> case, “approximately one-third of a [percent] of non-Hispanic White voters [in Arizona] are Federal-Only Voters, while a little more than <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A164/322042/20240808153230794_Application%20Appendix.pdf">two-thirds of a percent of minority voters are Federal-Only Voters</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This racial disparity likely explains why the Republican Party is now asking the Supreme Court to further restrict this small percentage of Arizona voters. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/exit-polls-arizona.html">2020 exit polls</a> showed Republican Donald Trump winning white voters in Arizona, but losing the state as a whole due to President Joe Biden’s strong performance with Latinos. Biden’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-arizona.html">margin of victory in Arizona in 2020</a> was about three-tenths of a percent, and even a tiny shift in the state’s population of eligible voters could tip the balance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <em>RNC</em> case, which is now before the Supreme Court, concerns a 2022 Arizona law which would impose three new restrictions on these federal-only Arizona voters. It bars them from voting by mail, and from voting for president altogether — thus limiting them to voting only in congressional elections. Additionally, the 2022 law requires the state to reject any new voter registration submitted using the state’s own form if that registration doesn’t include proof of citizenship — even though the state is still required to register that individual as a federal-only voter if the registrant submits the federal form.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The 2022 law, however, has never taken effect. This is true in part because several key statewide offices are controlled by Democrats, but also because the courts have taken a skeptical view of the law. In total, seven judges have heard the <em>RNC</em> case at some point in its journey through the federal judiciary, and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A164/322042/20240808153230794_Application%20Appendix.pdf">none of them voted</a> in favor of the provisions preventing federal-only voters from voting by mail or for president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, these lower-court judges split on the restrictions governing new registrants, although this is probably the least consequential of the 2022 law’s three restrictions. The last panel of judges to weigh in on that provision voted 2-1 to block it, at least for now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And so now it is up to the Supreme Court to decide whether to make this needlessly complicated morass even more complicated, potentially preventing thousands of Americans from voting for president in a key swing state.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So, how strong are the Republican Party’s arguments?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s get one disclaimer out of the way: We are talking about the same Supreme Court that recently held, despite no language in the Constitution that supports this position, that former President Donald Trump has <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/366855/supreme-court-trump-immunity-betrayal-worst-decisions-anticanon">broad immunity from prosecution</a> for crimes he committed while he was in office. The Court’s Republican supermajority <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/8/23784320/supreme-court-2022-term-affirmative-action-religion-voting-rights-abortion">does not always follow the law</a>, especially when the law cuts against the Republican Party’s preferred outcome. So, in a case where the GOP is asking these justices to make it easier for Republicans to win a presidential election, there is always some risk that the Court’s Republican majority will play ball.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, they’ll really have to stretch if they want to hand the GOP a victory in this case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The trial court that heard the <em>RNC</em> case concluded that the two most severe restrictions in the 2022 law — the prohibitions against voting by mail and voting for president — violate the NVRA, the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A164/322042/20240808153230794_Application%20Appendix.pdf">same law at issue in <em>Inter Tribal</em></a>. To justify its attempt to lock these voters out of the presidential election, the GOP points to a provision of the Constitution that gives Congress broad power to <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/article-1/">shape the “Times, Places, and Manner” for choosing members of Congress</a>, but that doesn’t give Congress the same power over presidential elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court has long held, however, that “the power of Congress to protect the election of President and Vice President from corruption” is “clear,” and that “the choice of means to that end presents a question <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/290/534/">primarily addressed to the judgment of Congress</a>.” So it is well-established that Congress can regulate presidential elections. This explains why every judge who considered the GOP’s argument, several of whom were appointed by Trump, voted to reject it.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also another reason why the Supreme Court should not reinstate these two provisions. In <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/06-375"><em>Purcell v. Gonzales</em></a> (2006), the Court warned that “federal courts ordinarily should not alter state election rules in the period close to an election.” While the Court has never stated precisely when the “period close to an election” begins, its Republican majority has read <em>Purcell</em> quite aggressively in the past. Justice Brett Kavanaugh has even suggested that the <em>Purcell</em> window opens up <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/2/8/22922774/supreme-court-merrill-milligan-alabama-brett-kavanaugh-racial-gerrymandering-voting-rights-act">more than nine months before a general election</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s now mid-to-late August. The 2024 election is just over two months away. And yet the GOP is asking the Supreme Court to alter Arizona’s election rules to impose new voting restrictions that have not previously taken effect and were enjoined by a federal trial court in 2023. <em>Purcell</em> should prevent the Court from giving the GOP what it wants in this case — at least until after the election happens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The RNC’s arguments in favor of the restrictions on new voter registrations are a little stronger. In 2018, Arizona settled a lawsuit. As part of that settlement, it agreed to register federal-only voters who submit the state’s own registration form rather than the federal form. The GOP now argues that the state legislature’s decision to enact a new law in 2022 <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24A164/322042/20240808153155295_Emerg.%20App.%20for%20Stay.pdf">overrides the 2018 lawsuit settlement</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a plausible argument, but the RNC’s request to reinstate this voter registration restriction during the 2024 election probably also runs afoul of <em>Purcell</em>. Again, <em>Purcell</em> held that courts should not alter a state’s election rules too close to an election, and Republicans are asking the Supreme Court to alter Arizona’s election rules in the final stretch before voters start casting ballots for president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, the <em>RNC</em> case will likely offer a window into whether this Court’s Republican majority will behave as honest brokers during the 2024 race. In past election cycles, Republican justices <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/6/21211378/supreme-court-coronavirus-voting-rights-disenfranchise-rnc-dnc">wielded <em>Purcell</em> very aggressively</a> to block lower-court decisions expanding voting rights — often in cases where Democrats supported the lower court’s approach. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s only fair that the Court read <em>Purcell</em> just as aggressively now that Republicans would benefit from a looser application of that decision.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2004, in one of the most high-profile trials of the past two decades, Scott Peterson was convicted of murdering his wife, Laci Peterson, 27, and their unborn son, Conner, with whom Laci was eight months pregnant. Now, two different new docuseries on the case — Netflix’s <em>American Murder: Laci Peterson</em> (released August 14)<strong> </strong>and Peacock’s<em> Face to Face with Scott Peterson </em>(releasing August 20) take different approaches to Peterson’s conviction and unresolved questions about what happened when Laci disappeared from their home in Modesto, California, on Christmas Eve in 2002.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The subsequent media frenzy over her disappearance drove national headlines for months. In spring of 2003, the bodies of both mother and son washed up in San Francisco Bay, just a few miles from where Peterson had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/08/05/peterson.trial/">gone fishing</a> the day Laci disappeared.</p>

<p>It’s rare for a criminal prosecution to have as much incriminating circumstantial evidence pointing toward the guilt of a single individual as prosecutors had in the case of Scott Peterson — “overwhelming evidence” with “no other reasonable explanation,” as one attorney who followed the trial <a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2004/11/13/circumstantial-evidence-made-murder-case/">described</a> at the time. The discovery included <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/laci-cops-chased-10000-tips/">42,000 pages</a> of documents. <a href="https://casetext.com/case/people-v-peterson-2050">The evidence against Peterson</a> included weeks of apparent planning, forensic evidence including mitochondrial DNA, and months of suspicious behavior both before and after the fact. Yet ever since a controversial 2017 docuseries helped circulate the idea that the case against Peterson was manufactured by a media circus rather than the facts of the investigation, websleuths have increasingly latched on to and bolstered belief in Peterson’s innocence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, the Los Angeles Innocence Project <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/innocence-project-takes-case-notorious-killer-scott-peterson/story?id=106487571">announced</a> that they had taken on Peterson’s case, making a “claim of actual innocence that is supported by newly discovered evidence.” It’s unclear what that evidence might be, but <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/scott-peterson-la-innocence-project-former-juror-attorney-weigh-in-new-case/">speculation</a> has run rampant, mainly focusing on <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/scott-peterson-case-new-evidence-innocence-project/14352815/">details</a> related to an infamous but <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/20/news/juror-from-scott-peterson-murder-trial-says-cops-ruled-out-burglary-link/">unconnected</a> robbery that happened across the street around the time of Laci’s death.</p>

<p>So how did we wind up here? It’s always healthy for the justice system to undergo scrutiny; after all, the court has already found that Peterson’s penalty phase was unjust. In 2020, Peterson’s original death sentence was <a href="https://deathpenaltyinfo.org/news/california-supreme-court-overturns-scott-petersons-death-sentence">overturned</a> due to improper jury selection, and he was <a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/scott-peterson-to-be-re-sentenced-for-murder-of-his-pregnant-wife/">resentenced</a> to life without parole. That’s arguably a good outcome, a case of the justice system self-correcting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yet the crusade for Peterson’s innocence seems to have very little to do with justice or even the actual facts of the case and more to do with external influences — from the bandwagon effect to the <a href="https://crimepiperblog.wordpress.com/2021/03/22/scott-peterson-crime-junkie-podcast-fact-checked-debunked/">outsize</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@paige__razor/video/7154135364352085294">influence</a> of a few podcasters and the gamification of <a href="https://www.vox.com/true-crime" data-source="encore">true crime</a> itself.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A media circus does not a false conviction make</h2>

<p>If you remember anything about the Scott Peterson case, you likely remember the Amber Frey of it all: Frey, Peterson’s girlfriend, found herself thrust into the center of a high-profile crime and under a constant media spotlight after she came forward to police. Frey did not know Peterson was married; he had told her weeks before<em> </em>Laci’s disappearance that he had <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna3403791">lost his wife</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frey was a star witness for the prosecution, a take-no-BS type who cooperated with authorities <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna6786735">for months</a> and made recordings of her conversations with Peterson. These included a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/amber-frey-remembers-recorded-calls-scott-peterson-shaking/story?id=49763587">notorious phone call</a> Peterson made to her on New Year’s Eve while attending a candlelight vigil for his murdered wife, in which he claimed to be in Paris, pretending the background noise of all Laci’s mournful supporters was coming from tourists at the Eiffel Tower. </p>

<p>(If you didn’t know that was a real thing that happened, then hello and welcome to a truly head-turning case.)</p>

<p>You probably also remember the incessant media coverage of this case at the peak of the 24-hour TV news cycle. Peterson’s <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=124563">infamous interview</a> with Diane Sawyer, in which he laughed in all the wrong places, led to endless <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-mind-of-scott-peterson/">analysis</a> of his <a href="https://www.vox.com/psychology" data-source="encore">psychology</a> and what it said about his guilt or innocence. Meanwhile, Frey appeared in an incendiary <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/2020/video/scott-petersons-affair-revealed-public-sparking-media-frenzy-77702525">press conference</a>, where she discussed the litany of lies Peterson had fed her both before and after Laci’s disappearance.</p>

<p>Recent advocates for Peterson’s innocence have heavily implied that <a data-source="encore" href="https://www.vox.com/media">the media</a> created a false narrative of his guilt. This theory was a core part of Peterson’s <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/scott-peterson-appeals-from-death-row-argues-he-received-unfair-trial-in-murder-of-wife-unborn-son/">denied 2012 appeal</a>, as well as A&amp;E’s inflammatory docuseries <a href="https://www.aetv.com/shows/the-murder-of-laci-peterson"><em>The Murder of Laci Peterson</em></a>. But there’s a difference between media interest in a case and media manipulation of a case. In fact, much of the contemporaneous reporting on the Peterson trial was <a href="https://pwc-sii.com/Media/case.htm">fair</a> and even <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/laci-dumped-at-scott-fishing-spot/">sympathetic</a> to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/12/11/court.archive.peterson7/index.html">the defense</a>. </p>

<p>The reality is that no amount of media sympathy could fully ameliorate the damage created by Peterson’s own behavior.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Scott Peterson never needed the media’s help to seem guilty</h2>

<p>Scott Peterson seemed to have the perfect life: a good job, a beautiful, smart wife who adored him, and a baby on the way. But (stop us if you’ve heard this one before) not everything was as it seemed. Peterson had been cheating on Laci with a string of women <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/09/28/peterson.trial/">since at least the beginning</a> of their five-year marriage. He did not want to be a father and told relatives he was “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/10/peterson.case/">hoping for infertility</a>.” Adding to the pressure was the intense <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/THE-PETERSON-TRIAL-Credit-card-debt-takes-2736606.php">financial strain</a> he was under; his business was failing, and two-thirds of his paycheck went toward paying off loans and interest on $20,000 in credit card debt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the morning of December 24, 2002, Scott Peterson claimed to have left Laci — his eight-and-a-half-month-pregnant wife — preparing to do some intense housecleaning, while he stopped off at his warehouse and then went fishing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Peterson would later tell authorities that he decided to take an impromptu fishing trip to Berkeley Marina, around 90 miles away and past several other more convenient bodies of water. He had previously told multiple neighbors and relatives that he <a href="https://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/scott-peterson-case/article3096545.html">planned to go golfing</a> that day, and later <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/THE-PETERSON-TRIAL-He-was-golfing-not-fishing-2750368.php">lied to some</a> of them about where he’d gone. As an explanation, he would claim to police that he decided it was “<a href="https://abc7news.com/scott-peterson-interview-death-row-laci/2414289/">too cold</a>” to go golfing, so by his telling, he spontaneously decided to go sit in a boat on the windy bay in <a href="https://weatherspark.com/h/d/557/2002/12/24/Historical-Weather-on-Tuesday-December-24-2002-in-San-Francisco-California-United-States#Figures-Temperature">40-degree weather</a> instead.</p>

<p>But nothing about the trip to the marina was spontaneous. Peterson, who was not a regular fisherman — he hadn’t had a regular fishing license <a href="https://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/scott-peterson-case/peterson-moving-toward-trial/article3096592.html">since 1994</a> — began researching fishing boats to buy on December 7, 2002. On December 8, he did extensive web searches for fishing supplies and tidal currents around the bay area, even <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/08/05/peterson.trial/">zooming in</a> on Brooks Island, where authorities believe he took Laci’s body on Christmas Eve. He paid cash for a small fishing boat on December 9 — the <a href="https://pwc-sii.com/Timeline/Prelim.htm">same day</a> that he told Amber Frey that he had “lost” his wife and that this would be his first Christmas without her. On December 23, the day before his supposedly unplanned fishing trip, he <a href="https://pwc-sii.com/CourtDocs/Exhibits/P-79.pdf">purchased</a> a fishing license valid for two days only.</p>

<p>Although he originally lied and told police he left home on Christmas Eve at 9:30 am, cellphone records placed him at or near home <a href="https://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/phone-call-casts-doubt-on-scott-peterson-s-alibi-1985323.php">at 10:08 am</a>, just 10 minutes before a neighbor <a href="https://us.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/10/peterson.trial/">found Laci’s dog</a> running loose in the street and returned him to the Petersons’ yard. After eventually driving to Berkeley Marina and fishing there for less than an hour, he arrived back home at around 4:30 pm, washed his fishing clothes, ate some pizza, and then called Laci’s mother to tell her that her daughter was “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/petersons-alibi-in-question/">missing</a>.”</p>

<p>Despite the reams of circumstantial evidence, direct evidence in the case was scant. Peterson’s blood was found on the door of his truck, for which he gave conflicting explanations. A few drops of blood were <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/the-peterson-trial-only-4-droplets-of-blood-2725148.php">also found</a> on their bedroom comforter. Caught in a pair of pliers recovered from Peterson’s boat, police found hair matched to Laci’s through <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna3474357">mitochondrial DNA testing</a>, an inconclusive but still genetic match — but Laci allegedly <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/the-peterson-trial-wife-never-spoke-of-affair-2753651.php">never knew</a> about the boat. Prosecutors also found evidence that he’d made <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/anchor-evidence-in-scott-peterson-trial/">multiple cement anchors</a>, only one of which was located, and which they believed he used to weigh down Laci’s body.</p>

<p>Peterson’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/06/10/peterson.case/">odd behavior</a> continued after Laci disappeared. He made strange statements to friends and relatives about the cuts on his hand; he displayed a prevailing lack of emotion; he seemed reluctant to participate<strong> </strong>in search parties to look for her or press conferences about her.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His cooperation with police “was always conditional,” investigators <a href="https://people.com/archive/the-peterson-case-how-they-got-scott-vol-63-no-20/">told People</a> in 2005. “He was concerned about the wrong things.” He made repeated non-fishing trips to the marina, 90 miles away, only to “<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/13/ctv.peterson.case/">stare into the bay</a>” and then leave again after a few minutes. This was in January, months before Laci’s body would eventually be found in the bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The same day their bodies were identified, Scott Peterson dyed his hair, borrowed <a href="https://people.com/crime/scott-petersons-car-had-sleeping-pills-weapons-cash/">his brother’s photo ID</a>, and <a href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/story/news/2003/04/21/scott-peterson-carrying-10k-cash/51273085007/">headed for the Mexico border</a> with over $10,000 in cash. The final jury <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/10/us/jury-begins-deliberating-scott-petersons-punishment.html">needed just seven hours</a> to convict him and ultimately sentence him to death.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Innocence advocates have to ignore much of the evidence to make their case&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.modbee.com/news/local/crime/scott-peterson-case/article274847271.html">biggest argument</a> Peterson’s defenders have that another perpetrator committed the murders is that a burglary occurred just down the street. Peterson and his advocates argue that the two perpetrators of that burglary, Donald Pearce and Steven Todd, burgled the house on the morning of December 24 and that in the process, they abducted Laci Peterson. Since (according to Peterson) Laci was walking her dog that morning, his supporters typically believe she must have run across the burglars in the middle of the robbery, attracted their attention, and been murdered as a result. They theorize that Pearce and Todd waited for several days and then dumped her body in the region of the bay where Scott Peterson went fishing on December 24, all in order to frame him for the murder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But this idea doesn’t stand up to scrutiny, for numerous reasons. Even if we accept the absurd hypothesis that two thieves would abduct and kill a pedestrian in broad daylight, do nothing about it for a day or two until their murder victim became headline news, and then risk driving 90 miles to dump the high-profile victim’s body in an area where they already knew police were searching, all to frame a husband whom police already suspected, the timeline doesn’t work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Laci went missing on December 24. The robbers didn’t break into the neighboring house <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/2-suspects-cleared-in-modesto-case-arrested-in-2687813.php">until the morning</a> of the 26th. Both Pearce and Todd were investigated and cleared by investigators in 2003, and both cooperated fully with police. And even if the robbers could have lied about when they broke into the home, that still doesn’t work, because the residents of the home they robbed, the Medina family, didn’t leave their house on December 24 until approximately 10:33 am based on their <a href="https://pwc-sii.com/CourtDocs/Transcripts/Medina-Pros.htm">cellphone records</a> — nearly a half hour after Scott Peterson left and 15 minutes after the dog was seen wandering the streets solo. </p>

<p>Another conspiracy theory was one originally touted by Peterson’s defense at trial: the idea that Laci was killed as part of a ritual sacrifice and that Conner was removed from the womb alive. The main reason such a ludicrous theory could emerge (a theory <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/06/16/ctv.peterson/">dismissed by media</a> at the time as classic <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22358153/satanic-panic-ritual-abuse-history-conspiracy-theories-explained">satanic panic</a>) is that the bodies washed ashore at different times; however, the pathologist who conducted the autopsies on both bodies <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/the-peterson-trial-pathologist-baby-was-2693350.php">was confident</a> that Conner died in the womb as a result of his mother’s death.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among the most common reasons people give for arguing that Laci was still alive and well on the morning of the 24th is that multiple witnesses claimed to have seen her walking her dog. But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JobsBiszz70">according to investigators</a>, none of those eyewitness reports were consistent or verifiable. Many were based on media reports of what Laci was wearing — reports that originally came from Peterson, who claimed that Laci had been wearing black pants. When her body was found, however, <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/the-peterson-trial-wife-never-spoke-of-affair-2753651.php">she was wearing khaki pants</a>. This matched what her sister had <a href="https://www.lifenews.com/2004/06/04/nat-553/">seen her wearing</a> the night of December 23 — the night authorities believe Peterson murdered her.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do we know when someone is guilty of murder?</h2>

<p>One of the pitfalls of living in an era of advanced forensic science is that it’s easier for a defense to argue that a dearth of forensics must equate to a dearth of evidence. But for most of human history, the primary way we’ve decided whodunnit is by collecting good old-fashioned clues — that is, circumstantial evidence. Circumstantial evidence isn’t always compelling, and it can often be explained away effectively by a defendant. But the more there is of it, the less reasonable alternate explanations become. In Scott Peterson’s case, he and his defense team have ready answers for every piece of incriminating evidence against him, except for the biggest question of all: Why is there so much incriminating evidence against him? </p>

<p>As a society, we pay a lot of attention to what it means to prove something beyond a reasonable doubt. We spend much less time contemplating what unreasonable doubt might look like. Perhaps we should be paying more attention to the latter, if only so more cases like this one don’t squander too much of our cultural time and attention. The number of true crime devotees and <a data-source="encore" href="https://www.vox.com/influencers">influencers</a> who believe in Peterson’s innocence may be growing, but <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23506125/casey-anthony-evidence-where-the-truth-lies-how-true-or-false">not every claim</a> of innocence is built on rational thinking. </p>

<p>To justify Scott Peterson’s behavior, you have to posit a set of extraordinary circumstances, including that he just so happened to mention his wife’s demise to his girlfriend, coincidentally in the very same week he abruptly evinced an interest in fishing for the first time since the ’90s, coincidentally buying the same boat where her hair would later be found, after he coincidentally went fishing in the same region of the bay where her body would eventually be found, all while coincidentally lying repeatedly about his own actions. In a fictional scenario, it might be fun to imagine that all those details could be the result of some bizarre surprise explanation. But in the real world, a world where homicide by their intimate partners is <a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/homicide-is-a-leading-cause-of-death-in-pregnant-women-in-the-us/">a leading cause of death</a> for pregnant women, we know better. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or at least we should — if only for the sake of the next Laci Peterson.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Supreme Court handed down a brief and very odd opinion on Friday that seemed to abandon its landmark civil rights decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf"><em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em></a> (2020), a four-year-old case that compelled the Biden administration to write rules forbidding discrimination against gay and trans students.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court’s new decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/24a78_f2ah.pdf"><em>Department of Education v. Louisiana</em></a> temporarily leaves in place lower court decisions that blocked Biden administration regulations that, among other things, seek to <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/363215/supreme-court-transgender-schools-bathrooms-tennessee-louisiana">curb anti-LGBTQ discrimination by schools and universities</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden administration’s rules seemed to be crafted with <em>Bostock </em>compliance in mind — indeed, had a key provision of those rules been written any other way, they would have been illegal under <em>Bostock</em>. And yet the Court ruled against this provision regardless.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em>, briefly explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Bostock </em>held that a federal anti-discrimination law that bans “sex” discrimination in the workplace forbids employers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The opinion is written in expansive terms, indicating that any law that prohibits “sex” discrimination also bars discrimination against LGBTQ people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in <em>Bostock</em>, “it is <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf">impossible</a> to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.” The Court reasoned that, if a male employee is allowed to date women, to dress in traditionally masculine clothing, or to otherwise present as a man, then a female employee must be allowed to do these same things. Otherwise, the employer is treating men differently than women, and that’s illegal sex discrimination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With <em>Bostock </em>in mind, the Biden administration recently released new regulations interpreting a law known as “Title IX,” which prohibits any school or other educational institution that receives federal funds from discriminating “<a href="https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/tix_dis.html">on the basis of sex</a>.” Most public schools, colleges, and universities receive at least some federal grant money or assistance, so Title IX broadly protects against sex discrimination in education.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because <em>Bostock</em> ruled that it is “impossible” to discriminate against a gay or transgender person without discriminating based on sex, the Biden administration’s new rules define discrimination “on the basis of sex” to include “discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, pregnancy or related conditions, <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/363215/supreme-court-transgender-schools-bathrooms-tennessee-louisiana">sexual orientation, and gender identity</a>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before Friday, moreover, the Court’s decision in <em>Bostock</em> appeared safe from its Republican supermajority. <em>Bostock</em>, after all, was handed down in 2020, after former President Donald Trump had already appointed two of the three justices he would eventually place on the Court. And the majority opinion was <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf">authored by Gorsuch and joined by Chief Justice John Roberts</a>, both Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, even after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death gave Republicans a 6-3 supermajority on the Court, it appeared that there were still five justices remaining who agreed with <em>Bostock</em>’s reasoning. The decision in <em>Louisiana</em>, however, creates serious doubt about whether this Court will still protect LGBTQ people from discrimination.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So what did the <em>Department of Education v. Louisiana </em>decision actually say?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court split 5-4 in its <em>Louisiana </em>decision, although along fairly narrow lines. Indeed, one of the most inexplicable things about this case is that all three of the Court’s Democrats appeared to agree with the conclusion that <em>Bostock</em> does not protect LGBTQ students from discrimination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden administration regulations at issue in <em>Louisiana</em> did far more than just apply <em>Bostock</em> to educational settings. It included two other provisions benefitting LGBTQ students, including one that requires schools to allow trans students to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity, and another prohibiting schools from engaging in certain forms of “unwelcome sex-based conduct.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The red-state plaintiffs in <em>Louisiana</em> challenged these two provisions, plus the provision defining “sex” discrimination the same way it was defined in <em>Bostock</em>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, the regulations also include a bevy of new rules that the red-state plaintiffs did not challenge, but lower courts blocked anyway. These include new rules governing the rights of pregnant students and school employees, rules permitting parents to act on behalf of students who face discrimination, and new definitions of terms that often arise in Title IX disputes — such as “disciplinary sanctions” or “postsecondary education.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In defending the Department of Education, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/363215/supreme-court-transgender-schools-bathrooms-tennessee-louisiana">did not ask the Court to reinstate</a> the bathrooms provision or the “unwelcome sex-based conduct” provision — although it will likely do so later after this litigation has progressed further in the lower courts. It did ask the Court to reinstate the provision implementing <em>Bostock</em>, as well as the other various provisions that were blocked by lower courts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, five justices (all six of the Court’s Republicans except for Gorsuch), decided to give the Justice Department nothing. The lower court decisions blocking the entire set of regulations will remain in effect, at least for now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four justices (all three of the Court’s Democrats plus Gorsuch) dissented, but their dissent is quite narrow. They argued that the lower courts erred by “blocking the Government from enforcing scores of regulations that [the plaintiffs] never challenged and that bear no apparent relationship to [plaintiffs’] alleged injuries.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On this point, the dissenters are correct. The Supreme Court previously held in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-1161_dc8f.pdf"><em>Gill v. Whitford</em></a> (2018) that, when a court finds a legal violation, the “remedy must of course be limited to the inadequacy that produced the injury in fact that the plaintiff has established.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the dissenters agree with the majority that the lower court orders blocking the definition of “sex” discrimination — again, a definition that is lifted from the Court’s decision in <em>Bostock</em> — should also remain in effect. Neither the majority nor the dissent explain why they appear to be abandoning <em>Bostock</em>. Indeed, <em>Bostock</em> is not cited anywhere in either the majority opinion or the dissent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s possible that the three Democrats voted the way that they did for reasons that have nothing to do with whether they agree with <em>Bostock</em>. <em>Louisiana</em> arrived at the Court on its “<a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/11/21356913/supreme-court-shadow-docket-jail-asylum-covid-immigrants-sonia-sotomayor-barnes-ahlman">shadow docket</a>,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that receive expedited treatment by the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court used to be very reluctant to do anything at all on its shadow docket — so reluctant, in fact, that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/11/21356913/supreme-court-shadow-docket-jail-asylum-covid-immigrants-sonia-sotomayor-barnes-ahlman">lawyers historically were very cautious about bringing cases on the shadow docket to begin with</a>. Starting in the Trump administration, however, the Court’s Republican majority started granting shadow docket relief very often to Trump’s Justice Department, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/12/2/21726876/supreme-court-religious-liberty-revolutionary-roman-catholic-diocese-cuomo-amy-coney-barrett">later to other conservative litigants</a>. During this period, the Court’s Democratic minority <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/9/12/20862320/sotomayor-supreme-court-favors-trump">often complained</a> that their Republican colleagues were too quick to grant relief on the shadow docket.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So one explanation for the Democratic justices’ votes in <em>Louisiana</em> is that they are trying to stick to a principled position on the shadow docket — refusing to grant relief to the Biden administration for the same reason they said the Court should have denied relief to the Trump administration four years ago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, if the Democratic justices were asserting a principled stance against the shadow docket, why did they vote to reinstate the unchallenged provisions of the new Title IX rules?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another possibility is that the Democratic justices moderated their position in an attempt to secure five votes. Perhaps the three Democrats thought they could persuade two of their Republican colleagues to reinstate the unchallenged Title IX rules if they did not push to also reinstate the definition of sex discrimination?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But, if the Democratic justices’ walked away from <em>Bostock</em> as part of a horse-trading negotiation, they also walked away without a horse. In the end, only Gorsuch joined them in voting to reinstate the unchallenged regulations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any event, no member of the Court’s Republican majority stood behind <em>Bostock</em>, and none of them explained why they refused to do so either. All of the justices owe Americans an explanation for why they refused to block lower court orders that are clearly and unambiguously at odds with a binding Supreme Court precedent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the <em>Louisiana</em> decision is an enigma. The justices aren’t telling us why they refused to follow <em>Bostock</em>. But, regardless of their reasons, the Court’s decision not to follow this landmark civil rights decision is an ominous sign for all victims of anti-LGBTQ discrimination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cuba is suffering a nationwide blackout after the collapse of its electrical grid. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/cuba-shuts-down-most-businesses-amid-deepening-power-crisis-2d60829c">Power went out all over the island Friday</a>, just days before Tropical Storm Oscar hit the island as a category 1 <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article294358669.html">hurricane on Sunday</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though power has been partially restored in some areas, including much of Havana, millions of people — particularly in rural areas and in the eastern provinces, which bore the brunt of hurricane damage — are still without power on Tuesday. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The blackout is the culmination of decades of disinvestment, an economic crisis, and global factors affecting the country’s oil supply, and there doesn’t seem to be a long-term solution to the crisis. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Cuban government regularly imposes hours-long blackouts in different parts of the country to conserve the fuel necessary to run the electrical plants. But the current outage is different. It was sparked by a breakdown at one of the country’s aging electrical stations and has affected every facet of life for ordinary people: They cannot cool or light their homes, food is spoiling in refrigerators, they cannot cook, and many can’t access water to drink or wash.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the situation has now reached a crisis point, it’s a tragedy that has developed over time and emphasizes Cuba’s fragile economy, development imperatives, and its tenuous place in world politics.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did all of Cuba lose power?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The crisis started in earnest midday Friday, when the Antonio Guiteras power plant, one of the country’s largest, went offline. Seven of the country’s eight thermoelectric plants, which generate power for the island, were not working or under maintenance prior to the Guiteras plant’s failure. So when the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/how-cubas-electrical-grid-collapsed-what-comes-next-2024-10-18/">Guiteras plant shut down</a>, there were no more energy sources. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since Friday’s failure, the grid has partly or totally <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-restoring-power-again-after-multiple-grid-failures-2024-10-21/">collapsed three additional times</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The government blamed the failure on a combination of high electrical demand, poorly maintained energy facilities, a lack of fuel to run them, and stringent US sanctions. Officials, including Cuba’s President Miguel Díaz-Canel, have promised that the government is working around the clock to restore power to the island.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The government has restored full <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article294260464.html">functionality to some hospitals</a>, but others run on generators, a luxury not accessible to most Cubans. This could become a problem the longer the blackout continues, as the fuel generators require to operate is in short supply.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of Monday, much of the capital Havana was back online, according to energy officials. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-restoring-power-again-after-multiple-grid-failures-2024-10-21/">Technicians also restored functionality to the Antonio Guiteras plant</a>, providing at least some power to other regions, although the eastern tip of the island remains offline as of this writing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is Cuba’s energy problem so severe?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cuba’s electrical grid is so fragile due to a combination of factors: a lack of investment in infrastructure (of all kinds, not just the power grid); a lack of access to fuel to run the power plants; and impeded access to the global market are chief among them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Cuban government’s inability or unwillingness to maintain the country’s electrical plants is the direct cause of the blackouts; with most thermoelectric plants offline for one reason or another, Cuba was dependent on one plant to supply power to the island —&nbsp;which created this week’s crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But a broader problem has to do with Cuba’s economy and its ability to access the fuel it needs to run its power plants.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba essentially bartered its sugar for oil from the USSR. Following the USSR’s collapse in 1991, Cuba suffered an oil shortage and an economic crisis until Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela and began offering Cuba below-market-rate oil in exchange for Cuban medical services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Nowadays, you&#8217;re seeing a situation where all these countries have issues of their own to deal with. Russia is dealing with Ukraine. <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/363558/venezuela-maduro-elections-south-america-machado-gonzalez-chavez-oil">Venezuela is dealing with its own internal turmoil</a>,” Daniel Pedreira, a professor of politics and international studies at Florida International University, told Vox. Russia, Venezuela, and Mexico still provide Cuba with oil, but it’s just not enough to meet the country’s needs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Without access to discounted fuel, the Cuban government has had to turn to the open market. But fuel is more expensive there, and the country is short on cash. Cuba has little access to foreign currency reserves because its exports are low. Furthermore, two major sources of foreign currency — remittances from abroad and tourism — <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2017/6/16/15820484/trump-new-cuba-policy-speech-obama">decreased under the Trump administration</a> and Covid-19 pandemic following new US restrictions on US-Cuba relations and travel restrictions to stop the spread of disease.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What effect will the blackout have on Cubans?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The blackout itself is a crisis, but Sunday’s hurricane compounds it. <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article294358669.html">Oscar hit the eastern province of Guantánamo</a>, causing unprecedented levels of flooding given that area’s extremely dry climate. The continued power outage has hindered efforts to evacuate the region and complicated search-and-rescue efforts. Six people have been reported dead in the area since Oscar hit, though the circumstances of their deaths aren’t clear. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the rest of the country, some Cubans have been on the street protesting, despite the sharp warnings from Díaz-Canel, who said in a public address that such actions would not be tolerated and “<a href="https://apnews.com/video/cuba-havana-protests-and-demonstrations-cuba-government-power-outages-cf90011c95d842c9a266b4e7b2802e1a">will be prosecuted with the rigor that the revolutionary laws contemplate</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, protests don’t seem to have grown into a mass movement for political change. According to Pedreira, Cubans do not seem to hold Díaz-Canel with the same regard as they did the Castro regime. But the regime does have significant power to enact violence against protesters, and crackdowns against dissidents have been on the rise in recent years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If these blackouts really become even longer lasting, and really are the catalyst for political change or some sort of mass uprising, will the Cuban troops fire on Cuban civilians en masse?” Pedreira said. “We would have to wait and see if it happens or not. But as far as capacity, as far as the ability to do it, [the government] certainly can.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if there were a significant call for regime change, there’s nothing to change to, according to William LeoGrande, a professor of government and specialist in Latin American affairs at American University.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Discontent has been growing and is pretty widespread right now, [but] there isn&#8217;t any real organized opposition,” LeoGrande said. “The government makes it a lot easier for you to leave the country than to stay there and be a dissident. And so, you know, that&#8217;s what people do. And even ordinary people who are just discontent and fed up, their inclination is just to leave.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This crisis could fuel a further exodus; an estimated <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article290249799.html">1 million Cubans have left the country in the past three years</a>, the largest such migration in the country’s history. One Havana-based economist, Omar Everleny, told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/21/world/americas/cuba-blackout-hurricane-oscar.html?smid=url-share">New York Times</a> he’s already starting to see a new wave of emigration: “Anyone who was thinking of leaving is now accelerating those plans. Now you’re hearing ‘I am going to sell my house and go.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the government and those who stay, LeoGrande suspects “they&#8217;ll muddle through because they always seem to find a way to muddle through.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite what a new HBO documentary suggests, the identity of one of the richest people in the world is still unknown.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By now, the story is so famous it’s taken on the aura of a creation myth: One day in early 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonym used by the inventor of bitcoin, released the world’s first cryptocurrency. Two years later, Nakamoto vanished seemingly forever. Since then, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/7-people-who-could-be-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto">countless</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1b12azf/satoshi_nakamoto_was_john_nash_the_inventor_of/">theories</a> on who the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/craig-wright-perjury-bitcoin-trial">real Nakamoto</a> is have been advanced, with no single candidate coming out on top.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Nakamoto’s anonymity is merely an entertaining mystery, a necessity for privacy, or a worrisome concern depends on who you ask. For filmmaker Cullen Hoback, whose documentary <em>Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery</em> premiered on HBO last week, finding the mysterious bitcoin founder is a matter of public interest — and Hoback believes he has unmasked him as a 39-year-old Canadian bitcoin developer named Peter Todd. Since the film’s release, Todd and other prominent voices in the community have dismissed Hoback’s arguments; Todd reiterated to Vox in an email that he is not Nakamoto. According to these voices, Nakamoto remains an enigma. Many bitcoin enthusiasts prefer it that way.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s obvious why the search has endured over the past 15 years. Bitcoin is far and away the most popular digital currency in the world, with a market cap of about $1.3 trillion at the time of writing. (For comparison, the second biggest, ethereum, has a market cap of $312 million.) For those who believe a decentralized alternative to government-issued currencies — like the US dollar — is crucial to protect individual privacy and freedom, Nakamoto is akin to Prometheus bringing the gift of fire from the gods.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s this mind-boggling possibility: If <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/how-much-bitcoin-does-satoshi-nakamoto-own-number-will-blow-your-mind">reports</a> that Nakamoto might hold as much as 1.1 million bitcoins are true, they could be sitting on a fortune of over $70 billion, making them one of the 25 wealthiest individuals on Earth, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#495d947a3d78">Forbes’s real-time billionaires ranking</a>. But Nakamoto doesn’t seem to have spent any of it — at least, not anything in their confirmed bitcoin wallets. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What does it mean for the rest of us that such an enormous treasure chest remains in the hands of an unknown entity, whose true aims and intentions can’t be determined? Who benefits if Nakamoto remains in the shadows — and who benefits if they’re revealed?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">What we know about the bitcoin creator</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The internet user Satoshi Nakamoto first appeared in 2008, when they published a paper to a cryptographic technology mailing list laying out a system that they had dubbed bitcoin. It would function as a form of digital cash that people could use to send money back and forth without involving a bank. In other words, one could reliably make and receive payments anonymously.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There was a clear ideological aim: In Nakamoto’s view, the ability to keep your financial record out of the surveillance and reach of powerful authorities — whether it’s large private banks or the government — is an important personal freedom. Such institutions, after all, aren’t infallible. In one illuminating forum post in 2009, <a href="https://p2pfoundation.ning.com/forum/topics/bitcoin-open-source">Nakamoto wrote</a> that “the root problem with conventional currency” was “trust.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve,” they continued. “We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.” When Nakamoto created the first block that would become the bitcoin blockchain, they included a message <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-genesis-block:-the-first-bitcoin-block">referencing a headline</a> in the British newspaper the Times <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/chancellor-alistair-darling-on-brink-of-second-bailout-for-banks-n9l382mn62h">that day</a>: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The top suspects, and why Nakamoto’s identity is still up for debate</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nakamoto’s writings indicate they’re most likely someone with a strong understanding of economics, computer science, and modern cryptography, which involves methods and technologies for keeping information secure, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22226618/what-is-signal-whatsapp-telegram-download-encrypted-messaging">encrypting a message</a> that can only be unlocked with a special key. Unsurprisingly, the commonly advanced candidates for who Nakamoto could be are self-identified “cypherpunks,” a community of mainly computer scientists who advocate for using cryptography to protect digital privacy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Hoback, director of <em>Money Electric</em>, Peter Todd fits the bill. Todd is a libertarian pro-privacy advocate who, among other things, is a <a href="https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1646601411377999872">huge</a> <a href="https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1766100934503936511">proponent</a> <a href="https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1841832099923230804">of using cash</a> because it’s harder for governments and banks to track your spending. As a teenager, he was already communicating with older, respected cypherpunks and seemed unusually knowledgeable about bitcoin despite his youth. Todd would have been 23 years old when the bitcoin white paper was published.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoback builds his case primarily on the fact that Todd joined the message board Bitcointalk.org in 2010 right before Nakamoto stopped posting. But the crux of Hoback’s argument hinges on an interaction between Todd and Nakamoto on Bitcointalk. Nakamoto had <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2181.msg28729#msg28729">posted something technical</a> about how bitcoin transactions work; about an hour and a half later, Todd <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2181.msg28739#msg28739">replied</a> with a small disagreement. Hoback contends the reply actually reads more like someone finishing their previous thought — that Todd had signed into the wrong account to make an addendum to the original Nakamoto post. In the film, he also points to a chat log in which Todd calls himself a foremost authority on sacrificing bitcoin, which Hoback connects to the fact that Nakamoto hasn’t done anything with their coins in all these years (at least, that we know of).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s an intriguing interpretation, but not exactly a smoking gun.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoback, both in interviews and within <em>Money Electric</em>, portrays Todd as someone who enjoys playing games over whether he could be the bitcoin founder, laughing on camera as the filmmaker explains why he believes Todd is Nakamoto — at one point saying with a smirking grin, “Well, yeah. I’m Satoshi Nakamoto.” On X, though, Todd has <a href="https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1843789750983110697">firmly denied</a> he’s Nakamoto. In an email to Vox, Hoback wrote that Todd stopped speaking to him after filming this scene. Todd told Vox in an email that Hoback hadn’t been forthcoming about his intention to find out Nakamoto’s identity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The other main person of interest in <em>Money Electric</em> is Adam Back, a British cypherpunk in his 50s whose work toward a functional digital currency was cited in Nakamoto’s original bitcoin paper. One reason Hoback finds Back suspicious is that he became more active in the bitcoin world — specifically concerned with how to make transactions <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/27-year-old-codebreaker-busted-myth-bitcoins-anonymity/">completely anonymous</a> — right after <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=175996.msg1832533#msg1832533">speculation emerged</a> that Nakamoto controlled over 1 million bitcoins, more than previously thought. Unlike Todd, Back has stridently distanced himself from even joking suggestions that he could be Nakamoto.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other commonly floated contenders include prominent cypherpunk figures such as Hal Finney, who died in 2014 and was the recipient of the first test bitcoin transaction that Nakamoto sent, and <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nick-szabo-bitcoin-hbo-satoshi-nakamoto">Nick Szabo</a>, who came up with the concept of “smart contracts,” a crucial function of many blockchains today. One wild suggestion claims that the Japanese etymology behind Satoshi Nakamoto can roughly translate to “<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/who-is-satoshi-nakamoto/">central intelligence</a>,” a sign that bitcoin was in fact invented by the CIA as some sort of trap. Another conspiracy theory — practically a meme at this point — posits that Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk is the real Nakamoto. (He <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/elon-musk-denies-he-is-bitcoin-creator-satoshi-nakamoto.html">denies</a> it.)</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/GettyImages-1341873890.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729780130345,100,78.540439739309" alt="A gold statue with a bronze top and a hood is set atop a stone brick that reads Satoshi Nakamoto " title="A gold statue with a bronze top and a hood is set atop a stone brick that reads Satoshi Nakamoto " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A statue honoring the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, in Budapest, Hungary. | Janos Kummer/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Janos Kummer/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">It isn’t clear whether Nakamoto is still alive, or even whether they’re one person rather than a group of people working together. Early this year, an unknown person <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-community-bitcoin-transfer-satoshi-genesis-block">sent 26.9 bitcoins</a> (worth approximately $1.8 million today) to Nakamoto’s dormant wallet, firing up fresh excitement over where Nakamoto is and what they might be doing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How do you track down a mystery like Nakamoto? Should you even try?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since 2011, Nakamoto hasn’t emailed or posted anywhere under their username. They also haven’t used the crypto wallets associated with that name.<strong> </strong>But even if someone is determined to remain in the shadows, and has left no obvious evidence giving them away, there are bound to be some breadcrumbs. Much of the theorizing around Nakamoto depends on analyzing their style of coding and writing. Hoback, at one point in the film, nods to the fact that <a href="https://mmalmi.github.io/satoshi/#email-24">Nakamoto</a> and <a href="https://x.com/peterktodd/status/1644557915703869442">Todd</a> both used slurs that could <a href="https://x.com/CullenHoback/status/1843893419443359867">indicate immaturity</a>. Another commonly noted marker is that Nakamoto often used British English spelling (such as “favour”), and Todd is Canadian.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But other <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1184/reports/6858026.pdf">linguistic comparisons</a> of <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/stylometric-analysis-satoshi-nakamoto-294926cdf995">commonly used</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/05/who-is-the-real-satoshi-nakamoto-one-researcher-may-have-found-the-answer/?guccounter=1">words and phrases</a> have been made that inconclusively point to other candidates. On the forum, Nakamoto often uses a double space at the start of a sentence, while Todd does not. Both Back and Todd pepper in dashes to break up clauses in a single sentence — Nakamoto doesn’t. Could the stylistic differences be a cunning, intentional misdirection? No one knows. Ultimately, none of these tics add up to definitive proof.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many in the bitcoin world conjecture that Nakamoto disappeared because WikiLeaks — the site where Julian Assange published many leaked documents — appeared poised to start accepting <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerhuang/2019/04/26/how-bitcoin-and-wikileaks-saved-each-other/">donations in bitcoin</a>, which might lead to more attention on Nakamoto. In one of their <a href="http://gavinandresen.ninja/eleven-years-ago-today">last known communications</a>, Nakamoto wrote to bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, “I wish you wouldn’t keep talking about me as a mysterious shadowy figure, the press just turns that into a pirate currency angle.” In the last known email, sent in April 2011, Nakamoto claimed they were no longer involved with bitcoin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The fact is, what makes bitcoin such an interesting system is precisely the fact that the original creator doesn&#8217;t have control over bitcoin,” Todd said, adding that their identity is irrelevant. It’s clear Nakamoto never intends to out themselves — and, indeed, they seem to argue there’s no point. Bitcoin is now out of their hands. So how much does their identity matter?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hoback argues that it matters a lot due to how important bitcoin has become. “Bitcoin is already being baked into our financial system,” he told Vox, referring to its acceptance as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034838909/bitcoin-el-salvador-legal-tender-official-currency-cryptocurrency">legal tender</a> in some countries and the fact that it could now be included in <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/bitcoin-funds-set-new-precedent-for-crypto-401k-ira-investing">401(k)s</a>. Nakamoto potentially controls a significant portion of the total limited supply of bitcoin; if they one day decided to come forward and start moving (and spending) the coins in their possession, such an enormous sell-off could be destabilizing for the cryptocurrency. If they spend their riches, there’s also arguably a public interest in knowing where so much money is going, and whether it has any political impact.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Acknowledging the possibility that Nakamoto could be multiple people, Hoback continued, “This group is making themselves super rich while saying no one should look into Satoshi. Isn’t that a little suspicious?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you believe holding the powerful to account is important, then Nakamoto’s insistence on anonymity stands against the transparency that such accountability requires. It’s no secret that many of the world’s richest people have historically cleaved to remaining as private as possible, using <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/2024/3/13/24086102/billionaires-wealthy-tax-avoidance-loopholes">elaborate financial structures</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2023/1/4/23413342/us-tax-havens-billionaires-wealthy">tax havens</a> to avoid scrutiny of <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23604105/philanthropy-mackenzie-scott-elon-musk-billionaires-charity">what their money is funding</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then again, there’s no proof Nakamoto has spent any of their fortune. Their known bitcoin hoard is a rough value of net worth, not yet used for anything — and we know this because all bitcoin transactions are part of a public ledger. If they started cashing in their bitcoin stockpile, that could make it easier for people to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/untraceable-bitcoin-is-a-myth-11623860828">find their real-life identity</a>, which is an incentive for Nakamoto to leave that stash untouched. (It is curious, though, that in late September about <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/satoshi-era-wallets-move-16m-075536741.html?guccounter=1">$13 million worth of bitcoin</a> mined in the early days of the cryptocurrency suddenly moved.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps there’s a better question than whether it matters who Nakamoto is: How important is it that the inventor of bitcoin remains a mystery?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From the perspective of the cypherpunks, it’s crucial. There’s a financial motivation — the reveal of Nakamoto’s real identity could tank the price of bitcoin. But Nakamoto’s lasting anonymity is also an ideological resistance to government authority in an increasingly surveilled digital world. Many <a href="https://x.com/adam3us/status/1842503179130298492">key</a> <a href="https://x.com/lopp/status/1753475690174058979">figures</a> in the bitcoin community unequivocally express a desire for Nakamoto’s identity to stay a secret — according to Hoback, Todd seemed displeased that people had found Nakamoto’s million-plus bitcoin stash, and told him to leave Nakamoto alone. There’s also the potential danger someone could be in if others think they’re Nakamoto. In a comment to the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/has-bitcoins-elusive-creator-finally-been-unmasked">New Yorker</a>, Todd said Hoback had put his safety at risk by accusing him of being a multibillionaire, and that he would soon be doing “some unplanned travel.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Todd isn’t wrong that prior attempts to unmask Nakamoto have disturbed people’s personal lives — take the case of Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a former engineer and programmer in California who was the subject of a <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/2014/03/14/face-behind-bitcoin-247957.html">Newsweek report</a> claiming he was the bitcoin god. Dorian Nakamoto has categorically denied even knowing what cryptocurrencies are, and has said the accusation and public scrutiny caused a “great deal of confusion and stress” for him and his family. In response, Hoback told Vox that other people long suspected of being Nakamoto, like Nick Szabo and Adam Back, are fine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For his part, Todd noted Hoback also had a financial motivation — to sell his documentary. “I think that financial incentive is clouding his moral judgement here,” he told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Toward the end of the <em>Money Electric</em>, Todd says the hunt for bitcoin’s Nakamoto is yet another example of “journalists really missing the point.” The point, he elaborates, is “to make bitcoin the global currency.” But if that came to fruition — and it <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-ultimate-700k-portfolio-allocation">isn’t close to becoming reality</a> yet — then ironically, Hoback’s argument for hunting down the bitcoin mastermind would only become more compelling to both the general public and almost certainly to governments around the world. The surest way to protect Nakamoto’s anonymity seems to be for bitcoin to not become a widespread alternative threatening government-issued currencies — to not become too important.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The </em>Today, Explained<em> podcast is taking a deep dive into the major themes of the 2024 election through the lens of seven battleground states. We’ve heard from voters in </em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0a8ahdph7BGpx9d0ZjzU3q?si=b5fcd333949f4909"><em>Georgia</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qTFkzBeRxCT5sPluaxd7n?si=13da5fec1295486e"><em>Pennsylvania</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0d33827slG3WnJObyCr2C1?si=376ff7132c7f4f52"><em>Arizona</em></a><em>, and </em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1cxNjSdvROa1wGke9EstSJ?si=e9d49ab2703443ea"><em>Wisconsin</em></a><em> so far; this week we turn to </em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5GYFB15pwSNllF87AGX8i7?si=27f6737b426447a3"><em>North Carolina</em></a><em>, where a storm last month devastated the state — and some of its election infrastructure.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Officials in North Carolina are preparing for an election like no other in the wake of Hurricane Helene. The storm scrambled North Carolinians’ voting infrastructure — washing away absentee ballots, disrupting mail service, and destroying polling locations — and could impact what Election Day looks like in two weeks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The state is expected to be close — former President Donald Trump won by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/state/north-carolina">just 1.3 percentage points in 2020</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/378909/election-2024-polls-harris-trump-winning-odds">current polling averages</a> suggest an even tighter race this year — and all eyes are on the mountains, which received the brunt of the hurricane&#8217;s impact. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While some parts of life are getting back to normal after Hurricane Helene swept through last month —&nbsp;power returning, internet service restored — many people in the west of the state are still without potable water in their homes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With so many people displaced or managing repairs, experts have raised concerns about depressed voter turnout.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The question is going to be: If you&#8217;re having to avoid swallowing water while you shower, how important is voting going to be to you?” Steve Harrison, a political reporter at NPR affiliate station WFAE, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5GYFB15pwSNllF87AGX8i7?si=3d00e30d45b64b70">told</a> <em>Today, Explained</em> host Sean Rameswaram.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe loading="lazy" frameBorder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP6550148805" width="100%"></iframe>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an effort to ensure the election proceeds as close to normally as possible, local election officials <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/07/bipartisan-state-board-unanimously-approves-measures-help-wnc-voters">have been allowed</a> to move polling locations and adjust hours. The state has also updated rules for absentee voters, allowing them to return their completed ballots to counties other than their home county, as previously required, though the state <a href="https://www.wral.com/story/nc-elections-face-shifting-rules-uncertainty-heading-into-final-2024-stretch/21667522/">stopped short</a> of re-instituting a three-day grace period for ballots to be returned for counting. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even with the added flexibility, actually communicating the changes to voters in the affected areas remains challenging. “Information is hard to get, because the internet is down and cell service is down, and everything changes on a day-to-day basis,” Buncombe County resident Kaitlyn Leaf said. “Sometimes hour by hour.” (Leaf is married to a Vox Media employee, audio engineer Patrick Boyd.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, officials’ efforts to create more flexibility for voters seem to be paying off: The state set <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/news/press-releases/2024/10/18/north-carolina-sets-turnout-record-first-day-early-voting">a turnout record</a> on the first day of early voting, which began in all 100 counties on October 17, though it’s unclear how many of those votes were cast in the affected areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These voters could have an outsized impact on the outcome of the national election, according to Harrison’s <a href="https://www.wfae.org/politics/2024-10-07/helene-flooded-mostly-red-counties-will-that-impact-the-election">analysis</a>. Of the 15 counties that were most impacted by Helene, Biden won only two in 2020: Buncombe, home to the liberal city of Asheville, and Watauga, where Appalachian State University is located. The rest? Trump won by wide margins. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president-north-carolina.html">Polling</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/north-carolina/">averages</a> show the 2024 presidential race in North Carolina as a dead heat, which means any decrease in turnout in those counties could ultimately hurt the former president’s chances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If it&#8217;s incredibly close, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to hear the last of Helene,” Harrison told <em>Today, Explained</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Election Day worries in other battleground states, briefly explained&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">North Carolina isn’t the only state that could run into Election Day obstacles, though Hurricane Helene’s impact makes its situation unique. Extraordinarily thin margins and wrinkles in the vote-counting rules in other battleground states could <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/vote-counting-delays-election-states/index.html">delay the full results of the election</a> past November 5.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With polls showing several of the battleground states <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">neck and neck</a> between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, election officials are warning they may need to count a greater share of ballots before media organizations are able to reliably make their projections, resulting in a multiday process similar to 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many states are also dealing with last-minute attempts to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/16/nx-s1-5154148/alabama-noncitizen-voter-purge-lawsuit">purge voter rolls</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/373334/georgia-election-board-rule-changes-trump">change election rules</a>. But at least two states are likely to see delays because their election rules stayed the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, election officials are barred from processing mail ballots until 7 am on Election Day. In other states with mail-in ballots, workers may prepare ballots for counting earlier —&nbsp;verifying signatures, flattening the ballots — in order to streamline vote counting on Election Day. Wisconsin and Pennsylvania election workers’ later starts may result in delayed calls this year, particularly if the race comes down just a few thousand votes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both state legislatures considered updating their rules after the 2020 election, but conspiracy theories and partisan gridlock ultimately killed bills that would have done so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s a real frustration,” Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/22/politics/vote-counting-delays-election-states/index.html">told</a> CNN in September. “[The proposed legislation] does not benefit any candidate. It does not benefit any party. It only benefits the public in knowing results earlier and our election officials, who otherwise don’t have to work day and night.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As we saw in 2020, any delay between Election Day and the final results leaves ample room for conspiracy theories to take hold — something Trump is likely to take full advantage of. In 2020, Trump <a href="https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1324004491612618752">posted about</a> “surprise ballot dumps” in Milwaukee after a jump in Biden votes when the city reported all of its absentee ballots at the same time. (He <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-returns-wisconsin-false-claims-2020-election-rcna146092">still</a> falsely claims that he won Wisconsin in 2020.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">CNN political correspondent Sara Murray says voters ought to ignore the conspiracy theories in the event of a longer wait for results in 2024.“Just because this takes a couple of days doesn’t mean that there is some kind of mass-scale voter fraud going on,” she <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5GYFB15pwSNllF87AGX8i7?si=3d00e30d45b64b70">told</a><em> </em><em>Today, Explained</em>. “It doesn&#8217;t mean machines are flipping votes. It doesn&#8217;t mean people are throwing away ballots. It just means election workers are still counting the votes.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A rain-soaked street at dusk, pictured through the window of a coffee shop. String lights hang between old brick buildings, a church steeple in the distance. In the foreground, a candlelit table with mugs of coffee, tea, and … a corked glass jug of beige liquid? Next to a floating hunk of sourdough? And also the table is covered in water?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is the platonic ideal of “autumn,” according to <a href="https://x.com/fallaesthetic0/status/1838554530788581509">one photo that’s gone viral</a> both on X, where it’s been seen almost 12 million times, and Pinterest, where it’s the <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/914862420332827/">first picture</a> that comes up when you search “fall inspo.” At first glance, you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s a tiny street in Edinburgh or the part of Boston that looks like <em>Gilmore Girls</em>. But like so many other viral autumnal vibes photos this year, the image, with its nonsensical details and uncanny aura, appears to be AI-generated. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AI “autumn vibes” imagery makes up a ton of the most popular fall photos on Pinterest right now, from a <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/418834834116536388/">moody outdoor book display</a> on yet another rain-soaked street to a sunlit <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/14496030044746655/">farmers market</a> to several instances of coffee cups perched on tousled bedspreads. All of them appear normal until you zoom in and realize the books <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/9922061673553365/">don’t contain actual letters</a> and the pillows are actually made of <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/774124930061302/">bath mat material</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not just limited to Pinterest or “vibes”: AI-generated content is now infiltrating social media in ways that have a meaningful impact on people’s lives. Knitters and crocheters hoping to craft fall sweaters are being inundated with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CraftedByAI/">nonsensical AI patterns and inspo images</a> on Reddit. A <a href="https://austin.eater.com/2024/10/17/24272080/ethos-fake-ai-restaurant-austin-explained-faq">fake restaurant</a> has gained 75,000 followers on Instagram by claiming to be “No. 1 in Austin” and posting over-the-top seasonal food items like a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DA-6ul4ujt8/?hl=en">croissant shaped like Moo Deng</a>. Meanwhile, folks hoping to curl up with a cozy fantasy novel or a bedtime story for their kids are confronted with a library of <a href="https://maxread.substack.com/p/my-kindle-thinks-im-stupid-now">Chat GPT-generated nonsense</a> “written” by nonexistent authors on the Kindle bookstore, while their YouTube algorithms serve them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3VnmAIeetA">bot-generated fall ambiance videos</a>. Autumn, it seems, is being eaten by AI. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not everyone is — and please excuse the following pun — falling for it. When the fake cafe photo went viral on X, it caused a deluge of quote-tweets asking why the hell anyone needed to use AI when you could <a href="https://x.com/aetheene/status/1839615422041137182">just as easily post one</a> of the many actual photos taken in real cities that do, in fact, look like this. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The crux of the issue now is the sheer scale of it: Scammers and spammers can unleash a barrage of text and images with the click of a button.</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Colloquially, all this garbage is <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html">widely considered “slop,</a>” a term for the spammy AI-generated images, text, and videos that clog up internet platforms and make it more difficult and unpleasant than ever to be online. In reality, this moment of peak slop is the natural culmination of platforms that incentivize virality and engagement at all costs — no matter how low-quality the content happens to be. But the crux of the issue now is the sheer scale of it: Scammers and spammers can unleash a barrage of text and images with the click of a button, so searches for legitimate information or a casual scroll through social media require even more time and effort to bypass the junk. Misinformation about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/04/hurricane-helena-deepfakes-flooding-social-media-hurt-real-people/">crucial news events</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/sep/12/twitter-ai-bot-grok-election-misinformation">election coverage</a> is spreading on platforms. Academic and literary publications are <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/351041/ai-art-chatgpt-dall-e-sora-suno-human-creativity">being spammed with low-quality submissions</a>, making it harder to suss out genuine creative or scholarly work. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, there are more urgent concerns regarding the rise of generative AI: its <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising">enormous energy consumption</a>, for one, or the rampant creation of <a href="https://www.vox.com/24145522/ai-deepfake-apps-teens-ban-laws">deepfake porn used to harass and abuse women</a>. Considering all that, it’s easy to look at cute AI-generated fall pictures on Pinterest as a relative non-issue, a side effect of a technology that could (arguably) <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/4/28/23702644/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-technology">greatly benefit humanity</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-21-at-2.54.49%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=8.4294117647059,0,83.141176470588,100" alt="Pinterest screenshot showing various autumnal scenes including fall foliage, coffee shops, farmers markets, and bookstores." title="Pinterest screenshot showing various autumnal scenes including fall foliage, coffee shops, farmers markets, and bookstores." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A screenshot of a Pinterest search for “autumn vibes.” At least three of these images appear to be AI-generated. | Pinterest" data-portal-copyright="Pinterest" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But as Jason Koebler, co-founder of the tech publication <a href="https://www.404media.co/">404 Media</a> explains, these images normalize AI slop and desensitize our ability to discern what’s real and what’s fake. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The clogging of feeds and of search results is not just a side effect, but a main effect of all of this,” he told me. “It’s harder for a journalist writing an article to break through, or an artist painting a picture, or a musician making a song when they’re competing with not just a bunch of other humans making stuff, but humans who are using this automatic creation machine to make things at a scale that is impossible otherwise.” The problem is so bad that tools used to track the human usage of certain words online are <a href="https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md">no longer effective</a> due to the prevalence of large-language models. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AI slop typically comes from people trying to make money by going viral on social media. Platforms like Facebook, Instagram, X, and TikTok all have programs that pay creators based on how much engagement their content receives, and AI makes it easier than ever to produce and test that content. That’s led to an entire cottage industry of people all over the world who teach paid courses on how to produce highly engaging AI slop, sharing information on the best prompts to generate the most attention-getting posts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Facebook, AI posters <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/">say they make</a> around $100 per 1,000 likes, and some TikTokers are <a href="https://theconversation.com/side-job-self-employed-high-paid-behind-the-ai-slop-flooding-tiktok-and-facebook-237638">making $5,000 per month</a> at their side hustles. It’s a decent amount for anyone but especially lucrative in countries where many AI content hustlers are based, such as India, Vietnam, and the Philippines. One Kenya-based creator <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html">told New York magazine</a> that his process involves asking ChatGPT something like, “WRITE ME 10 PROMPT picture OF JESUS WHICH WILLING BRING HIGH ENGAGEMENT ON FACEBOOK” and then plugging those prompts into an image generator like Leonardo.ai and Midjourney.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather than being worried about their platforms being overrun with low-quality engagement bait, Meta and X seem unconcerned and even supportive of it. “There seems to be very little interest from any platform in taking action about this stuff,” Koebler says. “They are actively, in some cases, generating it themselves, and being like, ‘Look how cool this technology is!’” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both Meta and X have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/technology/meta-profit-stock-ai.html">invested heavily</a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-twitter-investment-generative-ai-project-2023-4?op=1">in AI</a>, offering tools for users to add to the ever-increasing deluge of slop on their platforms. Meta’s official account <a href="https://www.threads.net/@meta/post/DA_mM0Ey1qC">even posted an AI photo</a> of the northern lights over San Francisco on Threads — its top reply is a NASA engineer explaining why images like this spread false information and “muddy the waters of reality.”</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AI slop will continue to exist as long as people are finding ways to make money from it, just like any practice on social media, from the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22841564/internet-trends-tiktok-sea-shanties-bama-rush">merely irksome</a> to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/357645/misinformation-debunking-health-tiktok-youtube-instagram-weird-health-trick-hack">actually dangerous</a>. Koebler guesses that AI spam got so popular because some of the platforms cracked down on content stolen from real creators, making AI the second-easiest option for spammers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are just posting whatever they&#8217;re getting out of these AI generator machines, regardless of the level of quality,” he says, “because of the ways that virality and social media algorithms work, even if you have the world&#8217;s greatest piece of content, it might not go viral, whereas something that is not very good might, just because you won the luck of the draw.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a particular irony with AI-generated images of fall vibes, considering <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/what-happened-to-autumn-scientists-point-to-climate-change-202933722.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABdPsETAliFu_D60FnVswL1bKSbmLv-ogtFDYmC7b5k3V8QRJJ8aPiTaSixYEYuz0KW8wDJAC7jMKnh8uB1w_OJLPIQoOQwFfTjWpVW_KBGBBdHDMiutQhh_JVYfw8yZpbnYx-SE2j1IUxr9oWnJihEnzxiV5dViPLGSUMM-yJi-">fall is disappearing</a> from many parts of the US and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/07/12/g-s1-9545/ai-brings-soaring-emissions-for-google-and-microsoft-a-major-contributor-to-climate-change">AI emissions have become a major contributor</a> to climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it’s not as if the internet is starving for aesthetically pleasing fall inspo: Every September, social media is flooded with images of pumpkin-strewn stoops, cozy blankets on comfy sofas, or small towns covered in yellow and orange leaves. For the past few years, we’ve christened these mini-moments online with names: <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22697069/meg-ryan-fall-tiktok-style-christian-girl-autumn">Meg Ryan fall</a>, which had its own outfit and playlist recommendations<em>,</em> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/8/14/20804030/christian-girl-autumn-meme-hot-girl-summer-explained">Christian girl autumn</a>, where people unleashed their inner white woman by wearing wide-brimmed hats and knee-high boots to grab <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/8/29/17791082/pumpkin-spice-latte-starbucks-backlash-explained">pumpkin spice lattes</a>. (This year, <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/brooding-fall-vibes-social-media-evolution.html">it seems like</a> the Gilmores’ fictional Connecticut town of Stars Hollow is providing much of the inspiration.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s all very cutesy and wholesome, but even this type of human-made content is increasingly little more than a plot to get viewers to click on affiliate links to Amazon storefronts or ultra-cheap <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/358886/tiktok-shop-ads-products-annoying">TikTok Shop junk</a>. In this way, they’re not all that dissimilar from AI slop: Platforms are encouraging their users to be professional salespeople, whether they’re hawking unethically made clothing and home goods or spamming audiences with AI-generated inspo photos. Both are low-quality, quick-to-produce types of content that drive engagement and, therefore, revenue, even when regular users say they hate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the joy in scrolling through fall photos, after all, is knowing that these places exist and you could theoretically visit them, that the world fundamentally changes in autumn, and that there’s only a small window of time to marvel at how beautiful it all is. An AI-generated image represents the precise opposite: It’s just one of the infinite possible arrangements of pixels for machines to keep churning out indefinitely. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats are currently focused on the fight against Donald Trump. But quietly, factions within the party are preparing contingency plans for a different battle: the one over how to interpret a Kamala Harris loss.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html">Polls of the 2024 election show</a> the closest presidential race in modern memory. For Harris, defeat is roughly as likely as victory. The former outcome is sure to trigger a fierce intra-Democratic debate over what the party should learn from losing the White House (twice) to an unpopular demagogue.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Already, moderates in the party are seeding the narrative that Harris was doomed by the Biden administration’s excessive <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/kamala-harris-donald-trump-television-ad-trans-prisoners-activists.html">deference to left-wing interest groups</a> and <a href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/why-biden-lost">aversion to orthodox economics</a>. Some progressives suggest that Harris may be undone by her <a href="https://x.com/matthewstoller/status/1841940145882194018">ties to big business</a>, failure to articulate a “<a href="https://x.com/EmmaVigeland/status/1844371453388742896">vision for the country</a>,” and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/oct/14/kamala-harris-israel-gaza">complicity in Israeli atrocities in Gaza</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s impossible to say with absolute certainty which — if any — of these theories would become conventional wisdom in the event of a second Trump victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Often, when a party suffers an electoral rebuke, the faction that led it into the wilderness loses influence within the coalition. After Hillary Clinton’s loss in 2016, the Democratic Party became more progressive, ceding influence to some of her left-wing critics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet no wing of the Democratic Party can claim full ownership of either the Biden presidency or Harris campaign. On the one hand, Joe Biden was the moderate candidate in the 2020 primary. And Harris is now <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/15/2024/no-matter-who-wins-the-country-is-moving-to-the-right">running to the right</a> of Biden 2020, touting a more modest fiscal agenda than the president’s, championing a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/27/politics/harris-southern-border-arizona/index.html">conservative border security bill,</a> promising to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/11/us/politics/harris-bipartisan-council-of-advisers.html">appoint a bipartisan council of advisers</a>, and pledging to solicit input <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/kamala-harris-fox-news-interview-biden-1236180336/">from “the business sector” while in office</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, progressives wielded <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics">tremendous influence</a> over economic policy in the Biden White House. And Harris is only five years removed from campaigning as a <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/07/kamala-harriss-medicare-for-all-plan-makes-no-sense.html">proponent of Medicare-for-all</a> and the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/harris-climate-energy-policy-domestic-oil-drilling/">Green New Deal</a> — issue positions that Trump’s team has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZWoEklbLA">relentlessly highlighted</a>. What’s more, the fact that Harris secured the Democratic nomination without competing in a primary makes the question of who within the party owns her success or failure even more ambiguous.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All this said, I suspect anyone who believes a <a href="https://x.com/anthonyzenkus/status/1847826848220172407">Harris defeat would strengthen the party’s progressive wing</a> is kidding themselves. On the contrary, I think Trump’s election would push the Democrats rightward or at least consolidate the moderate turn that the party has already taken.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From my perspective, this would not be a happy development. Under Biden, the Democratic Party’s positioning on many issues has been to the right of my own preferences. I believe the United States would be best served by a more generous social welfare state, higher levels of immigration, and a foreign policy that shows less tolerance for the human rights violations of US allies. But the political case for some degree of moderation in the wake of a Harris loss will be plausible. And I believe that case will win out for three reasons:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, the unusual conditions that led Democrats to move left after their first loss to Trump no longer hold.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, one of progressives’ perennial arguments against the political necessity of moderation — that Democrats can mobilize low-propensity young and nonwhite voters through bold progressivism — has grown less credible over the past eight years.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, a Trump victory would almost certainly lead to <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/18/2024/the-5-trillion-dollar-issue-neither-campaign-wants-to-talk-about-trumps-expiring-tax-cuts">a full extension of his 2017 tax cuts</a> — and, if the Republican gets his way, new reductions in corporations’ tax liabilities. This would swell the federal deficit, thereby rendering moderate Democrats more averse to ambitious new social welfare spending, such as that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/">proposed by Biden</a> during his first year in office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is not to say that a Harris loss would cause Democrats to re-embrace the across-the-board centrism of Bill Clinton’s second term. Rather, Democrats would likely remain staunchly progressive in areas where left-wing positioning has little political cost.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But losing a second election to an undisciplined reactionary probably won’t convince Democrats that Biden and Harris were insufficiently left-wing on immigration, criminal justice, or fiscal policy. A second Trump victory would therefore probably mean not only a more conservative federal government, but also, in all likelihood, a more moderate Democratic Party.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">We’re not in 2017 anymore</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The last time Democrats lost to Trump, they proceeded to move left: Bernie Sanders’s Medicare-for-all bill <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/09/sanderss-bill-gets-u-s-zero-percent-closer-to-single-payer.html">gained sponsors in Congress</a>, nearly every Democrat with presidential ambitions <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/most-democrats-promise-to-decriminalize-border-crossings-during-2020-debate">embraced more progressive issue positions</a>, and the party ultimately nominated a candidate with a <a href="https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/campaigns/article234890482.html">more left-wing platform</a> than Hillary Clinton’s four years earlier.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But should Harris lose in November, this history is unlikely to repeat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Three factors enabled the Democrats’ progressive pivot after 2016. First, Trump’s victory and Sanders’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/01/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-poll/index.html">strong general election poll numbers</a> briefly <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/dems-can-abandon-the-center-because-the-center-doesnt-exist.html">threw conventional political wisdom into doubt</a>. Second, Sanders’s surprising strength in the 2016 primary led many Democratic presidential hopefuls to court his constituency. And third, the party knew it would be running against an exceptionally unpopular Republican in 2020.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of these conditions would hold following a Harris loss.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2016, most mainstream commentators understood Trump as an extremist and expected him to lose partly for that reason. After all, the right-wing demagogue praised <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-trump-campaign-protests-20160313-story.html">political violence</a>, called for <a href="https://www.npr.org/2015/12/07/458836388/trump-calls-for-total-and-complete-shutdown-of-muslims-entering-u-s">ethnic discrimination</a>, and promised to<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/02/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-imprisoned/index.html"> imprison his presidential rival</a>. The fact that Trump nevertheless won the presidency naturally invited suspicions that the realm of politically tenable positions was wider than previously thought. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This sense was reinforced by Sanders’s apparent popularity. During the 2016 campaign, polls <a href="https://fair.org/home/polls-showed-sanders-had-a-better-shot-of-beating-trump-but-pundits-told-you-to-ignore-them/">frequently showed</a> him performing better against Trump than Clinton did. Taken together, Trump and Sanders’s apparent electability suggested that the benefits of <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2783/democrats-need-to-move-farther-left">moderation</a> may have been greatly exaggerated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the intervening years, however, conventional political wisdom regained credibility. Democratic politicos came to appreciate that swing voters did not see Trump the same way they did: Voters saw him in 2016 <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/7/11/15941846/trump-moderate-republican">as the most “moderate” Republican nominee</a> since 1972. This perception wasn’t entirely baseless.&nbsp;Although Trump adopted some far-right positions, he also pulled his party to the left on <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/10/06/496067982/the-issues-hillary-clinton-and-donald-trump-on-social-security-and-medicare">entitlement spending</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/donald-trump-trade-tpp-231212'">trade</a>. At various points in his 2016 campaign, he also offered rhetorical support for center-left positions on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/02/25/politics/donald-trump-defends-planned-parenthood-republican-debate/index.html">Planned Parenthood</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/trump-transgender-bathrooms-222257">LGBTQ rights</a>, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/12/16/10296032/donald-trump-gop-debate-iraq-war">foreign policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Sanders’s poll numbers softened. By 2020, his favorability rating <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/bernie_sanders_favorableunfavorable-6676.html">was underwater</a>, with non-college-educated white voters disapproving of him by <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/why-americans-dont-vote-their-class-bernie-sanders-marxist-electoral-theory.html">more than 25 points</a> in some polls. Sanders remained more popular and electorally competitive than socialists were traditionally presumed to be. This likely reflected the popular appeal of many progressive positions, including a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/04/22/most-americans-support-a-15-federal-minimum-wage/">$15 minimum wage</a> and support for <a href="https://thehill.com/business/4869155-poll-approval-labor-unions/">organized labor</a>. Nevertheless, in many high-quality polls in 2020, Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/upshot/trump-biden-warren-polls.html">performed better</a> against Trump than Sanders did.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second condition that led Democrats to move left after 2016 was the apparent strength of progressives in presidential primaries. Despite Hillary Clinton’s enormous edge in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/">party support</a>, Sanders still managed to make the 2016 primary highly competitive. In a more open race, it stood to reason that a progressive in Sanders’s mold might have the inside track to the nomination. This led Democratic presidential hopefuls to bid against each other for the left’s support. Ultimately, that progressive fervor influenced even the race’s moderate, Joe Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Sanders and Elizabeth Warren both put up underwhelming performances in the 2020 primary. Once the party’s moderates unified behind Biden, he won easily. The race’s ultimate lesson was that a majority of Democratic primary voters <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-rode-perception-electability-victory-2020-now-may-undoing-rcna161133">care more about perceived electability</a> than ideological purity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Further, if Harris loses — after Trump spent months assailing her for positions she took in 2020 — Democrats will take a second lesson from that primary: Getting into bidding wars for progressive support is electorally damaging. Put these two takeaways together, and the Democrats’ 2028 field following a Harris loss is likely to be more moderate than its 2020 one. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, after 2016, Democrats knew they would be running against an exceptionally <a href="https://www.vox.com/a/trump-tax">unpopular and undisciplined</a> Republican candidate four years later. This made it possible for the party to indulge its activists and advocacy groups while remaining highly competitive in the polls.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Assuming a second Trump presidency doesn’t end the republic, Democrats would face a non-Trump Republican in 2028 for the first time in more than a decade. One shouldn’t put it past conservatives to find an even more repellent standard-bearer, but odds are a post-Trump GOP nominee would be more capable of adhering to a message and avoiding personal scandal than the party’s current leader. And that could force Democrats to exercise greater ideological discipline.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Juicing turnout through bold progressivism is no longer a plausible alternative to placating swing voters</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of a Harris loss, progressives would also lack one weapon they had long possessed in intra-party skirmishes over strategy: a halfway plausible theory of how Democrats can make moderation unnecessary by mobilizing their base.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea that Democrats could forgo winning over skeptical swing voters by increasing turnout was long central to progressive political thinking. And it’s not hard to see why: An American who would consider voting Republican, by definition, is one who does not share the progressive movement’s worldview. Such a person might have progressive views on some issues (swing voters <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/7/8/5878293/lets-stop-using-the-word-moderate">often have ideologically heterodox views</a>), but they are unlikely to believe the Democratic Party is insufficiently aligned with the left on all major issues. To the contrary, according to New York Times polling, swing voters are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/04/briefing/who-the-swing-voters-are.html">more likely to identify as conservative than liberal</a>. And this is liable to be even more true of those nonpartisan voters who ultimately do cast a ballot for the GOP nominee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, if Democratic officials conclude that their party must win over some voters who backed Republicans in the last election, then those officials are liable to moderate ideologically, at least on some issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the wake of past defeats, progressives tried to dissuade Democrats from reaching that conclusion by offering an alternative path to a new electoral majority: Instead of placating Republican-curious voters, Democrats could <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/democratic-leadership-base">mobilize young and nonwhite voters</a> who already <a href="https://prospect.org/civil-rights/democrats-must-mobilize-america-s-largest-political-party-nonvoters/">favored their party</a> but hadn’t previously shown up at the polls. Achieving the latter task required championing a bold vision for progressive change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This pitch always had its flaws. For one, persuading a Republican-leaning voter is twice as valuable as turning out a Democrat: Doing the former not only adds a vote to your party’s column, it subtracts one from your opponent’s tally. For another, evidence that nonvoting people of color were uniformly progressive <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/09/28/can-trump-win-black-votes-what-we-know-from-5-decades-of-black-voting-data/">has never been especially strong</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the idea that mobilization could serve as a substitute for moderation had some plausibility in the 2010s. In the Obama era, Democrats thrived in high-turnout presidential elections while struggling in low-turnout midterms. The demographic groups with the lowest turnout rates — including young and Hispanic voters — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/opinion/voter-turnout-democrats-republicans.html">were overwhelmingly Democratic</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But two developments have weakened this case in recent years. First, young and nonwhite Americans have become <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/24125496/young-voters-trump-biden-polling">less reliably Democratic</a>, according to the polls. Second, it’s become clear that the subset of young and nonwhite Americans with a low propensity to vote isn’t especially left-wing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In polls of the 2024 race, Democrats’ margin with<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/18/upshot/polls-trump-harris-young-men.html"> young voters has fallen sharply</a>. In some surveys, Trump has opened up a roughly 20-point lead with young men, and he has also made <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/13/upshot/trump-black-hispanic-voters-harris.html">substantial gains with Black and Hispanic voters</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More importantly, it’s become apparent that low-propensity young and nonwhite voters — the typical targets for a progressive mobilization strategy — are particularly open to the Republican message and not particularly liberal.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nate Cohn of the New York Times first flagged this reality in 2019. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/upshot/nonvoters-2020-presidential-election.html">a study</a> of battleground state nonvoters, Cohn found that Biden’s margin over Trump with nonvoting Black respondents was 44 points smaller than his margin with Black voters who turned out in both 2016 and 2018.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cohn’s analysis also found that young nonvoters who leaned Democratic had more conservative opinions on immigration, health care, and gender than young Democrats who showed up for elections. All in all, Cohn found that nonvoters’ views didn’t differ substantially from those of the electorate at large.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Subsequent polling and election results have lent credence to these findings. In the Biden era, Democrats have performed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/15/upshot/election-democrats-republicans-turnout-trump.html">better in low-turnout special elections</a> than relatively high-turnout presidential and midterm elections. And polls have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/30/upshot/biden-voters-midterms-2024.html">consistently found</a> Trump <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/harris-trump-election-10-16-2024/card/to-vote-or-not-to-vote-a-question-that-will-decide-the-election-pBzSqRJKvBybUWiS6qfe">performing better</a> with low-propensity voters than reliable ones, a pattern that holds within the nonwhite and young subsets of the electorate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t mean Democrats have nothing to gain from mobilizing low-propensity voters who lean left. Even if nonvoting Black Americans are less Democratic than Black Americans in general, they’re still majority Democratic. To the extent the party can target its supporters — without accidentally mobilizing conservative voters — turnout operations can aid Democratic candidates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the fact that nonvoters aren’t overwhelmingly Democratic and that nonvoting Democrats aren’t especially progressive makes it harder to argue that mobilization can serve as a substitute for winning over swing voters, or that moderating is antithetical to increasing Democratic turnout.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For these reasons, progressives would likely have a harder time preventing Democrats from moderating, at least on some issues, after a 2024 defeat than they did after Clinton’s loss in 2016.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Trump’s tax cuts would likely constrain future Democrats’ fiscal ambitions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s Democratic Party is already less fiscally ambitious than Biden’s was when he took office.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Democratic nominee still supports a wide <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans">range of new social programs</a>, from increased funding for long-term care to universal pre-kindergarten to family and medical leave. But Harris is nevertheless proposing fewer progressive economic initiatives than <a href="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/whats-president-bidens-american-families-plan">Biden did</a> upon taking office and has <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/15/2024/no-matter-who-wins-the-country-is-moving-to-the-right">dropped the public health insurance option</a> that he campaigned on in 2020. The most expensive item on Harris’s fiscal agenda is the extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for households earning less than $400,000 (Harris would offset some of these costs with tax increases on corporations and high earners).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Trump wins, it’s likely that the next Democratic president’s economic ambitions would be even more modest than Harris’s are today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Should Trump win the presidency, Republicans will have an excellent shot of controlling both the House and Senate. In that scenario, the party would likely enact the bulk of Trump’s proposed tax cuts, adding as <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans">much as $7.5 trillion to the deficit</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if Trump only manages to increase the deficit by a fraction of this sum, it would likely constrain moderate Democrats’ appetite for new social spending the next time the party takes power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Already in 2021, a significantly lower national debt total <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-manchin-says-hes-concerned-about-inflation-and-national-debt-2021-7">rendered Sen. Joe Manchin unwilling</a> to endorse more than a sliver of Biden’s program. Since then, following the post-pandemic spike in inflation and interest rates, Democratic wonks have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/04/business/national-debt.html">grown significantly</a> more <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/367278/us-national-debt-gdp-government-inflation-solutions-recession">concerned about America’s long-term fiscal trajectory</a>. As we get closer to 2032 — when, according to projections, Social Security will <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF10522.pdf">cease taking</a> in enough revenue to cover its benefits — anxieties about how the government will sustain its existing commitments<strong> </strong>will increase.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The easiest way for Congress to cover Social Security’s shortfall in 2033 would be to pay for the program’s unfunded benefits with general revenue. But this would cost <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/IF10522.pdf">$440.1 billion that year</a>, according to the Congressional Research Service, with the sum increasing steadily over time. To put that in context, merely sustaining Social Security’s existing benefits would cost more than all of Harris’s current proposals for expanding social welfare combined, according to the <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/fiscal-impact-harris-and-trump-campaign-plans">Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget</a>’s score of the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By itself, Social Security’s trajectory is enough to threaten Democrats’ fiscal ambitions. Add in another round of deficit-swelling tax cuts, and Biden’s Build Back Better agenda may come to seem as politically moribund in 2029 as Sanders’s health care plans do today.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Democrats aren’t going to party like it’s 1999 </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are three caveats to this analysis. The first is that anticipating how American politics will change over four years is not easy, as any pundit who followed both the 2012 and 2016 elections can tell you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second is that, should Harris lose, there would probably be tight limits to the Democrats’ moderation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike during Bill Clinton’s tenure, the Democratic Party no longer has the remnants of a center-right Southern wing. And unlike during much of the 20th century, socially conservative <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1980/01/11/george-meany-85-giant-of-us-labor-movement/41218613-522b-4199-9066-21a4aa911c71/">union heads</a> and <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-04-09-op-1581-story.html">urban machines</a> have no clout in blue America.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather, the Democratic coalition is more <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/467888/democrats-identification-liberal-new-high.aspx">uniformly liberal</a> than at any point in its history, and the same can be said of the party’s major advocacy groups. The contemporary leadership of the AFL-CIO is progressive on both economic and social issues, having forfeited the organization&#8217;s historic opposition to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/02/05/171175054/how-the-labor-movement-did-a-180-on-immigration">immigration in 2000</a>. Meanwhile, progressive foundations, think tanks, and nonprofits have extraordinary influence in the party, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/377170/kamala-harris-economic-policy-new-progressive-economics">effectively crafting</a> much of Biden’s domestic agenda for him. And by most accounts, the rising generation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/06/biden-administration-staff-gaza-policy-protest">Democratic staffers</a> is quite left-wing, their progressive impulses reinforced and sharpened by social media’s <a href="https://online.utpb.edu/about-us/articles/psychology/lost-in-the-crowd-the-phenomenon-of-group-polarization#:~:text=What%20Is%20Group%20Polarization%3F,extreme%20as%20they're%20discussed.">tendency toward group polarization</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The personal liberalism of Democratic elites will act as a check on any rightward pivot. Where there is no apparent political cost to upholding progressive principles, Democrats are likely to retain their current positioning or perhaps even move left. This category of issues would include abortion rights, minimum wage hikes, and pro-labor policies, among other things.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The third caveat is that this is not intended as a case for fatalism. I think Americans have a strong interest in higher levels of legal immigration and a more expansive welfare state. Neither Social Security’s impending shortfall nor another round of tax cuts will make it impossible for Democrats to create ambitious new social welfare programs. The party could simply enact large tax increases if it found the political will.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Progressives should try to forge that will by persuading the public of their views and discouraging Democrats from giving unnecessary ground. The ideological trajectory of America and the Democratic Party is not fixed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But should Harris lose, the path of least resistance will cut to the right.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and campaign surrogate for former President Donald Trump, recently announced a plan to give away $1 million each day until November 5 to a randomly chosen person who’s signed a petition from his political action committee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To win the money, the signee must be a registered swing state voter — and that criterion has raised concerns that Musk may be in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2023-title52/pdf/USCODE-2023-title52-subtitleI-chap103-sec10307.pdf">violation of a federal law</a> that makes it illegal to pay people (or offer them an incentive) to either register to vote or cast a ballot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think there&#8217;s a strong argument that there&#8217;s potential criminal liability here, so at the very least [the Department of Justice] should be investigating and should be warning people not to be doing this,” <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=146397">Richard Hasen</a>, director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA Law School, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The program works like this: Registered voters in Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, or Wisconsin — all swing states that could go for either Vice President Kamala Harris or Trump come Election Day — can sign the <a href="https://petition.theamericapac.org/">petition</a>, which claims to be a “Petition in Favor of Free Speech and the Right to Bear Arms” until Monday, October 21, <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx">which happens to be the voter registration deadline in Pennsylvania</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The petition is being circulated by Musk’s America PAC, which has taken over much of Trump’s ground operation in <a href="https://wapo.st/4fw1Tij">key swing states</a>. Musk has made Pennsylvania a particular focus of his personal outreach, hosting events there, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pro-trump-group-funded-by-musk-struggles-with-outreach-targets-inflation-2024-10-18/">including one on Sunday</a> where he handed a woman in a Trump-Vance shirt a giant $1 million check.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the petition does not require signers to be registered Republicans, the focus on the First and Second Amendments appeals to potential Trump voters who fear Democrats will take away their gun rights and who subscribe to Musk’s idea of “<a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/elon-musk-sues-critics-silence-so-much-free-speech">free speech</a>.” The net effect, then, is that Musk is promising $1 million a day to a program aimed at getting pro-Trump voters registered in swing states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because his contest is only open to registered voters, there may be a case for it to be understood as an illegal financial incentive to get people to register to vote. One issue Musk faces, said <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/team/david-becker/">David Becker</a>, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, is that what constitutes payment for voting-related activity has been broadly interpreted in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This could involve anything of value,” Becker said. The law “has been applied to things like <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/election_law_blogger_responsible_for_free_ben_jerrys">Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s offering everyone who has an ‘I Voted’ sticker an ice cream cone on Election Day</a>. They received a cease-and-desist letter and changed [the promotion to give] everyone a free ice cream cone on Election Day.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is some ambiguity in Musk’s promotion, compared to what Ben &amp; Jerry’s offered, however. The uncertainty arises from the fact that Musk’s PAC is asking people to sign a petition for the chance to win $1 million, not explicitly rewarding them for registering to vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/about/leadership/daniel-i-weiner">Daniel Weiner</a>, director of the Brennan Center’s Elections &amp; Government Program, told Vox that the issue at hand really comes down to whether entering a specific group of people in a lottery if they sign a petition counts as paying people to register to vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s certainly an argument that it is, [but] I think&nbsp;it&#8217;s hard to know for sure how to predict how this would play out in court,” Weiner said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the contest “concerning,” and said it was “something that law enforcement could take a look at” in an appearance on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/pennsylvania-gov-shapiro-law-enforcement-take-look-elon-musk-voter-pay-rcna176279">NBC’s <em>Meet the Press </em>on Sunday</a>. Thus far, the federal government hasn’t announced any investigation into the contest.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If indeed the Justice Department decided to pursue Musk, it would first send a cease-and-desist letter —&nbsp;just like the one Ben &amp; Jerry’s received back in 2008. From there, he would have to decide how to respond; the penalty for breaking the law is $10,000 or a maximum of five years in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if the DOJ decides to go after Musk for this —&nbsp;and there is no guarantee that it will —&nbsp;the issue likely won’t be resolved before November 5, in part to avoid any perception on the part of the federal government that the DOJ is meddling in the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are important norms around initiating investigations and legal proceedings in the run-up to an election. Otherwise, they can potentially launch an investigation after the election, and whether they will is something that&#8217;s difficult to predict,” Weiner said. “I think that this is something whose legality will not be resolved before the election.”</p>

And while Trump’s polling has improved slightly in the past few weeks, it hasn’t been enough to give him a clear edge. At least not yet.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On average, Trump holds a small edge, generally between 1 and 2 points, in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina. To win the presidency, though, he will need to breach the “blue wall” by winning one of Michigan, Pennsylvania, or Wisconsin. As of midday Monday, those states are still, on average, about tied.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There hasn’t been a ton of high-quality swing-state polling in recent weeks, and the best-regarded pollsters will likely all release new numbers closer to the end of the campaign. Once they do, we could get a better sense of where the race stands.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If polling averages continue to show an extremely close race after a final infusion of high-quality polls, it will only heighten the uncertainty about what will happen. Polling errors — where one candidate or party is systematically underestimated — of the magnitude of a few points are common.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The polls could be underestimating Trump again, as they did in swing states in 2016 and 2020. Alternatively, perhaps pollsters have corrected for their previous bias — or even overcorrected, risking an error that underestimates Harris. We simply won’t know until the votes are counted.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What the polls show in the swing states</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To recap: There are <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/378112/battleground-states-election-2024-trump-harris">seven swing states </a>that will very likely determine the outcome of the election (with every other state expected to go solidly for either Trump or Harris). Listed in order of electoral votes, they are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes)</li>



<li>North Carolina and Georgia (16 electoral votes each)</li>



<li>Michigan (15 electoral votes)</li>



<li>Arizona (11 electoral votes)</li>



<li>Wisconsin (10 electoral votes)</li>



<li>Nevada (6 electoral votes)</li>
</ul>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-polls-swing-states-1971095" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-kamala-harris-polls-swing-states-1971095">Harris can pick up 44 electoral votes</a> in these swing states, she’ll win the presidency. Trump would need 51 electoral votes from these same states to win. The polls say these swing states are — brace yourself — very close!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Nevada, and North Carolina all are almost exactly tied in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/polls-president.html">New York Times’s polling averages</a>, which show Trump up in Georgia by 1 and Arizona by 2. <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model">Nate Silver’s polling averages</a> have similar results.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a slightly more rosy story for Harris in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/presidential-polling-averages/">Washington Post’s averages</a>, which show her up by 2 in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. On the other hand, the <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/latest-polls">RealClearPolitics averages</a> show Trump leading by 2 points or less in all the swing states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But these differences are hair-splitting. None of these results are lopsided enough to instill any real confidence about which way the outcome will go.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vibes aren’t worth much either</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The vibes, on the other hand, point more clearly in one direction: Among Democrats, there’s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-are-nervous-kamala-harris-may-ok-rcna175257">been</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/09/politics/democratic-anxiety-kamala-harris-2024-election/index.html">increasing</a> <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/10/19/pennsylvania-election-anxiety-democrats-republicans-00184453">trepidation</a> about Harris’s chances, while Republicans sound quite confident in Trump’s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the pre-election vibes would have told you that the GOP was headed for a landslide victory in 2022, that Biden was going to win overwhelmingly (rather than very narrowly) in 2020, and that Trump had no chance of winning in 2016. These sorts of intangible hunches and guesses just aren’t worth much.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some point to purported clues about the outcome in non-polling metrics, like early voting numbers or prediction markets. But early voting numbers are a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/10/25/early-voting-data-bad-predicting-midterms/">notoriously bad indicator</a> of what will happen on Election Day. Prediction markets generally reflect conventional wisdom — and this year in particular, they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-election-odds-polymarket-whale-kamala-harris-polls-betting-markets-2024-10">may be skewed</a> by a few big-betting Trump fans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once we know the result, hindsight will be 20/20. We can all look back for the clues that were purportedly hidden in plain sight, as we tell ourselves stories about how the outcome was fated all along. For now, though, the race is simply too close to call.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of neuroscience research, the mouse reigns supreme: <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-many-mice-and-rats-are-used-us-labs-controversial-study-says-more-100-million">in the US alone, tens of millions of mice</a> are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">studied</a> as a proxy for the human brain in labs. They’re small, they breed quickly, and they’re relatively easy to genetically manipulate, making mice ubiquitous in biomedical science. When studying something fundamental to biology, like how individual cells work, the leap from mouse to human doesn’t feel egregious. But when mice are used to study distinctly human conditions like autism, the parallels start to break down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fifteen years ago, researchers <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/mouse-models-for-autism-debut/">introduced the first two mouse models of autism</a>, each carrying a genetic mutation linked to autism in humans. They claimed that these mice behaved like autistic humans, unusually preferring solitude over meeting new mice, and squeaking only around half as often as their non-autistic littermates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their results made major waves, inspiring researchers to experiment with other autism-related genes. Since the late 2000s, neuroscientists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9189007/">have bred over 20 types of mouse models</a> with motor problems, sensory sensitivities, and repetitive behaviors. These each capture some hallmark of human autism — provided you buy that a mouse burying marbles is the same as, for example, an autistic child insisting on eating the same food every day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a freshly minted PhD working at the National Institute of Mental Health in the late 2000s, Jill Silverman <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/why-studying-autism-in-mice-may-be-doomed-to-fail/">ran experiments</a> on mice missing part of their <a href="https://gene.sfari.org/database/human-gene/SHANK3">SHANK3<em> </em>gene</a>, a mutation found in about 1 in 100 autistic people. These SHANK3 mice seemed to show “autistic-like behaviors” like social discomfort and compulsive grooming, similar to the repetitive body movements, or <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/what-you-need-to-know-about-stimming-and-autism">stimming</a>, seen in some humans with autism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silverman, now a principal investigator at the <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/mind-institute/">UC Davis Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MIND) Institute</a>, still gets compliments on these mice — even though many of her original findings couldn’t be reproduced in future experiments. While she still works with laboratory mice and stressed their importance in understanding co-morbidities and rare genetic disorders tied to the condition, she noted that how “disrupted brain development manifests in a mouse is never going to be autism, because autism is uniquely human.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when people praise her earlier research on autism-like behavior in mice, “I’m like, that is the biggest mistake this field has ever made,” she said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Billions of dollars have been poured into autism research over the last decade, funding a staggering number of experiments — including over 1,500 studies in the US <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED647174.pdf">in 2020 alone</a>. Many of these studies use animal models, especially mice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether you believe that animal testing <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/14/23794186/animal-testing-experiments-vivisection-academic-fraud-dishonesty-research">is ethical (many don’t)</a>, scientists in numerous research fields — especially neuroscience, genetics, and other areas of biology — <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">run experiments on animals</a>. To understand how cells in the brain communicate to form thoughts and guide behavior, you need a living brain connected to a living body. Millions of rodents are used — and nearly all killed — for science experiments every year, many of which are preclinical tests of new drugs and other treatments with potential public health benefits, including for autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While mouse models have helped us understand how neural connections develop over time, and how they may be affected by autism, they haven’t led to the pharmaceutical treatments many researchers are looking for. So far, all attempts to make drugs that help people manage some of the more challenging effects of autism, like sensory sensitivity or self-harm, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10062405/">have failed</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked senior scientist <a href="https://www.sfari.org/people/brigitta-gundersen/">Brigitta Gundersen</a>, who manages Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (<a href="https://www.sfari.org/">SFARI</a>) funding for autism studies <a href="https://www.sfari.org/resource/autism-rat-consortium/">involving rodents</a>, for an example of a tangible quality of life improvement that this line of research has given us, she paused. “I struggle to think of examples across all of psychiatry, frankly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, figuring out how autism manifests in the brain and body should help scientists develop better treatments for some of its more debilitating symptoms, like seizures, mobility challenges, and self-harm. Given how much we still have to learn about how the brain works, autistic or otherwise, this kind of research is “a really long game,” Gundersen said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s this overall idea that understanding biology and understanding mechanisms will lead to better interventions,” she said. Studying biological systems for the sake of understanding them led to advances in medicine we often take for granted today, like chemotherapy. But the brain the most complicated tissue in the body — so far, at least, the search for medications that effectively treat psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders “hasn’t totally panned out.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mouse models of autism-related gene mutations may help uncover the underlying biology of autism in the long run. But autistic people understandably want tangible support now, and research serving that need is hugely underfunded. “It barely matters to us what a mouse model says,” said Sam Crane, an advocate for people with disabilities and a public member of the federal <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/">Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee</a> (IACC), a group that helps policymakers decide what types of autism research to pay for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others, including the parents of autistic children with very high support needs, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/18/profound-autism-labels-neurodiversity/">fear that deprioritizing biological research will leave their loved ones behind</a>, turning attention away from developing potentially lifesaving treatments. Massive funding agencies like the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) are also wary of those trying to shift autism research away from genetics and neuroscience, arguing that <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102368">scientific breakthroughs often come from long-term studies of fundamental biology</a> — even when those studies don’t seem to offer real-world benefits in the short term.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking at the numbers, though, research exploring how to help autistic people navigate everyday life — the research many autistic people <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/what-we-believe/">say they’d like to see</a> — is still only getting about a quarter of the money allocated for autism research in the US. At a moment when <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/23/autism-epidemic-cdc-numbers/">autism diagnoses are on the rise</a> — for reasons scientists still don’t fully understand — why are we spending so much on mice that might help humans eventually, and so little on services that could help humans now?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The history of autism research, briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder.pdf">as defined by</a> the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), is usually characterized by communication challenges, trouble navigating social interactions, and a high sensitivity to change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also defined by how different the roughly 5.4 million people diagnosed with autism in the US are from each other. The wide umbrella of ASD includes people who live independently, have fulfilling careers and relationships, and can advocate for their own needs. It also includes people who don’t speak much (or at all), use a wheelchair, and may require full-time support from a caregiver for the entirety of their lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biologically speaking, autism — like the brain in general — is still poorly understood. In the 1950s and 1960s, medical professionals embraced the <a href="https://www.autism-help.org/points-refrigerator-mothers.htm">now-discredited “refrigerator mother” theory</a> linking autism to cold, distant parenting, <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/mothers-and-autism-evolution-discourse-blame/2015-04">blaming mothers</a> for their children’s condition. Later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/obituaries/28rimland.html">psychologist Bernie Rimland</a> presented evidence that autism is rooted in biology. Then, former physician Andrew Wakefield <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17057990/andrew-wakefield-vaccines-autism-study">published a paper</a> in 1998 incorrectly linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, fueling the modern <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22958419/covid-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-history">anti-vaccination movement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, most researchers believe that autism is strongly influenced by genetics. However, when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/signs-symptoms/index.html">symptoms can include everything</a> from difficulty reading social cues to seizures to constipation, it’s hard to figure out what genes might be causing what — after all, over several decades of work, scientists have compiled a <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/analysis-sequences-pegs-102-top-autism-genes/?fspec=1">list of 100 or so genes</a> that might be linked to autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To leaders at private funding agencies like SFARI, <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/?utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=IS-branded-conv&amp;utm_content=IS-evergreen&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwooq3BhB3EiwAYqYoEh4tmncVlXtGeW90hFwQGBeNbeY40R_1WxoBEujiGBrP1kGE4wm5ihoCKP4QAvD_BwE">Autism Speaks</a>, and the <a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/">Autism Science Foundation</a> (ASF), that complexity is precisely why we need basic research to explore the underlying biology and genetics of autism.<strong> </strong>The ultimate goal of these funders, several of whom have autistic children, is to find treatments for autism. Historically, some of these institutions <a href="https://the-art-of-autism.com/autism-speaks-revamps-its-mission-statement/">even wanted to find &#8220;cures.&#8221;</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But digging into the genetics of autism in the early aughts raised more questions than answers, forcing researchers to <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/dsm-5-redefines-autism/">reconsider what autism even is</a>. Meanwhile, in the absence of meaningful medical progress, some desperate parents turned to extreme DIY “cures” like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684109/autism-vaccines-treatment-cure-bleach">making their autistic kids drink bleach</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Despite the fact that they’re pointing in diametrically opposed directions, there’s a common theme with the refrigerator mother approach and the anti-vaccine approach,” said <a href="https://healthpolicy.fas.harvard.edu/people/ari-neeman">Ari Ne’eman</a>, assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-founder of the <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/">Autistic Self Advocacy Network</a> (ASAN). “Namely, they both really emphasize the idea of causation as central to the business of autism advocacy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Framing autism as a disease that “happens” to otherwise healthy children as a consequence of their parenting, genetics, or environment makes it feel like something that science can fix, or even prevent in the first place. For many diseases — think deadly cancers — this wouldn’t be controversial.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But many autistic adults <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9233295/autism-rights-kanner-asperger">believe the “causation” framing is hugely misguided</a>. Efforts to pinpoint genetic markers of autism have <a href="https://proto.life/2023/04/prenatal-screening-for-autism-is-an-ethical-dilemma/">raised serious concerns</a> about eugenics — namely, that if parents could get a prenatal test for autism, many of them would choose not to have those children.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prenatal tests for many diseases, like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease, <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/common-tests-during-pregnancy">already exist</a>, and the fears of autism advocates are not unfounded. In Iceland, for example, nearly 100 percent of parents who get prenatal tests for Down syndrome — a chromosomal condition affecting as many as <a href="https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/facts-about-down-syndrome/">6 million people</a> worldwide,<strong> </strong>many of whom live long, healthy, fulfilling lives — <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/iceland-eliminated-syndrome-abortion/">choose to abort their pregnancy</a> if the results are positive, causing the population of Down syndrome children to almost completely disappear there. Even in the US, where <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/370668/how-trump-could-ban-abortion-medication-president">abortion is politically fraught</a>, over <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pd.2910/full%22">two-thirds of parents</a> choose not to give birth after finding out their child will have Down syndrome. Should it also be acceptable for parents to abort a pregnancy if they learn that their child will be autistic?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Autism research was really built with the assumption that the goal is a world without autism,” Ne’eman said. But a growing number of people embrace the neurodiversity movement, proposing that autism is simply <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NeuroTribes-Legacy-Autism-Future-Neurodiversity/dp/158333467X">another way to move through the world</a>. To them, the condition is not something to cure with medication or prevent with prenatal testing. This shift has led to significant controversy in the world of autism research. Autism Speaks <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/autism-speaks-but-should-everyone-listen">came under fire</a> in the mid-2010s for portraying autism as a devastating disease that ought to be stamped out, before <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/14/biggest-autism-advocacy-group-is-still-failing-too-many-autistic-people/">denouncing</a> that rhetoric in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, an effective prenatal test is not widely available — while autism does seem to be strongly influenced by genetics, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/the-problems-with-prenatal-testing-for-autism/">there isn’t a single gene that flags autism</a>. Prenatal tests and emerging <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24105096/crispr-gene-editing-theory-dna-diversity">gene-editing</a> tools like CRISPR seem to work best for conditions caused by a single genetic mutation, like <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sickle-cell-disease">sickle cell disease</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, scientists have listed about 100 genes that all seem related to someone’s likelihood of being diagnosed with autism, making a target for potential screenings, drugs, or other therapies much harder to pin down. Mutations in any one gene don’t necessarily mean that a person will be autistic, or shape what autism will look like for them. While some single-gene mutations cause specific neurodevelopmental disorders that fall under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder, like <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/understanding-fragile-x-syndrome/">fragile X syndrome</a>, they are <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/autism-genetics-explained/">relatively rare</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All considered, autism isn’t currently something that can be addressed by traditional drug development pipelines. Yet, funding for projects studying the biology of autism <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">more than quadrupled</a> since 2008, while funding for projects finding better ways to help autistic people in day-to-day life <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11464144/autism-funding-services-biology">fell or remained stagnant</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061219-3.html">Combating Autism Act</a>, which George W. Bush signed into law in 2006, Congress established the <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/">Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee</a> (IACC). As the name suggests, the Combating Autism Act was focused on finding treatments to prevent or “cure” autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, the vast majority of IACC members were not autistic — and their funding priorities were oriented accordingly. Their <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2009/strategic_plan_2009.pdf">first set of recommendations</a>, published in 2009, <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2009/02/comments-at-february-4-2009-iacc-meeting/">heavily skewed</a> toward funding the search for causes and cures of autism. For example, they proposed spending $75 million on developing animal models of autism — nearly 50 times more than they suggested spending on studying everyday support services for autistic people.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can biologists breed autistic mice? (Not really.)</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of biomedical research, where there are genetic risk factors, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK231336/">there are genetically altered mouse models</a>. But by continuing to fall back on the rodents that they are so accustomed to studying, researchers are holding themselves back from fully understanding how autism manifests in humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mice are small, reproduce quickly, and share about <a href="https://www.genome.gov/10001345/importance-of-mouse-genome">85 percent of their functional genes</a> with humans, making them desirable to geneticists hoping to study diseases outside of the human body. While non-animal models are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">slowly replacing animal testing</a> in many areas of science, “you need a live animal to study a disorder that’s solely behavioral,” Silverman said. “Cells don’t behave.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mice behave, but their behavior is very different from ours. So, neuroscientists have had to stretch <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/why-studying-autism-in-mice-may-be-doomed-to-fail/">to draw parallels</a> between the behavior of mice and autistic humans. If a mouse buries marbles with unusual fervor or over-grooms themselves, a study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108161/">may qualify it as</a> “repetitive behavior.” If a mouse prefers being alone to hanging out with a stranger mouse in its cage, it’s displaying “social deficits.” Studies have even measured changes in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763420304383">ultrasonic vocalizations in mice</a> to try to understand speech problems in autistic humans, and recorded electrical activity from the brains of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202402493">dogs with autism-related gene mutations</a> to see whether LSD could improve their social interactions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal behavior is finicky, though, especially when those animals are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23795087/animal-experiments-primates-mental-health-effective">living in tiny laboratory cages</a>, far from their natural habitat. The same mouse in the same marble-burying setup, for example, may bury fewer marbles than usual one day because it got distracted by the smell of whatever shampoo the experimenter used that morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Human error can play a role, too. An exhausted grad student may miscount the number of times two mice bump noses. Researchers in different labs may not even agree what that nose-bumping behavior means, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/how-artificial-intelligence-is-shaking-up-animal-behavior-studies-in-autism/">or how to classify</a> it in their papers. It “just lends itself to a lack of reproducibility,” Gundersen said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also makes preclinical trials for new treatments, which are often conducted in animals, challenging to translate to humans. Many symptoms, especially those related to social interactions and communication, are distinctly human — so much so that they’re nearly impossible to reproduce in mice. “You know,” Gundersen said, “no mice talk.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, more scientists are rejecting the idea that mice can actually exhibit autistic-like behaviors. “Nobody thinks that mice are people,” Gundersen said. “Nobody thinks that mice are modeling autism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the number of publications featuring “mouse model(s) of autism” in the title <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTQa9l1rWjZRVtuBzBywJUiajxZ-aqDCcq834jrr3YpRgK92L5I3MR0taYvJhpOX0w9OWFgD9YTmErU/pubchart?oid=1977171245&amp;format=image">has steadily increased</a> since they were first introduced in the mid-2000s. A cynic might wonder why scientists are continuing to pursue this line of research, when both autistic self-advocates and a growing number of leaders in biomedicine are saying that it doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ne’eman said that some people in the autistic community jokingly refer to autism research as a “geneticist’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbernick/2020/08/25/the-rebuilding-and-the-autism-full-employment-act-of-2021/">Full Employment Act</a>” — a parallel to the proposed <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2021/10/04/americans-autism-employment-support-514667">Autism Full Employment Act</a>, which would create incentives for workplaces to hire autistic people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The grant application system is really competitive. To boost their chances of getting research funding, applicants increasingly have to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691616687745">twist their research proposals</a> to align with whoever will give them money. A lab interested in studying how gene expression guides brain cells to form connections with each other, for example, could pitch it as an autism study to open up additional funding opportunities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, Ne’eman suspects that some scientists are “looking at the autism research agenda as exclusively or primarily a vehicle for a relatively small number of abstract questions of basic science,” which aims to expand knowledge without necessarily translating to new drugs or other practical applications. Just look at the mice: it’s been clear for years that they’re a bad proxy for autistic people, but many biomedical researchers have built their careers around using them. Moving away from dysfunctional models requires time, money, and critically evaluating old, imperfect findings — something scientists aren’t really incentivized to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People like <a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/teams/dr-alycia-halladay/">Alycia Halladay</a>, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, worry that self-advocates like Ne’eman are too dismissive of basic science. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“At ASF, we strongly believe that the use of model systems is essential to&nbsp;understanding the biology of autism and to developing targeted, personalized interventions that will improve lives,” Halladay wrote in an email statement to Vox. “Use of animal models has been critical to our understanding of dozens of psychiatric disorders, and has helped to improve the lives of those who suffer from those disorders. Autism research must continue to include these important model systems. ASF remains absolutely committed to funding basic biology, genetic discovery, animal models, and pharmaceutical innovation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it isn’t that autistic people don’t value science. Rather, many of them think the somewhat futile search for a “cure” to autism shouldn’t receive as much funding as it does, relative to other areas of research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A more promising path for biomedical researchers could be studying rare neurodevelopmental disorders, like <a href="https://www.angelman.org/">Angelman syndrome</a> and <a href="https://www.rettsyndrome.org/about-rett-syndrome/what-is-rett-syndrome/">Rett syndrome</a>, caused by mutations in a single gene that exists in both mice and humans. People with disorders like these often have symptoms experienced by others with autism, like <a href="https://autism.org/autism-and-seizures/">seizures</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/expert-answers/autism-and-digestive-symptoms/faq-20322778">gastrointestinal issues</a>, and <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/sleep-problems-autism-explained/">insomnia</a> — which are more easily quantifiable in mice than, say, language.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silverman moved her lab in this direction entirely, after <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gbb.12803">losing faith in models</a> of other “autism-like behaviors.” She hopes that a clearer understanding of these specific genetic mutations will lay the foundation for things like better epilepsy medications down the line — not only for those with Angelman syndrome, but for anyone who experiences seizures alongside autism. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I asked Halladay what research she wanted to see, as a <a href="https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/meet-alycia-halladay/">mother of an autistic daughter</a>. She agreed that more investigations of conditions related to autism, like sensory sensitivity, would be incredibly helpful to families like her own. Halladay, like many other parents, doesn’t want her daughter’s autism to go away; she just <a href="https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/meet-alycia-halladay/">wants more support</a> — and possibly medicine — to help her child live the best life possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Autism research is torn between different visions</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In general, Ne’eman thinks that “the average autistic person, as well as the average family member, doesn’t wake up in the morning thinking, ‘Have they found a better mouse model?’” They do think about whether they’ll be able to find a full-time caretaker who is covered by insurance, or what the newest adaptive communication devices will be capable of.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When autistic self-advocates were largely excluded from the decision-making process, funding for things that would help them immediately, like communication assistance or housing support, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8035332/">fell by the wayside</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s since changed — today, the IACC includes 23 non-autistic government employees and 22 public members, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/federal-autism-committee-names-new-members/">seven of whom are autistic</a> themselves. Their budget priorities <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">have shifted accordingly</a>, centering research questions like “What services and supports are needed to maximize health and well-being?” in addition to basic biology studies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, the gap between the committee’s proposed budget and how much funders actually spend <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/portfolio-analysis/2020/portfolio_analysis_2020.pdf?ver=5">has also grown</a>. And while funding for services and support doubled between 2019 and 2020, it still only accounted for 8.4 percent of the money spent that year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One big thing standing in the way of the IACC’s recommendations and reality: The biggest sources of science funding, public and private, weren’t really built to fund things other than biology research. Of the 28 organizations listed as funding autism-related projects between 2019 and 2020, the National Institutes of Health and SFARI — which only award grants for basic science and clinical research — <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/portfolio-analysis/2020/portfolio_analysis_2020.pdf?ver=5">together paid for over 80 percent of research</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Agencies like the <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncser/research/">Department of Education</a> and the <a href="https://acl.gov/">Administration for Community Living</a> pay for projects studying interventions like how to help autistic adults avoid institutionalization and live as independently as possible — <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/what-we-believe/">major priorities for autistic self-advocates</a>. However, they only fund a tiny portion of autism research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Solving this problem will likely require a major redistribution of funding, or a big overall increase in the pool of money available to everyone. “I’m not sure that you can totally fix it by just yelling at the NIH,” Crane said. In fact, she suspects that the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/od/office-of-national-autism-coordination-onac">Office of National Autism Coordination</a>, which oversees management of the IACC, is aware that IACC members want to fund more studies about how to support autistic people. The problem is likely that the NIH — the federal body responsible for funding — may not be receiving grant applications for such studies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One solution the IACC recommended involves <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">growing the overall pool of money</a> set aside for autism research to $685 million by next year. They specifically highlighted three research areas that need the most additional resources: lifespan issues, evidence-based interventions and services, and the development of culturally responsive services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By “lifespan issues,” the IACC means anything related to big life transitions: access to higher education and employment, opportunities to live as independently as possible alongside non-autistic community members, and health care. Figuring out how to help autistic adults — including those with the most severe disabilities — <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2012/08/career-options/">find fulfilling jobs</a> that they’re good at, <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2024/05/beyond-coercion-and-institutionalization/">stay out</a> of harmful psychiatric institutions, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/11/1098150733/dating-coaches-who-specialize-in-working-with-people-with-autism-are-in-demand">form healthy relationships</a> doesn’t require mouse models. It requires piloting initiatives like new <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/resources/housing/websites/">housing programs</a>, building better <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2017/10/everybody-communicates-our-new-toolkit-on-communication-supports/">assistive communication devices</a>, and other community-oriented research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Studying existing interventions to make sure they’re helping autistic people — not just making them appear non-autistic in public — is also crucial, Crane said. For example, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sweetpoochers/video/7405244574127361311?lang=en">applied behavioral analysis (ABA) therapy</a>, which rewards “goal behaviors” like making eye contact or saying hello to people, is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joannareese7/video/7356684281642634539?lang=en">controversial in the autistic community</a> because it can be experienced as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@burritos_and_adhd/video/7039802682588040453?lang=en">abusive and coercive</a>. Most existing studies on the effectiveness of ABA measured things like whether recipients <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/when-disability-defined-behavior-outcome-measures-should-not-promote-passing/2021-07">behaved better in the classroom</a>, rather than long-term outcomes like overall academic achievement or quality of life. With more money, Crane hopes this can change. “We need to be funding research that actually tracks the outcomes that matter to people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line is that we don’t need more mouse models of autism or of autism-like behaviors. Biomedical science has a role to play, especially in helping people manage symptoms of other autism-related health issues like epilepsy and sleep disorders — but it has claimed a disproportionately large chunk of autism research funding for too long.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people, especially the parents of children with intellectual and physical disabilities related to autism, argue that autistic self-advocates who push back against the biomedical research agenda are acting out of self-interest, leaving those with the most severe disabilities behind. People with different experiences of autism, Autism Science Foundation president Alison Singer <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/its-time-to-embrace-profound-autism/">argues</a>, need different things. Specifically, she believes that people with the most severe disabilities need the kinds of pharmaceutical interventions that biomedical research aims to find — and that many autistic self-advocates want to deprioritize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ne’eman believes the opposite is true. “Those with the most severe impairments are especially poorly served by research that does not relate back to their needs,” he said. In its <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/genetic-statement-concerns.pdf">statement on genetic research</a>, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network emphasizes, “Autistic people with the highest support needs are some of the most vulnerable members of our community. They deserve good lives with the right to make their own decisions, not yet another round of ‘cures’ that will not work.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neuroscience still has a lot to offer the autism community, but neuroscientists need to listen to the people they’re claiming to serve. Ditching outdated behavioral tests on mouse models of “autism-like behavior” might be a great place to start.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The </em>Today, Explained<em> podcast is taking a deep dive into the major themes of the 2024 election through the lens of seven battleground states. We’ve heard so far from voters in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0a8ahdph7BGpx9d0ZjzU3q?si=b5fcd333949f4909">Georgia</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4qTFkzBeRxCT5sPluaxd7n?si=13da5fec1295486e">Pennsylvania</a>, and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0d33827slG3WnJObyCr2C1?si=376ff7132c7f4f52">Arizona</a>, and this week we turn to Wisconsin, where rural voters could make the difference.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With less than a month until Election Day, Wisconsin Democrats are pouring time and energy into parts of the state they routinely lose by double digits in the hope of reaching the rural voters who went solidly for Donald Trump in the last two presidential elections. <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/elections/articles/the-2024-swing-states-wisconsin-could-sway-the-presidential-election">All signs indicate</a> that these voters will do so again, but that hasn’t stopped Democrats from <a href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/wisconsin-democrats-continue-fundraising-dominance-over-state-republicans-in-2024/">campaigning</a> fiercely in rural districts to claw back as many voters as they can.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to <a href="https://www.wpr.org/person/rob-mentzer">Rob Mentzer</a>, the rural communities reporter for Wisconsin Public Radio, Democrats are clear-eyed about the fact that they almost certainly won’t win in rural parts of Wisconsin. By narrowing the margins, though, they hope to “lose by less” — and thus win statewide.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If that tactic succeeds, it would be a big deal. Though Wisconsin was long a progressive stronghold, a wave of Republican support in the early 2000s transformed it from part of Democrats’ Midwestern “blue wall” into a <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/4929521-kamala-harris-trump-polls-race/">battleground state</a> often decided by razor-thin margins.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, Biden won the state by just over half a percentage point, thanks in large part to high turnout in Madison, Milwaukee, and other cities. If Harris and incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who is up for reelection, can make gains with rural voters this time, it would expand their path to victory in the state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Today, Explained</em> host Sean Rameswaram<em> </em>spoke with Mentzer about what he’s hearing from rural voters in north-central Wisconsin as Democrats make a play for their support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Can we just talk really quickly about what Wisconsin looked like, I don’t know, before Donald Trump? It used to be a progressive place, right?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wisconsin has a <a href="https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS3588">very long history</a> of progressive politics. From the turn of the 20th century, it was actually one of the birthplaces of the progressive movement. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-M-La-Follette">Robert La Follette</a> was a populist governor, later US senator. He was beloved by the state&#8217;s farmers, by rural areas. And you can <a href="https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS417">draw a straight line</a> from that progressive movement in Wisconsin to a lot of the New Deal legislation and into modern progressivism, for sure.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And what changed? Is it as simple as Donald Trump or is there more to that story?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that it goes back a little bit further than that. So in 2010, there was a massive wave election for Republicans. And one of the Republicans elected that year was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/how-the-democrats-finally-defeated-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker/2018/11/07/3377ed17-9cbe-4537-8b2a-acd0c37a8d35_story.html">Scott Walker</a>, who became Wisconsin&#8217;s governor. Some people will recall the first thing he did in office was to introduce a bill that essentially removed collective bargaining rights from most public unions —&nbsp;teachers, government workers. And there was a huge backlash to this. There were weeks of protests in the state capital. But Republicans won that battle. And then, because 2010 was a <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Redistricting_in_Wisconsin_after_the_2010_census">redistricting year</a>, they used their trifecta power to <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2011/08/08/walker-signs-redistricting-bill-angering-democrats-on-day-of-recall-elections/">entrench those majorities</a> in the legislature. Walker survived a <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2012/06/05/154384654/live-blog-wisconsin-decides-governors-fate-in-recall-vote">recall election</a> in 2012. He won reelection in 2014. And that gets us to the Trump era in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hillary Clinton famously <a href="https://ecommons.udayton.edu/pol_fac_pub/116/">did not visit Wisconsin</a> during the 2016 campaign. And she did not win Wisconsin on election night in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the reasons for that are complicated. But I think that <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/wisconsin-manufacturing-workers-divided-trump-despite-broken-promises-n1245458">manufacturing</a> really is a big part of it. It&#8217;s one of the absolute pillars of Wisconsin&#8217;s economy. There are a lot of rural communities where a paper mill or a window and door manufacturer, a Harley Davidson plant, are the biggest employers. They provide the most jobs. And there was a real and a <a href="https://economicdevelopment.extension.wisc.edu/files/2019/05/Manufacturing_Full-report.pdf">long-term decline</a> in that share of manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin that you can trace as far back as the 1970s all the way into the 2010s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people absolutely blamed NAFTA for that or other free-trade agreements. Those were things that President Bill Clinton had signed into law, was an advocate for, and Hillary Clinton was associated with, while Trump was vocally against.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also, in the 2010s, we saw a lot of <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/98901/err-274.pdf">consolidation of dairy farms</a>, a lot of closures of smaller farms. And I think that those things were part of the change in rural areas that voters reacted to.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is that how Biden flips it back in 2020? Because he&#8217;s got that Obama affiliation and he doesn&#8217;t have that NAFTA affiliation?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a word, no.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Okay!&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The election in 2020 looked a lot like the election in 2016 in Wisconsin. The rural vote came out for Trump in <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2020/12/23/republicans-won-rural-wisconsin-governing/">huge numbers</a>. Bigger than 2016. The only thing is that the vote in Madison and in other Democratic strongholds was a little bigger. Democrats gained ground in the suburbs in Wisconsin in 2020, and it put Biden over the top by about 20,000 votes in Wisconsin, which was enough, but which was less than 1 percent. But the sort of rural base of Trump voters, they <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/05/us/wisconsin-election-results-biden-trump.html">absolutely turned out</a>.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Okay. So let&#8217;s talk about where that leaves us this year, in 2024, in just a few weeks now. It sounded like you were saying you&#8217;d expect Wisconsin to go for Trump again from your vista, is that right?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I&#8217;d certainly expect that the part of the state that I live in to go for Trump again. There&#8217;s no question about that, I don&#8217;t think. It is worth saying that Democrats this year have put a lot of money and resources and volunteer time into rural Wisconsin.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And what are Democrats doing to sort of shift the narrative in rural communities in Wisconsin, Rob? What are they doing to mobilize Democrats and to make new Democrats in these communities where you&#8217;ve been hanging out?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats have opened something like 50 field offices around the state, including more than 30 in counties that Trump won in 2020. They are out knocking on doors and doing direct mail and all the other sort of campaign outreach tactics, including a lot more in-person work than was the case four years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;ve also seen how Kamala Harris is trying to reach out to Republican voters directly. This month, she campaigned with Liz Cheney, a former member of House Republican leadership. They did <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5137349/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-wisconsin-little-white-schoolhouse">that event in Ripon, Wisconsin</a>, which is where the Republican Party was born in the 19th century. And it was explicitly understood as a way to reach out to voters who consider themselves Republican but may be open to voting for Harris.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there&#8217;s Harris&#8217;s vice presidential choice. Tim Walz talks about having rural roots, <a href="https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/08/06/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-has-rural-nebraska-roots/">growing up on a farm in Nebraska</a>. And he just sort of comes off as a rural guy. I passed on a highway in central Wisconsin one of those giant yard signs that said “Harris 2024,” and someone had spray-painted “Tim Walz for VP” underneath it, I guess as a way to emphasize he&#8217;s also part of the ticket. And I do hear from people in rural areas in Wisconsin who feel like they connect with Tim Walz, a hunter. He wears a camo cap and [he’s a] small-town football coach. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then one other factor this year is that for the first time in more than a decade, Wisconsin has <a href="https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/02/26/new-voting-maps-propel-a-surge-of-optimism-for-wisconsin-democrats/">new voting maps</a> that actually do give Democrats a chance of taking back a majority in at least one house of the state legislature. I think that for sure has brought some new attention and additional energy to Democratic organizing on the local level.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Sean Rameswaram</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So do you think it could work? Do you think Democrats could win back rural voters in Wisconsin?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Rob Mentzer</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, they could win back <em>some</em> of the rural voters, maybe. The Democrats I talked to, their goal is to lose by less in these rural areas. So one of those, Jim Davis, said that they&#8217;re not even remotely thinking that they&#8217;re going to get over 50 percent in Taylor County. And so if they can get to 35 percent in areas where maybe they&#8217;re lucky to scrape 25 percent, that can really make a difference in a state as close as Wisconsin.</p>

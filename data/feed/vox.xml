<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, Vox’s Future Perfect is publishing <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/364288"><strong>How Factory Farming Ends</strong></a><strong>, </strong>a package of stories on the past and future of the movement against factory farming, its struggle to change our culture, politics, and palates, and how it might yet make real progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Billions of animals raised for food are treated abysmally. They are, to name just a few standard industry practices, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">caged</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/9/22967328/animal-cruelty-laws-state-federal-exemptions-pennsylvania-martin-farms-dairy-calves-dehorning">mutilated</a> without pain relief, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/10/23589333/cecile-steele-chicken-meat-poultry-eggs-delaware">intensively bred</a> to the point that they live in chronic pain and even struggle to stand up before being <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23647682/factory-farming-dxe-criminal-trial-rescue">slaughtered</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/8/21311327/farmers-factory-farms-cafos-animal-rights-booker-warren-khanna">often</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/opinion/meat-pork-animal-farm.html">painfully</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every year, humans kill 80 billion land animals — 10 times more than there are people on Earth — and an even larger, poorly tracked number of fish.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, factory farming is only expanding its global reach, despite decades of animal advocacy striving to stop it, because people want to eat meat, and it’s the cheapest way to produce lots of it for a world of 8 billion. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This package aims to examine the animal movement’s struggle to make progress, build coalitions, find mainstream support, and explore how it can learn from its failures and move forward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The package features the following stories:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Kenny Torrella </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/e/362224">investigates</a> why the world’s most powerful environmental groups, including the Nature Conservancy and the World Wildlife Fund, help greenwash the meat industry and are reluctant to take it on as the climate threat that it is. In another piece, Torrella presents a dream policy agenda for expanding plant-based food consumption, advocating for creative solutions such as increased government procurement in public institutions and better access for low-income individuals, treating plant-based foods with the same urgency and support as renewable energy.</li>



<li><strong>Marina Bolotnikova</strong> <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/363550">examines</a> the worsening scale of factory farming and the slow progress made by the movement against it and suggests that the animal welfare movement may need to see itself as an early ethical vanguard helping build a future that people alive today will never see.</li>



<li><strong>Jonathan Safran Foer </strong>and<strong> Aaron Gross </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/e/362271">argue</a> that the animal welfare movement must expand its focus beyond animal welfare alone and build a grand coalition with the environmental and public health communities that can highlight the threats that factory farming poses to humans, including zoonotic diseases and antibiotic resistance. They highlight a groundbreaking recent study finding that behavioral nudges, such as making plant-based dishes the default option in settings like university dining halls, could significantly reduce meat consumption while maintaining diner satisfaction.</li>



<li><strong>Astra Taylor </strong>and <strong>Sunaura Taylor </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/e/363069">argue</a> that if progressives are serious about saving our democracy, they must recognize how the meat industry has led the charge to undermine it, including in the recent US Supreme Court case that struck down Chevron deference, a cornerstone of federal regulatory law.</li>



<li><strong>Jan Dutkiewicz </strong>examines PETA&#8217;s paradoxical legacy: Its outlandish tactics have sometimes drawn backlash, but at the same time, the group has played a vital role in forcing a broader conversation about animal rights and supported the cause in less public ways. How does the best-known and most divisive name in animal welfare fit into the modern movement?</li>



<li><strong>Jishnu Guha-Majumdar </strong>argues that despite the vegan movement&#8217;s failure to slow factory farming by changing the diets of the broader public, it remains essential and ought to remain at the heart of the movement&#8217;s goals and strategy. </li>



<li><strong>Noella Williams </strong>explores why the animal movement, despite Black Americans being the fastest-growing vegan demographic, remains predominantly white, highlighting the racial inequality that undermines the movement&#8217;s effectiveness and proposing ways to address it.</li>



<li><strong>Crystal Heath </strong>explores how the meat industry’s political influence has removed consumer choices by flooding the market with subsidized meat and limiting alternatives, such as successfully requiring dairy products be offered in US schools, and proposes a vision for “animal rights 3.0” that involves enlisting veterinarians and other professionals to combat factory farming, rather than relying solely on individual dietary changes.</li>



<li><strong>Kelsey Piper </strong>examines how the Effective Altruism movement helped animal advocates overcome their differences and make meaningful, measurable progress that has helped phase out some of the worst factory farm practices.</li>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’ve spent any time watching the Olympics on NBC or Peacock over the past two weeks, you’ve almost certainly seen them: schmaltzy advertisements for the world’s biggest corporations’ new AI tools. From Google’s Gemini to Microsoft’s Copilot and Meta AI, artificial intelligence is inescapable at the Summer Games, ostensibly an event about showcasing the best of human ability.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zwZG4W1xYI">Meta’s</a> begins with a sad lady on a couch asking AI how to prepare for a marathon. In <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2024/07/23/watch-these-gold-medal-worthy-2024-olympics-paralympics-ads-coca-cola-nike-more">Microsoft’s</a>, a pregnant woman asks Copilot to write an email about weight training (are we sensing a theme here?), while a dad asks it to summarize his morning calls so he has more time to help his son practice boxing. The uplifting music and vaguely inspiring taglines — “Expand your world” and “You, empowered,” respectively — are meant to show how using AI can act as something of a personal assistant, leaving users with more time to spend on the things that matter. As far as Olympics-themed ad campaigns for tech giants go, it’s pretty standard stuff.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was not the case with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgtHJKn0Mck">Google’s “Dear Sydney” ad</a>, which centers around a father whose daughter is an aspiring track star and superfan of American Olympic hurdler Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone. The daughter, we learn, wants to write a letter to tell McLaughlin-Levrone just how much she means to her. But in a baffling move, the father then decides to ask Google’s Gemini to simply churn one out for her, turning what could have been a heartwarming father-daughter bonding moment into an opportunity to generate whatever a chatbot’s version of a fan letter is.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To say it wasn’t a hit would be an understatement. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/31/google-gemini-ai-dear-sydney-ad-olympics-satire/">Washington Post’s Alexandra Petri wrote</a> that the commercial “makes me want to throw a sledgehammer into the television every time I see it,” and that it was “one of those ads that makes you think, perhaps evolution was a mistake.” “Their pitch is really, ‘hey, we can feel and express emotions so your daughter doesn’t have to’?” asked sports writer <a href="https://x.com/ShehanJeyarajah/status/1817582489730461749">Shehan Jeyarajah on X</a>. Tech consultant Shelly Palmer, who advises companies on AI, <a href="https://shellypalmer.com/2024/07/why-googles-dear-sydney-ad-makes-me-want-to-scream/">wrote that</a> “‘Dear Sydney’ was “one of the most disturbing commercials I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After closing down the comments section on its YouTube page, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/google-controversial-dear-sydney-gemini-ai-ad-pulled-nbc-olympics-1236094028/">Google eventually pulled the ad</a> from NBCUniversal’s coverage, writing in a statement to Variety that “We believe that AI can be a great tool for enhancing human creativity, but can never replace it. Our goal was to create an authentic story celebrating Team USA.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not the first marketing blunder by a tech company in recent months. This May, Apple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntjkwIXWtrc&amp;t=58s">released an ad</a> to promote its new iPad in which a hydraulic press literally crushes physical objects used in creative practices: a piano, paint buckets, a mannequin, a drum set, and cameras, leaving nothing but a single iPad. As the Verge’s Elizabeth Lopatto <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24152987/apple-crush-ad-piano-ipad">pointed out</a> at the time, “The message many of us received was this: Apple, a trillion-dollar behemoth, will crush everything beautiful and human, everything that’s a pleasure to look at and touch, and all that will be left is a skinny glass and metal slab.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It wasn’t a great look, considering widespread fears over how technology like AI, which Apple has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/03/three-things-we-learned-about-apples-ai-plans-from-its-earnings/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMtbYxTCNhPgIz9T_e9vMzSv06Fakfw_81Gj9ICSoODcMdZSnwoGUi5J3LnfG7q-kalKS0GawnmwNM1j9_0L-SzkTq2D0mV74_qR0h8uMc6kr4ykxrsX-ZkTrPKjKyCmPowIsFwNMQypo84eGdgvCxEIdf1YWWXPOyUPaQRW0Kfs">invested heavily in</a>, will replace jobs and <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/24152251/virtual-zoom-cashiers-ai-automation-future-work">make existing ones worse</a>. Marketing tactics that boast about AI’s ability to render meaningful activities — like, say, painting, or writing a letter with your daughter — worth little more than a single button-click come across as deeply tone-deaf to a population who is already anxious about the future of the technology. According to a 2023 Pew survey, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/">52 percent of Americans</a> said that they were more concerned than excited about the increased use of AI in their daily lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though its boosters have spent the past two years claiming that artificial intelligence will soon be the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/351041/ai-art-chatgpt-dall-e-sora-suno-human-creativity">“great equalizer” of creativity</a>, turning average joes into artistic geniuses, and that it provides all the perks of a personal assistant with the push of a button, signs as of late point instead to the idea that <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/365292/ai-bubble-nvidia-chatgpt-stock-market-crash">AI is a bubble that may be on the verge of bursting</a>. The stock market’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/365271/stocks-dow-nasdaq-recession-us-economy-fed">heavy losses this week</a> were led by tech companies who have been bullish on AI like chipmaker Nvidia and Amazon, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-boom-faces-crash-landing-stock-market-selloff-nvidia-microsoft-2024-8">in part due to</a> the extraordinarily high cost of running AI models (it’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-chatgpt-costs-openai-to-run-estimate-report-2023-4">estimated</a> that OpenAI spends $700,000 per day to run ChatGPT, and the more it’s used, the higher the cost), and the economic reality that at some point, the bill has to be paid.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tone of the ads recall those for crypto, Web3, and the metaverse that were omnipresent during the 2022 Super Bowl, drafting a cadre of celebrities to shill unregulated currency for the likes of FTX, Coinbase, and Crypto.com. Both heralded their respective technologies as the next great innovation that will make humans hyper-productive (in the case of AI) and rich (both). Since then, following a massive downturn in crypto prices and all three companies either bankrupt or mired in scandal, crypto was <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2023/2/9/23591622/super-bowl-commercials-lvii-crypto-ads">completely absent</a> from the 2023 and 2024 Super Bowls. Even back in 2022, people criticized the ads for their tone-deafness and obvious fraudulence: They “feel like Pets.com all over again,” <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/crypto-super-bowl/">per Wired</a>, citing the notorious tech bubble of the 2000s.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much like crypto, the AI tools peddled by tech companies today <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/2024/3/28/24111721/climate-ai-tech-energy-demand-rising">are environmental disasters</a>, using up as much energy as an entire country. That’s expected to double by 2026, and it also includes the <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/artificial-intelligence-climate-energy-emissions">millions of gallons of water</a> needed to cool the equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those environmental and ethical dilemmas haven’t stopped NBC and the International Olympic Committee from embracing AI wholeheartedly, even as the Paris Games promised to be the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/paris-olympics-sustainability-climate-carbon-emissions-tahiti-85a237ea50cc2f1e5c60b907e06b7299#">“most sustainable” ever held</a>. Some of NBC’s coverage <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/26/tech/al-michaels-ai-olympics/index.html">uses</a> an AI version of 79-year-old sportscaster Al Michaels’ voice, while the IOC launched an Intel-powered chatbot where athletes can ask questions about procedures and scheduling. <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/ai-olympics-paris-2024-says-a-lot-about-ai-promise-and-perils/">Fortune notes</a> that the IOC found 180 use cases for AI at the Olympics, but they largely seemed “like nothing more than marketing gimmicks.” But others, particularly the technology used to track movements within crowds of audience members, raise serious questions about what role we expect AI to take in increased surveillance.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What you’ll see on television, though, are expensive, slickly produced commercials where a woman motivates herself to train for a marathon or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqn3SNyjsSE">a guy gets really excited</a> by an AI-generated photo of the sound a “kersploosh” makes set to Jay-Z’s “Public Service Announcement.” You’ll see a whole lot of sparkle emojis, <a href="https://fastcompanyme.com/co-design/how-the-sparkles-emoji-took-over-ai/">now an industry-wide symbol</a> representing AI that likens the technology to magic (even <a href="https://x.com/rebexxxxa/status/1807799809870274686">though the sparkles never asked</a> to be part of this!). You’ll see <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lesdoggggg/video/7396896822364605726">Leslie Jones asking Gemini</a> to design a gymnastics routine for her and taglines about how AI is a superpower in the palm of your hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The AI industry has far bigger problems than a single poorly executed Google ad. It’s facing existential questions about the product’s&nbsp;viability and practicality, and whether it&nbsp;underdelivers on its promises. The latest spate of AI ad campaigns, for their part, have thus far failed to highlight how its products assist what the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/11/21/what-the-data-says-about-americans-views-of-artificial-intelligence/">majority of Americans actually want to use AI for</a> — namely, help with household chores — and instead end up showing how AI will be used for the things that most of us<em> don’t</em> want it to interfere with: our job prospects, our privacy, and experiences and skills that feel uniquely human. If the world already thinks of AI as menacing, wasteful, and yet another example of market overhype, these ads are only confirming our worst fears. No wonder they come off as so thoroughly insufferable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have been on a fundraising blitz in recent weeks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since President Joe Biden announced his decision to step aside as the Democratic nominee, Harris has raised <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/harris-raises-310-million-july-campaign-shakeup-energizes-donors-2024-08-02/">over $310 million</a> for her campaign, with 66 percent of donations coming from first-time contributors. The Democratic super PAC Future Forward also said it had received <a href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-campaign-biden-drop-out/big-donors-00170367">$150 million in commitments</a> in the first 24 hours after Biden ended his campaign. And by 5 pm on Tuesday, Democrats raised <a href="https://observablehq.com/@rdmurphy/actblue-ticker-tracker">more than $24 million</a> through their ActBlue PAC after Harris announced that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/365437/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vice-president-live-news-updates">would be her running mate</a>. Big-money donors, such as co-founder <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/business-leaders-respond-kamala-harris-selects-tim-walz-vp-2024-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reid Hoffman and billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban</a>, have come out to support her pick, suggesting that they may be writing more checks to her campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of that has largely erased Republicans’ fundraising advantage.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-fundraising-biden-second-quarter-ed2a070b3e513277dc9ab0f57d52b48a">outraising Biden</a> before the president dropped out of the race. In June (the month after he was <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/352465/trump-convicted-felon-elections">convicted of 34 felonies</a>), his campaign took home a $<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/20/fundraising-july-election-trump-biden/">111.8 million haul</a>, and the Republican National Committee had its strongest month of fundraising in years, bringing in $66 million. In the wake of both an assassination attempt against him and the spectacle of the Republican National Convention, Trump bested his June total, reportedly pulling in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-campaign-says-it-raised-1387-million-july-2024-08-01/">$137 million</a> in July.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But how much will any of that money actually impact the results?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">It’s more expensive than ever to run for president</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Presidential campaigns have long been expensive, but the money required to run a successful presidential campaign has ballooned since the Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling in <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/citizens-united-explained"><em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em></a>. That decision allowed corporations and outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections, often via super PACs that operate independently of a campaign. 2020 marked the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/most-expensive-election-ever">most expensive presidential election</a> in US history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Presidential elections are incredibly expensive — at this point, a billion-dollar enterprise,” said Dan Weiner, director of the Brennan Center for Justice’s elections and government program. “You need enough money to mount a viable campaign.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That money goes toward supporting staffers and field offices across the country; ads across television, newspapers, radio, and social platforms; polling and research; as well as voter outreach through rallies, door-knocking, and more.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both grassroots support and big donors are critical to funding a presidential campaign. <em>Citizens United </em>gave the wealthiest donors outsize influence. But grassroots donations are a sign of enthusiasm: They don’t necessarily translate 1-to-1 to votes, but they also function as a signal to big donors about which candidates are the most viable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both Harris and Trump will need to keep the money flowing, said Brendan Glavin, deputy director of research for OpenSecrets. While it’s not that early in the cycle — Trump has been campaigning since November 2022 — the most intense weeks of the election are yet to come. Now is when candidates typically travel more often to battleground states, hold more rallies, fine-tune their strategies through more frequent polling, and ramp up advertising and get-out-the-vote efforts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While recent events have spiked voter enthusiasm in both parties, previous campaigns suggest the most lucrative days might be ahead. There are still 13 weeks until Election Day, and it was in the 10 weeks before the 2020 election that&nbsp;Biden brought in about 60 percent of his overall fundraising haul.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Big fundraising hauls are necessary — but not sufficient — to win</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Money, however, isn’t everything. While the victor in presidential contests often has the fundraising edge, that isn’t always the case. Piles of cash ultimately can’t compensate for poor spending decisions or bad candidates.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden outspent Trump in 2020. But Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State and Democratic nominee in 2016, far outspent Trump yet still lost the election. Her campaign spent heavily in states she didn’t need to win, including Arizona, but neglected Rust Belt states that ultimately cost her the election.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Vox_Presidential_Campaign_FundraisingAdvantage_02.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,17.883846578459,100,64.232306843082" alt="A chart demonstrating how successful presidential campaigns often have a fundraising advantage." title="A chart demonstrating how successful presidential campaigns often have a fundraising advantage." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there are the well-funded campaigns that never really got off the ground because of a weak candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Put lipstick on a pig, it’s still not going to be a good candidate,” said Ray La Raja, associate director of the UMass poll and a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “No amount of money is going to make a bad candidate really good.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s four-month Democratic primary campaign in 2020 that cost him <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/mike-bloomberg-spent-billion-month-presidential-campaign-filing/story?id=70252435">$1 billion</a> of his own money. “In the end, primary voters did not respond to him,” Glavin said. “He had the money. He got his name out there. But he didn’t get the response.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Campaigns like Clinton’s and Bloomberg’s show that money is only one piece of the puzzle. Research suggests that challengers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/upshot/a-campaign-dollars-power-is-more-valuable-to-a-challenger.html">benefit more from campaign spending</a> than incumbents, and that for any candidate, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/18/1245495936/do-early-campaign-ads-really-make-a-diffence-in-the-presidential-election">early spending is more effective than late spending</a>. Incumbents don’t benefit as much from campaign spending because voters often already know who they are and there isn’t as much room to change their minds about that. The research suggests that the more incumbents spend, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/upshot/a-campaign-dollars-power-is-more-valuable-to-a-challenger.html">more likely they are to lose</a> — the spending itself is usually a signal that they are in hot water.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has some advantages of an incumbent in that she has Biden’s campaign apparatus behind her, but in other respects, she fits the profile of a challenger.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That marginal dollar is worth more to a challenger. And she’s more in that role, because let’s face it: Most people don’t know what the vice president does,” La Raja said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris is still introducing herself — and Walz as her new running mate<strong> </strong>— to the American public. She is newly in the spotlight and has a window to shape her image in a way that a typical candidate might not. Her campaign is therefore spending heavily on ads right now, dropping <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/07/30/kamala-harris-ad-buy-2024-trump">$50 million on paid media</a> ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s a well-known dynamic in presidential races that you try to define your opponent early,” Weiner said. “I have no doubt that what the Harris campaign wants to do — and also part of the reason why it was so critical that they raise so much money so quickly — is to define her before the Trump campaign can define her.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans may have somewhat forgotten what the Trump presidency was like, but as a former president, Trump is already fairly well-defined to voters and fits the profile of an incumbent more readily than a challenger. As a result, his strategy has been to leverage established recognition — and go on offense against Harris with a <a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/election-2024/gop-kamala-harris-2024-ads/">slate of attack ads</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there are diminishing returns on ad spending, since the media gives presidential candidates so much free coverage. Trump may not have spent as much as Clinton in 2016, but he certainly benefited from the media limelight that year —&nbsp;and so did the media, which experienced a “<a href="https://www.axios.com/2020/11/24/washington-post-new-york-times-subscriptions">Trump bump</a>” in viewers and readers. This year, Trump has successfully fundraised off of big media events, like a conviction or the assassination attempt against him. So, too, has Harris after Biden dropped out.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their fundraising — and electoral — success will likely depend on whether that momentum lasts. Also, at a certain point, “money has diminishing returns,” Weiner said. There are only so many ads a candidate can buy, doors they can knock on and rallies they can hold to make their best case to voters. Once a candidate and their positions are well-understood, they can only hope that voters prefer them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you’ve raised enough money, raising even more money doesn’t help you that much,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">In late 2010, McDonald’s convened representatives from the world’s largest meat companies for the inaugural <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230610190116/https://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/11/prweb4741744.htm">Global Conference on Sustainable Beef</a>, a three-day affair held in Denver.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the surface, the conference was meant to demonstrate that the beef industry was willing and able to reduce its environmental footprint. But in truth, it served as a gathering for industry to discuss its very survival in a world that had become alarmed about climate change. <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/is-sustainable-beef-really-a-thing">According</a> to a beef industry news site, the 300 conference participants came together to “begin the process of reclaiming, defining and embracing the concept of sustainability to assure the future of beef production, and beef consumption, worldwide.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meat producers and fast food giants had reason to worry. Four years earlier, in 2006, the United Nations had published a <a href="https://www.fao.org/3/a0701e/a0701e00.htm">landmark report</a> that singled out animal agriculture as one of the most polluting industries on the planet, one that has “such deep and wide-ranging environmental impacts that it should rank as one of the leading focuses for environmental policy.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The report was noteworthy in part because it provided the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03690-w">first estimate</a> of animal agriculture’s significant role in global warming. Fossil fuels like coal and oil had already been targeted as environmental villains, and the meat industry had to fear that it would be next.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the meat industry did what other industries have done under similar pressure in the past: demonstrate that it could change just enough to avoid being forced to change even more by the government. Ann Veneman, who served as agriculture secretary under President George W. Bush, said as much during her keynote address at the Denver conference. <a href="https://www.thecattlesite.com/news/32531/conference-tackles-beef-sustainability">According</a> to another beef industry news site, Veneman “made it very clear that if the industry ignores the problem, then somebody else will get to define the issue for the industry, and in many cases that means governments imposing unworkable regulations.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>This piece is part of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics">How Factory Farming Ends</a>, a collection of stories on the past and future of the long fight against factory farming</strong>. This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Denver conference led to the creation of a new organization: the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, a <a href="https://grsbeef.org/members/">network</a> of beef processors, fast food chains, and other industry stakeholders, which has since spun out a dozen national and regional roundtables. The US roundtable’s 154-page “<a href="https://www.beefsustainability.us/Media/SustainableBeef/Docs/master_030220_framework_-final.pdf">sustainability framework</a>” provides ranchers and others throughout the supply chain with recommendations, like how to reduce water pollution and optimize energy efficiency. But the group explicitly imposes no standards or verification schemes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To put it in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcberman1/2024/01/10/wheres-the-beef-the-iconic-clara-peller-spot-for-wendys-turns-40/">fast food terms</a>, it’s all bun and no beef. Yet for more than a decade, McDonald’s and other <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2020/08/07/grazing-toward-a-sustainable-beef-supply-chain">food</a> <a href="https://www.wendys.com/csr-what-we-value/food/responsible-sourcing/beef">giants</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.meatinstitute.org/press/proposed-changes-packers-stockyards-act-could-harm-industry-sustainability-efforts">meat lobbying</a> <a href="https://www.ncba.org/ncba-news/news-releases/news/details/25384/ashley-mcdonald-on-the-us-roundtable-for-sustainable-beef">groups</a>, have <a href="https://www.rbi.com/sustainability/responsible-sourcing/beef/">pointed</a> to the roundtables as proof they’re taking climate change seriously.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But after 14 years, McDonald’s, like other arms of the broader meat industry, has little to show for it all, and in fact — as one executive <a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/story-mcdonalds-10-year-quest-sustainable-beef">admitted</a> to GreenBiz earlier this year — the company doesn’t even yet know how to measure and validate progress. (McDonald’s and the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef did not respond to a request for comment.) </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The story of McDonald’s and the beef industry’s sprawling network of roundtables is just one part of an <a href="https://changingmarkets.org/press-releases/groundbreaking-report-reveals-how-meat-and-dairy-industries-have-derailed-climate-action-globally/">extensive campaign</a> by the meat and dairy sector to downplay its environmental impact, delay regulations, deflect responsibility, and assure the public and policymakers that its voluntary initiatives are sufficient to avert environmental ruin. And it’s working: From 2010 to 2022, US meat production increased by over <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-production-tonnes?tab=chart&amp;country=~USA">13 percent</a> while the industry successfully staved off calls for regulation <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22379909/big-meat-companies-spend-millions-lobbying-climate">at home</a> and on the <a href="https://qz.com/ipcc-report-on-climate-change-meat-industry-1850261179">international stage</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is terribly surprising — it’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/the-meat-industry-is-doing-exactly-what-big-oil-does-to-fight-climate-action/2021/05/14/831e14be-b3fe-11eb-ab43-bebddc5a0f65_story.html#:~:text=For%20decades%2C%20the%20meat%20industry,greenhouse%20gases%20and%20emissions%20reporting.">largely the same</a> denial and deflection playbook run by Big Oil to avoid responsibility for climate change, with the usual suspects helping: <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03690-w">industry-aligned academics</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90931204/beyond-impossible-disinformation-mystery-berman">front</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cultivated-meat-pr-cew-center-environment-welfare-berman/">groups</a>, <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/research/data-visualizations/agribusiness-political-donations-and-farm-bill-votes">loyal</a> <a href="https://thefern.org/2019/12/a-breathtaking-lack-of-oversight-for-air-emissions-from-animal-farms/">politicians</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/03/beef-industry-public-relations-messaging-machine">social media influencers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But among those allies are groups that <em>are</em> surprising: some of the world’s largest environmental organizations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take the World Wildlife Fund, or WWF, a green giant with over $600 million in assets. WWF and McDonald’s are both founding members of the beef roundtable, and later, the two worked together on other beef-related projects. In fact, that inaugural conference in 2010 was officially titled the <a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/home/article/15494079/feeding-10-billion-people-the-challenge">World Wildlife Fund Global Conference on Sustainable Beef</a>. (WWF has helped to found <a href="http://assets.wwf.org.uk/downloads/wwf_certification_and_roundtables_briefing.pdf">similar industry roundtables</a> for <a href="https://www.us-rspe.org/index.cfm">poultry</a> and <a href="https://responsiblesoy.org/?lang=en">soy</a> — most of which is fed to farmed animals — and a certification program for <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/industries/championing-sustainable-solutions#:~:text=WWF%20co%2Dfounded%20the%20Marine,organization%20for%20sustainably%20caught%20seafood.">seafood</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For its collaboration, McDonald’s makes sure WWF is well compensated; from 2015 to 2022, the company donated $4.5 to $9 million to WWF-US.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From 2017 to 2022, WWF-US brought in approximately $12 million to $28.6 million from various meat, dairy, seafood, fast food, restaurant, and grocery companies, including Tyson Foods, Cargill, Burger King, Costco, Walmart, Red Lobster, Chobani, and Dairy Management Inc., a dairy trade group. (WWF only discloses donation ranges, not specific dollar amounts, and many of its corporate donations are multifaceted, used to address meat and other parts of a company’s supply chain, like plastics, palm oil, and food waste.) </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/ycmiO-wwf-partners-on-sustainability-initiatives-with-companies-that-sell-produce-or-promote-meat-and-dairy-and-is-given-millions-in-return-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.467305335858,100,69.065389328283" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“One of the key reasons WWF works with large companies like McDonald’s is to drive industry progress, beyond a company’s own operations,” said <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/leaders/sheila-bonini">Sheila Bonini</a>, WWF’s senior vice president of private sector engagement. “Roundtables are a great starting point for bringing the right people together to work toward a common goal.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">WWF is hardly alone. Two of the other largest US environmental organizations — the Nature Conservancy (TNC) and Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) — also closely collaborate with large meat and dairy companies, ranchers, and trade groups on a range of initiatives. But outside observers, along with some former and current employees at EDF and WWF, argue that those initiatives often do more to improve the companies’ image than the environment.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Companies want to work with the Environmental Defense Fund because it boosts their reputation as climate leaders,” a current EDF employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation,<strong> </strong>told me — speaking about EDF’s corporate partnerships broadly, not just for agriculture. “But instead of calling them out for causing harm, EDF lets them pollute and praises them for what little they do in hopes we’ll eventually convince them to change. So EDF provides cover for businesses by letting them set their own ambition.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Partnerships between these organizations and industry often fall into two buckets. The first bucket entails borrowing practices from “<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.577723/full?">regenerative agriculture</a>,” an organic-style farming ethos that has broken into the mainstream in recent years and that promises to slash agricultural carbon emissions and conserve nature. The second includes a set of technologies intended to reduce the livestock sector’s greenhouse gas footprint, such as incorporating seaweed into cow’s diets or changing how animal manure is managed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of these efforts can provide modest environmental benefits and are worth pursuing in the same way that it’s worth pushing for, say, more efficient gas-powered cars. But such partnerships can also quickly veer into greenwashing, in which a product or practice’s environmental impact, with the help of green organizations, is exaggerated for PR effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The taking over of these organizations for greenwashing has reached such a level that I think we need to be honest about it,” said <a href="https://ppc.uiowa.edu/people/silvia-secchi">Silvia Secchi</a>, a natural resource economist and professor of geographical and sustainability sciences at the University of Iowa. “Because it&#8217;s pretty obvious that the industry is using them, and whether willing or not, they&#8217;re letting themselves be used.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most importantly, these partnerships obscure what environmental scientists increasingly <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">say</a> rich countries must do to meet global climate targets: rapidly shrink livestock populations and shift to a more plant-based food system.</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a clear parallel with the fossil fuel industry. Rather than acquiesce to phasing out oil and gas, fossil fuel companies have often proposed their own slate of half-measure solutions, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/363076/climate-change-solution-shell-exxon-mobil-carbon-capture">carbon capture and storage</a>, while continuing to expand oil and gas production.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The environmental community has largely called these activities out for what they are: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dont-fall-for-big-oils-carbon-capture-deceptions/">greenwashing</a>. There are some exceptions — <a href="https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/2023/01/20/what-doe-should-consider-as-it-makes-decisions-on-carbon-capture-and-storage-demonstration-projects/">Environmental Defense Fund</a> and <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-insights/perspectives/carbon-capture-utilization-storage-albritton/">the Nature Conservancy</a> both support carbon capture and storage, but they’re careful to note that such technologies must be paired with an aggressive transition to a renewable energy economy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But those groups’ careful messaging is absent when it comes to meat production. Both tend to support the livestock industry’s half-measure solutions while neglecting to push for a shift away from our meat-heavy food system.&nbsp;And that avoidance is rarely questioned from the outside, likely due to the public’s own ignorance of animal agriculture’s harms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://madrebrava.org/insight/people-don-t-see-industrial-meat-as-a-key-cause-of-global-warming-poll">Surveys</a> show that Americans <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/8/23863100/tyson-climate-friendly-beef-burger-usda">grossly underestimate</a> the toll of meat and dairy on the planet. Some of that is optics: A power plant emitting plumes of black smoke screams pollution, while a pasture of cattle, chickens, or pigs along the highway looks natural and quaint — even eco-friendly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But seasoned environmentalists I spoke with told me that even many of their peers don’t grasp the connection between animal agriculture, climate change, and pollution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Globally, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat">80 billion</a> land animals and <a href="https://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2">1 trillion to 2 trillion</a> aquatic animals are slaughtered for food each year, producing greenhouse gas emissions in five main ways: deforestation to graze cattle and grow corn and soy to feed farmed animals; pollution from the fertilizer used to grow those corn and soy crops; manure, which is high in nitrous oxide, a significant greenhouse gas; diesel from fishing vessels and nitrous oxide-rich waste from fish farms; and the largest single source, the world’s 1.5 billion cows who burp out methane, another potent greenhouse gas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Added up, meat and dairy production account for an estimated <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23738600/un-fao-meat-dairy-livestock-emissions-methane-climate-change">14.5 percent to 19.6 percent</a> of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to researchers at the University of Illinois and the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. That squarely makes it a leading driver of global warming, on par with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-transport">road transport</a>. While it composes a smaller share of emissions in the US, at around 7 percent according to experts’ analysis of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <a href="https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/us-ghg-inventory-2024-main-text_04-18-2024.pdf">data</a>, that’s less a function of how much meat Americans eat — <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/meat-consumption-by-country">which is a lot</a> — than how much more we pollute through our energy and transportation sectors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even that estimate of 7 percent is probably too low, primarily because numerous sources of emissions from farming and food are attributed by the EPA to other sectors, including but not limited to on-farm electricity and combustion, food waste, converting land to agriculture, and the entire seafood industry. And while the US is <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/AEO2023_Release_Presentation.pdf">expected to continue</a> to make progress in reducing its emissions from fossil fuels as the country switches to clean energy and electric vehicles, less progress has been seen in the agricultural sector. In fact, in 2015 the US Department of Agriculture predicted that America’s agricultural greenhouse gas footprint would be roughly the same in 2050 as it is today. (In 2020, the USDA <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/aia-year-one-report.pdf">established a goal</a> of halving US agricultural emissions by 2050, but is in no way on a path to meet it.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is also something unique about animal agriculture that is often underappreciated in the climate debate: It requires a vast amount of land — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/#xj4y7vzkg">far more</a> than any other industry and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/10/20/23924061/public-grazing-land-cattle-meat-carbon-opportunity-cost">far more</a> than plant-based foods. If we ate fewer animal products, some of that land could be restored as grasslands and forests, which remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in trees and soil, effectively canceling out some of the emissions that humans generate while providing habitat for wildlife.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s what’s called the “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00603-4">carbon opportunity cost</a>” of meat. In rich countries, which eat a lot of meat, that cost is massive. According to a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00603-4">2020 study</a> led by <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/matthew-hayek.html">Matthew Hayek</a>, a New York University environmental studies professor, a shift to plant-based eating in rich countries would free up enough land to sequester an amount of carbon dioxide approximately equal to the past nine years of their fossil fuel emissions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to several <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01605-8">studies</a>, including an influential 2020 <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7357">paper</a> in the journal <em>Science</em>, we don’t have much of a choice but to move to a more plant-based food system in order to meet global climate targets. Even if we were to end global fossil fuel use immediately, food consumption trends over the next century — namely rapid growth in meat and dairy consumption — would “make it impossible” to meet the Paris Climate Agreement, as the <em>Science</em> paper puts it. “Plant-rich diets,” it found, hold the most promise for making the global food system compliant with the Paris agreement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the climate impact of the meat we eat. But animal agriculture is also arguably America’s <a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/59792">largest source</a> of water pollution and a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.0c00424">leading source</a> of air pollution, linked to more premature deaths than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/05/10/farm-pollution-deaths/">coal power plants</a>. It is the leading cause of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/world-lost-one-third-forests">global deforestation</a> — a leading cause, in fact, of just about everything the environmental movement fights against.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/P1bP0-the-demand-for-more-meat-is-the-leading-cause-of-deforestation-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=1.2194244604317,0,97.561151079137,100" alt="A chart showing how livestock grazing and cropland have caused deforestation over time. " title="A chart showing how livestock grazing and cropland have caused deforestation over time. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet only a couple of big US environmental groups challenge the meat industry. The rest ignore it altogether or collaborate with the industry on questionable initiatives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To understand how green groups think about meat, I spoke with nearly 40 people in or adjacent to the environmental movement: scientists, funders, lawyers, academics, nonprofit employees, and volunteers. What I found was a movement sharply divided.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many environmentalists, I discovered, understand the science but are afraid of the political backlash that could come if they are seen as trying to snatch burgers, nuggets, and ribs away from the American public. Many, I was told, also fear criticizing farmers and the powerful agribusiness lobby, given the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">enduring myths</a> we tell ourselves about American agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even though reducing meat production in rich countries is a critical component of meeting global climate targets, there’s a sense among large environmental groups that sweeping changes to America’s diet and agricultural policy regime are unattainable. It’s created a collective action problem from which the movement can’t seem to break free.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other greens expressed deep frustration over their fellow environmentalists’ indifference to the meat industry’s environmental destruction, or worse, some organization’s willingness to partner with companies on greenwashing projects.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The environmental movement has taken on powerful industries in the past and won. But thus far, it’s largely been groups dedicated to animal welfare — which have a fraction of the budget and public credibility of environmentalists — challenging Big Meat’s pollution and advocating for a more plant-based food system. Major environmental groups may think they’re playing it safe, but until they join that fight, they will ultimately fail in their goal of averting potential climate and ecological catastrophe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The curious case of “climate-friendly” beef </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While WWF’s work with McDonald’s and the beef industry is one of the green movement’s more high-profile corporate partnerships, a recent project has proved to be even more controversial among environmentalists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, Tyson Foods — America’s largest meat processor — began selling beef marketed as “<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/8/23863100/tyson-climate-friendly-beef-burger-usda">climate-friendly</a>.” The company claims that by getting some of its suppliers to graze their cattle and grow the animals’ feed crops in a more sustainable manner, it’s reduced the carbon footprint of some of its beef by 10 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Tyson has repeatedly declined to share data with Vox and other news outlets that could prove its claim. The USDA, which approved Tyson’s climate-friendly beef label, wouldn’t share data either. The nonprofit Environmental Working Group submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to learn more, and the documents it received back were <a href="https://static.ewg.org/upload/pdf/2023-FSIS-00236-F_Records.pdf?_gl=1*1i6gyqf*_gcl_au*NDMzNjc4NDEwLjE3MjIyNzgwNTU.*_ga*MjAwMTY1OTYxNC4xNzIyMjc4MDU2*_ga_CS21GC49KT*MTcyMjI4ODM4NS4yLjEuMTcyMjI4ODQwNy4zOC4wLjExOTUyNDYzOTc.&amp;_ga=2.138060400.1981602355.1722278056-2001659614.1722278056">heavily redacted</a>. EWG <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2024/05/does-cattle-feedlot-look-climate-friendly-you">said</a> the USDA cited the need to protect “trade secrets.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But let’s assume Tyson could prove a 10 percent emissions reduction. Its beef still wouldn’t qualify as anything that should be called “climate-friendly,” according to <a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/our-experts/scott-faber">Scott Faber</a> of the Environmental Working Group. Even though US companies tend to produce food <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378018306101#sec0085">more</a> <a href="https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/comparing-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-dairy-pork-systems_0.pdf">efficiently</a> than the global average, a 10 percent reduction would still make beef the worst food for the climate — by far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Using <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216">global averages</a>, beef’s carbon footprint per 100 grams of protein is about 7 times that of pork, 9 times that of poultry, 25 times that of tofu and plant-based meat, and more than 60 times that of beans and lentils.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/lw3Vx-plant-based-proteins-have-much-lower-carbon-footprints-than-animal-based-proteins-nbsp-3.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,23.652002447814,100,52.695995104372" alt="A chart showing that plant-based proteins have lower carbon emissions that meat-based proteins.

<p class="has-text-align-none"></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tyson’s misleading marketing is predictable — the USDA, which also helped <a href="https://thefeed.blog/2022/09/16/tyson-foods-leads-152m-effort-to-support-adoption-of-sustainable-agriculture-practices-as-part-of-usda-program%EF%BF%BC/">fund</a> Tyson’s “climate-friendly” beef project, gives meat companies <a href="https://www.vox.com/22838160/animal-welfare-labels-meat-dairy-eggs-humane-humanewashing">significant leeway</a> to exaggerate animal welfare and sustainability claims on their packaging.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what’s more troubling is that Tyson didn’t act on its own — it got help from the Nature Conservancy and Environmental Defense Fund, both of which provided technical assistance. Tyson also benefited in another way: The company mentions the organizations on its <a href="https://www.tysonfoods.com/climate-smart-beef-program">website</a> and in its <a href="https://deloitte.wsj.com/articles/how-tyson-foods-uses-big-data-to-make-lower-emissions-beef-7c9234a7">advertising</a> to boost the credibility of its climate-friendly claim.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked <a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/michael-wironen/">Michael Wironen</a>, director of corporate engagement for food and water at the Nature Conservancy, if he had any concerns over his group’s inclusion in Tyson’s advertising, he said that companies should be scrutinized for greenwashing but that he doesn’t “have an opinion one way or the other about how [Tyson] should be branding that product.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Nature Conservancy was paid a nominal fee for its work, according to a spokesperson, who declined to share the amount. The spokesperson also said the organization’s Arkansas chapter had received money from Tyson Foods for local conservation work and declined to answer whether TNC has received money from other meat companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I very much agree that it’s critical for companies to be transparent about their climate goals and actions,” said <a href="https://www.edf.org/people/katie-anderson">Katie Anderson</a>, senior director of food and forests at Environmental Defense Fund, in an email. “It’s a key pillar of our advocacy with companies across all sectors.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, Tyson refuses to disclose its data, even as it hawks beef products with EDF’s name in its marketing. An EDF spokesperson said the company severely limits corporate donations and that after conducting a search of its records over the past 10 years, it hasn’t received a donation from a meat, dairy, fast food, or grocery company.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Secchi, the University of Iowa professor, criticized the two groups’ work on the project as “shameful.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This could be just the beginning of more questionable climate claims on meat and dairy packaging that come with the imprimatur of environmental groups. The Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef, Tyson, McDonald’s, Cargill, Nestlé, WWF, EDF, and<strong> </strong>TNC — along with the World Resources Institute and the Stockholm Environment Institute — are all <a href="https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/2023-12/Project%20Overview_18%20Dec%202023.pdf">involved</a> in crafting a new <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/22/meat-climate-impact-tyson-hopdoddys/">emissions accounting framework</a> that will influence what climate claims food companies can make under new state laws.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some environmental groups and academics lambasted the draft guidelines when they came out late last year, saying they would enable meat and dairy companies to make only minor adjustments to how they use land and claim their products are carbon neutral, or even carbon negative.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The process was incrementally eroded until it became fully captured by the companies who want to get credit for addressing climate change without changing what they are doing,” Tufts environmental policy professor William Moomaw <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/22/meat-climate-impact-tyson-hopdoddys/">told</a> the Washington Post.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The false promise of regenerative agriculture</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most of the <a href="https://brazenmeats.com/our-process/">practices</a> that Tyson says help it achieve its 10 percent emissions reduction fall under the umbrella of regenerative agriculture, which is often framed as a holistic alternative to the ills of industrialized agriculture.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">One surprising thing</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s a lot of momentum around the potential of regenerative agriculture. </strong>Advocates say it can drastically reduce the climate impact of beef, but the <a href="https://tabledebates.org/publication/grazed-and-confused">science</a> says it’s a lot more complicated. While regenerative farming can help reduce water pollution and improve soil health, it can’t significantly cut planet-warming emissions from cows. It also requires tons of land, which means that if we want more regenerative beef, Americans need to eat a lot less of it.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, regenerative agriculture has risen from the fringes of farming to mainstream awareness, championed as a major climate change solution by leading environmental groups and figures as varied as <a href="https://www.agdaily.com/insights/joe-rogan-podcast-skids-into-farming-fringes/">Joe Rogan</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=807557089601152">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY)</a>, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/donald-glover-jason-momoa-common-ground-documentary-clip-1235510404/">Jason Momoa</a>, and <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/rfk-jr-s-vp-pick-spreads-trumps-anti-wind-claims/">Nicole Shanahan, RFK Jr.’s running mate</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What exactly is it? While there’s no agreed-upon <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/sustainable-food-systems/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.577723/full">definition</a>, the regenerative solution for growing crops, like the corn fed to Tyson’s cattle, typically entails <a href="https://www.climatehubs.usda.gov/hubs/northeast/topic/cover-cropping-improve-climate-resilience#:~:text=Cover%20crops%20increase%20soil%20organic,even%20help%20suppress%20some%20pests.">planting “cover” crops</a> over the winter ​​​​to help prevent soil erosion and <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/blog/2017/11/30/saving-money-time-and-soil-economics-no-till-farming">avoiding tilling</a>, or disturbing, the soil between harvests, among other practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These practices do have proven ecological benefits, namely reducing water pollution and improving soil health. But <a href="https://rodaleinstitute.org/why-organic/issues-and-priorities/carbon-sequestration/#:~:text=During%20this%20exchange%2C%20the%20sugars,truly%20means%20a%20healthier%20planet.">many</a> of regenerative agriculture’s most strident <a href="https://regenerationinternational.org/cool/">proponents</a> go much further, claiming it has the power to significantly slow down or even reverse climate change. The argument is that healthier soil can better remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in farmland, making it a compelling climate change solution. All that carbon from tailpipes and smokestacks? The soil can supposedly draw a lot of it down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Soil carbon sequestration through regenerative agriculture is the single best way to take carbon out of the atmosphere,” as Al Gore <a href="https://www.thefencepost.com/news/gore-talks-about-his-farm-carbon-sequestration-fossil-fuel/">put it</a> last year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has made it clear that the world <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/sustainability/our-insights/sustainability-blog/now-the-ipcc-has-recognized-that-carbon-removals-are-critical-to-addressing-climate-change-its-time-to-act">needs negative emissions technologies</a> — approaches that can pull carbon out of the atmosphere, as regenerative agriculture supposedly does — to avoid catastrophic global warming.<strong> </strong>But the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/farmers-paid-millions-trap-carbon-soils-will-it-actually-help-planet">research</a> doesn’t <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-2-summer/feature/dirt-first-carbon-farming-regenerative-agriculture">bear out</a> the claims many of regenerative agriculture’s proponents make, as there’s still significant <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/farmers-paid-millions-trap-carbon-soils-will-it-actually-help-planet">doubt</a> and <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/2022-2-summer/feature/dirt-first-carbon-farming-regenerative-agriculture">uncertainty</a> around the potential for farmland to store a lot of carbon.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, we don’t have accurate and affordable measurement tools, and carbon sequestration rates diminish over time. No-till farming, one of the most common regenerative farming methods, likely isn’t the climate solution it’s cracked up to be: Most no-till farmers still <a href="https://civileats.com/2021/05/03/carbon-markets-stand-to-reward-no-till-farmers-but-most-are-still-tilling-the-soil/">occasionally till</a> their acres, and each time they do, they release a significant amount of stored carbon. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016706122003354">2022 meta-analysis</a> found that no-till was effectively no better at carbon storage than conventional farming, though it could have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-47861-7#Sec3">some effect</a> in certain climates and soils.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think the climate argument in general with regenerative agriculture … is pretty bogus,” said <a href="https://apec.umn.edu/people/derric-pennington">Derric Pennington</a>, a former lead scientist at WWF and now a senior sustainability scientist at the University of Minnesota.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite that, large meat and dairy companies — like Tyson, <a href="https://www.cargill.com/sustainability/regenerative-agriculture">Cargill</a>, <a href="https://www.agdaily.com/news/new-land-olakes-initiative-better-incentivizes-farmers-to-go-regenerative/">Land O’Lakes</a>, chicken giant <a href="https://corporate.perduefarms.com/company-stewardship-report-flipbook/assets/PerdueFY23CompanyStewardshipReport_2023-08-16_17-19-04.pdf">Perdue Farms</a>, pork giant <a href="https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/smithfield-case-study.pdf">Smithfield Foods</a>, and dairy giant <a href="https://www.danonenorthamerica.com/newsroom/details/danone-north-america-shares-progress-on-regenerative-agriculture-program-covering-nearly-150000-acres-and-75-of-its-dairy-milk-volume.html.html.html.html">Danone</a> — have embraced these practices, claiming their deployment as a climate win. Doing so gives these companies license to claim that not only are they not a major cause of climate change and pollution, but they can be an active solution. And it’s not uncommon for them to receive praise or support from <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/blogs/sustainability-works/posts/three-new-corporations-take-on-sustainable-agriculture-a-win-for-water-and-climate-resilience">WWF</a>, <a href="https://www.cargill.com/2020/the-nature-conservancy-cargill-mcdonalds-and-target-unite">the Nature Conservancy</a>, or <a href="https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/content/smithfield-case-study.pdf">Environmental Defense Fund</a> for these efforts. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s crop farming. But much of the environmental movement’s interest in regenerative agriculture lies with beef, the most carbon-intensive food product, which accounts for about <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/research/publications/publication/?seqNo115=402563">half</a> of US livestock emissions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When cattle are left to their own devices on pasture, they overgraze — trampling on and eroding the soil, and <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/11/113003">destroying vegetation</a>. But regenerative ranchers use rotational grazing — part of Tyson’s “climate-friendly” beef program — which entails periodically moving cattle between plots of land. This can help prevent overgrazing because vegetation is given time to regrow, resulting in healthier soil that advocates say can sequester large amounts of carbon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How much? In 2017, a team of agricultural researchers in Europe and Australia published a <a href="https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/reports/fcrn_gnc_report.pdf">sprawling report</a> on the subject titled “Grazed and Confused?” The authors found that variants of rotational grazing have the potential to offset 20 percent to 60 percent of emissions from ruminant animals (including cattle, goats, and sheep), with the higher-end estimate <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/">under</a> “very generous assumptions.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Newer research results are similarly mixed, with a couple of <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2020.544984/full">studies</a> showing <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308521X17310338">sizable effects</a> (which have also <a href="https://tdaynard.com/2018/07/22/critique-of-impacts-of-soil-carbon-sequestration-on-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-midwestern-usa-beef-finishing-systems-2018-by-dr-paige-l-stanley-et-al-michigan-state-university/">generated</a> <a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/03/big-agriculture-funding-regenerative-ranching-amp-grazing-soil-carbon">critique</a> and <a href="https://civileats.com/2021/01/06/a-new-study-on-regenerative-grazing-complicates-climate-optimism/">skepticism), while</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301479721004710?via%3Dihub">other experiments</a> have shown little to <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/10/11/tom-steyer-2020-climate-229843/">no effect</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At first glance, it appears to be a mildly promising approach to cutting emissions from cattle. But just like with regenerative<strong> </strong>crop farming, it comes with a <a href="https://edepot.wur.nl/516983">series of caveats</a> that deflate much of its potential. It must be done under the <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/02102017/meat-eating-grass-fed-beef-climate-change-cattle/">right conditions</a>, which are rare; climate gains are reversible — stored carbon can be released if a rancher changes their practices; and carbon sequestration rates diminish over time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And there’s another catch. Even assuming that cattle grazing under the right conditions can sequester and store lots of carbon, regenerative ranching requires more land. A lot more — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2022/10/03/beef-soil-carbon-sequestration/">2 times</a> to <a href="https://civileats.com/2021/01/06/a-new-study-on-regenerative-grazing-complicates-climate-optimism/">2.5 times</a> that of conventional ranching. Currently, cattle are grazed on over <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-us-land-use/?embedded-checkout=true#xj4y7vzkg">one-third</a> of US land, so it stands to reason that switching even a modest share of the US beef cattle herd to regenerative would cause a massive spike in land demand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Regenerative agriculture is important, but you cannot produce the amount of meat we do now regeneratively, because there just simply isn&#8217;t enough land,” said <a href="https://madrebrava.org/pages/about">Sarah Lake</a>, a longtime food and climate activist and now CEO of PlantWorks, a new philanthropy focused on shifting diets. This is especially true in light of rising meat production: The USDA projects a nearly <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDA-Agricultural-Projections-to-2033.pdf">15 percent increase</a> in both beef and overall meat production over the next decade.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2021/aug/30/its-not-the-cow-its-the-how-why-a-long-time-vegetarian-became-beefs-biggest-champion">It’s not the cow, it’s the how</a>,” is a common refrain from the regenerative beef crowd. Cows aren’t a pollution problem, they claim — it’s how they’re farmed that’s the problem. But there is no escaping the fact that it <em>is</em> the cow, and especially the number of cows — and pigs and chickens.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://animal.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/Paris-compliant-livestock-report.pdf">survey</a> of more than 200 climate and agricultural scientists released earlier this year, experts said global livestock emissions must peak and then fall rapidly in the coming years. By far the most effective way to do that, experts agreed, is to raise and consume fewer animals. High- and middle-income countries — which eat much more meat than the global average — must lead the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Soil carbon sequestration, the main selling point of regenerative agriculture, ranked second to last.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Technology can’t make meat and dairy climate-friendly</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Regenerative agriculture represents one side of the meat and dairy industries’ apparent efforts to delay climate action and rebrand themselves as sustainable. The other side entails a suite of technologies aimed at directly reducing livestock emissions. Often, the industry will combine the two approaches into one project.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One example comes from the <a href="https://www.usdairy.com/sustainability/environmental-sustainability/net-zero-initiative">US Dairy Net Zero Initiative</a>, which was launched by an industry research and marketing organization in 2020. The plan purports that the dairy industry can reach net zero emissions, or carbon neutrality, <a href="https://www.dairyherd.com/news/business/dairy-industry-unveils-net-zero-initiative-2050">by 2050</a>, and it’s received support from <a href="https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/files/Publication/file/570hr7ghl5_Net_Zero_Dairy_Business_Case_v10.pdf?_ga=2.47302575.982671617.1711666071-297121572.1711666071">WWF</a>, <a href="https://business.edf.org/insights/innovative-new-financing-models-help-dairy-companies-slash-methane-emissions/">Environmental Defense Fund</a>, and <a href="https://www.usdairy.com/media/press-releases/syngenta-nature-conservancy-partner-with-us-dairy-to-advance-net-zero-initiative">the Nature Conservancy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local">Dairy products</a>, just like beef, also generate far more greenhouse gas emissions than most food products. For example, the carbon footprint of cow’s milk is around <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impact-milks">three times</a> that of various plant-based milks. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/VNT11-the-carbon-footprint-of-cow-s-milk-is-about-three-times-that-of-plant-based-milk.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,7.5121296017105,100,84.975740796579" alt="A chart shows that the carbon footprint of cow’s milk is about three times that of a plant-based milk." title="A chart shows that the carbon footprint of cow’s milk is about three times that of a plant-based milk." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The industry’s claim that it can achieve carbon neutrality was bolstered by a 2021 WWF <a href="https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/files/Publication/file/570hr7ghl5_Net_Zero_Dairy_Business_Case_v10.pdf?_ga=2.47302575.982671617.1711666071-297121572.1711666071">white paper</a>, which outlines how some large US dairy farms could reach net zero emissions — or even be carbon-negative — not by 2050, but astonishingly, within just five years. The organization says it could be achieved by farms using a mix of regenerative practices and new technologies, like changing cows’ genetics and feed so they burp out less methane, and “biodigester” machines, which capture methane from animal manure and convert it into usable energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, such machines have been popping up on factory farms across the country, built in part with <a href="https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Factory-Farm-Gas-Brief_final-0312.pdf">taxpayer dollars</a>. Critics say the benefits are <a href="https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Factory-Farm-Gas-Brief_final-v2.pdf">overstated</a> and that they stand to further <a href="https://hoards.com/article-30925-energy-revenue-could-be-a-game-changer-for-dairy-farms.html">enrich</a>, <a href="https://thefern.org/2021/12/biogas-from-americas-favorite-meat-pollution-solution-or-a-prop-for-poultry/">entrench</a>, and <a href="https://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Factory-Farm-Gas-Brief_final.pdf">expand</a> factory farming.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The science is clear that, while some mitigation can be achieved by improving meat and dairy production, climate-neutral or zero-emissions meat and dairy is not a possibility in the foreseeable future,” said Hayek, the New York University environmental studies professor, speaking about net-zero claims in animal agriculture broadly, not the WWF report specifically.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/experts/jason-clay">Jason Clay</a>, senior vice president of markets for WWF and author of the report, said in an email that he doesn’t disagree with this statement. The paper, he noted, models what’s possible “if we had the right conditions in place — that includes government incentives, corporate investment, and commitment across the dairy supply chain.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of what’s possible relies on those government incentives&nbsp;— subsidies or regulatory changes that are favorable to industry. These recur frequently in the paper, which illustrates a fundamental aspect of animal agriculture’s business model. Over the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">last century</a>, states and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/357195/land-grant-universities-greenwashing-climate-methane-factory-farming">federal government</a> have poured money into building the factory farming system while slashing its <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">environmental regulations</a>. By <a href="http://www.greyclark.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/US-Subsidies-Post-2014-Farm-Bill-FEB-2018.pdf">one estimate</a>, subsidies cover almost half of dairy farmers’ production costs. Now, industry can only clean up the mess it&#8217;s made of our air, climate, and water if taxpayers cover the bill.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the supposed net-zero solutions in the WWF paper rest on shaky science, like regenerative agriculture practices, while others seem far-fetched. For example, a significant amount of the emissions reduction detailed in the paper relies on farms not just turning manure into energy, but their communities’ food waste too. A small number of <a href="https://civileats.com/2023/08/28/these-manure-digesters-incorporate-food-scraps-does-that-make-them-better/">dairy farms</a> already do this, but expanding the practice to the country’s thousands of large dairy farms would require a range of policy changes and <a href="https://agdatanews.substack.com/p/whats-worth-more-a-cows-milk-or-its?r=i2qe&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;triedRedirect=true">inefficient subsidies</a>, not to mention the complex logistics of trucking heavy food waste from population centers to rural mega-dairies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you remove just this one practice from the paper, the imaginary net-zero dairy farm is no longer net-zero.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The paper has been cited <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/19/10535">numerous</a> <a href="https://blog.usdec.org/usdairyexporter/5-facts-showing-us-dairys-commitment-to-sustainability-on-world-milk-day-0">times</a> by the US Dairy Net Zero Initiative, which has called it an “<a href="https://www.usdairy.com/getmedia/38d5cbdf-c605-4a38-b520-f7ec1e1c5cd8/Dairy-Sustainability-Alliance-Newsletter-Spring-2021.pdf?ext=.pdf">independent review</a>,” even though the findings were informed by data from the industry trade group behind the initiative — Dairy Management Inc (DMI). According to WWF documents, DMI gave WWF $125,000 to $250,000 from 2017 to 2019. A DMI spokesperson said its funding to WWF was for “services,” not as donations. This funding began in 2011, the DMI spokesperson said, but declined to share the amount given from then to 2017.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Clay said that several pilot farms have “effectively achieved&#8221; net zero emissions and when asked for details on the claim, a WWF spokesperson referred Vox to DMI. A DMI spokesperson confirmed there are pilot farm studies underway but did not comment on whether they had achieved net zero emissions. “The pilots will help demonstrate how a commercial farm can feasibly progress toward neutrality,” the spokesperson said, but “it is not expected that all farms will reach neutrality.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To be sure, over time the US has managed to produce <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378018306101#sec0085">meat</a> and <a href="https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/comparing-life-cycle-greenhouse-gas-emissions-dairy-pork-systems_0.pdf">dairy</a> with fewer emissions per kilogram of food than many countries. But those emissions savings haven’t kept up with rising meat and dairy consumption, which has contributed to a steady increase in US agricultural emissions, even as total emissions from energy and transport have fallen.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Each of the technological fixes in development from industry certainly hold some potential to further <a href="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads.thebreakthrough.org/Clean-Cow-Report_v6.pdf">reduce</a>, albeit marginally, meat and dairy’s climate impact. But even that measured improvement can only be achieved if the farming practices and technologies work, farmers are offered generous subsidies and regulatory tweaks to adopt them, and they’re fully deployed throughout the industry’s complex supply chains.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonetheless, EDF and WWF have championed some of them as <a href="https://business.edf.org/insights/danone-commits-to-cut-dairy-methane-emissions-in-partnership-with-farmers-and-edf/">critical</a> climate <a href="https://files.worldwildlife.org/wwfcmsprod/files/Publication/file/3f7fxakan2_Solutions_to_Meet_the_Need_for_Feed_Final_032223.pdf">solutions</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">EDF and the Nature Conservancy are also <a href="https://agclimatealliance.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/98/files/2023/02/farm-bill-recommendations.pdf">founding members</a> of <a href="https://agclimatealliance.com/members/">the Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance</a>, a coalition of meat, dairy, and agricultural trade groups, many of which lobby aggressively to block environmental policy. But the alliance is a vehicle for their other goal on Capitol Hill: ramping up subsidies for regenerative agriculture and technological solutions.<strong> </strong>It’s similar to how the fossil fuel industry <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17082021/carbon-capture-storage-fossil-fuel-companies-climate/">lobbies</a> to both block climate regulations and subsidize <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/10/09/carbon-capture-oil-gas/">carbon capture</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the other founding members is the American Farm Bureau Federation, which one former Republican Senate staffer has described as the <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24102018/farm-bureau-climate-change-denial-farmers-crop-insurance-subsidies-drought-future-at-risk/">NRA of agriculture</a>. The organization <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24102018/farm-bureau-climate-change-denial-farmers-crop-insurance-subsidies-drought-future-at-risk/">fights climate action</a>, <a href="https://www.fb.org/issue/energy#:~:text=Conventional%20Energy,the%20use%20of%20hydraulic%20fracturing.">supports</a> fossil fuel expansion, and as recently as a decade ago <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-farmers-do-not-believe-in-climate-change/">argued</a> that humans aren’t responsible for climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We don’t expect to see eye-to-eye with our partners on every issue,” said Ben Thomas, senior director of agriculture policy at EDF, in an email. “We find where there is common ground, and we work to make joint progress there.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Nature Conservancy didn’t respond directly to several detailed questions about its work with companies and industry trade groups, but said in part that the organization recognizes that “dairy or livestock systems cannot easily achieve carbon neutrality only through emissions reductions,” but that “significant emission reductions are possible and worth supporting.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">TNC and EDF also belong to other industry coalitions, like the <a href="https://midwestrowcrop.org/our-model/members/">Midwest Row Crop Collaborative</a> and <a href="https://fieldtomarket.org/">Field to Market</a>, a nonprofit whose membership is dominated by industry.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, EDF helped launch — at a UN climate summit, no less — a new alliance between several major dairy companies that have agreed to report their methane emissions but, critically, aren’t <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/global-dairy-companies-announce-alliance-cut-methane-cop28-2023-12-05/">required to pledge</a> to reduce those emissions by a certain amount.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some in the meat business are paying close attention. Late last year, the chief strategist of the trade association the Meat Institute <a href="https://www.feedstuffs.com/agribusiness-news/cop28-agreement-what-might-it-mean-for-the-feed-and-meat-industries-">said</a> his industry should consider similar partnerships with nonprofits at future climate summits to “advance solutions together and really bring that proof to the table” that it’s taking climate action.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked Environmental Defense Fund for specifics on its goals to reduce animal agriculture emissions, how it’ll measure progress, and what progress it has made so far, I was directed to a <a href="https://www.edf.org/vision-2030">website</a> that shows the organization aims to, by 2030, “help the land and oceans feed us, so 2.5 billion people benefit from climate-resilient, equitable food systems globally.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s a lofty aspiration, but it’s unclear what it means and how their work will help achieve it. When I followed up for more detail, the organization didn’t provide any.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The organization also wants to reduce global methane pollution by 40 percent to 45 percent by 2030 and has been actively working to reduce the harmful gas for years, including launching an <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/04032024/new-edf-harvard-satellite-will-monitor-methane-emissions-worldwide/">impressive satellite</a> to track it. It’s essential work, as methane accounts for about <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022/methane-and-climate-change#">one-third</a> of global warming since the Industrial Revolution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the use of EDF’s satellite to address emissions from livestock, which <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane">domestically</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Estimated-global-anthropogenic-methane-emissions-by-source-2020_fig1_341017757">globally</a> spew more methane than oil and gas, will be limited. The organization <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240306-agricultural-methane-is-a-climate-action-blind-spot">says</a> there are fewer oil and gas operations than farms, which makes oil and gas a more manageable target, and that oil and gas operators have more resources to tackle the problem. (There are also some technical challenges to tracking livestock methane with EDF’s satellite.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the current EDF employees I spoke with said that the organization’s solely technological approach to livestock methane is “rooted in a pessimism that more ambitious change isn’t possible,” which becomes something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The organization believes that people won’t change their diets, the employee said, so technological solutions are the best it can do. “But focusing on methane at the expense of systemic change turns our institutional pessimism into reality.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elizabeth Sturcken, managing director of business at EDF, said over email that in the US “there are no prospects” for companies, especially in food and agriculture, to be required through regulation to reduce methane emissions. “Voluntary corporate action can help fill in this gap.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked WWF about its goals related to agriculture, I was told the organization aims to reduce the climate, water pollution, and biodiversity impacts of animal protein in the US by a staggering 50 percent by 2030 against 2005 levels. The goal, the organization says, will be achieved through the adoption of “responsibly sourced, regeneratively produced cattle, poultry, swine, and aquaculture [fish farm] products.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After repeated requests for details on how it would measure this goal and its progress so far, a spokesperson said, “We are in the process of revising and finalizing our long-term goals to ensure they are measurable. As part of this process we are examining what is possible to track, in what regions we are working, and how to set baselines in animal protein systems.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No one I interviewed for this story believes environmental groups shouldn’t engage with the private sector. Quite the contrary. However, these organizations’ relationships appear to have a narrowing effect, in which they work with the industry on projects that the industry is comfortable taking on, rather than what is needed to meet global climate targets or&nbsp;slash pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">WWF’s Bonini said as much: “We encourage companies to work on all fronts, particularly where they can have the biggest impact, but ultimately how they choose to address these impacts is up to them. And from there we work with companies to set goals and drive down negative impacts.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As one of the current EDF employees I spoke to put it, “EDF provides cover for businesses by letting them set their own ambition.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But systemic change is hard, and through such collaborations the organizations get to show their donors what appears to be a win, said Secchi, the University of Iowa sustainability professor. Pennington, the former WWF lead scientist, said that for the corporations,“the biggest benefit with partnering with these large [nonprofits] is having your name, having your logos together on the same document.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, Sturcken of EDF said in an <a href="https://civileats.com/2023/11/15/walmart-and-edf-forged-an-unlikely-partnership-17-years-later-whats-changed/">interview</a> with the news outlet Civil Eats that “PR benefits” were one of the benefits to businesses embracing food sustainability.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This line of work with corporations may also have a silencing effect.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">WWF-UK <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/02/wwf-shelved-report-exposing-river-wye-pollution-to-keep-tesco-happy">canceled</a> the publication of a report in which one of its corporate donors at the time — Tesco, the British grocery giant — was implicated in chicken farming pollution. WWF-UK told the Guardian the report did not meet its “rigorous standards” and that the decision was not connected to its corporate relationship. WWF-UK <a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/who-we-are/who-we-work-with/tesco">ended</a> its formal partnership with Tesco in 2023, though they continue to collaborate. (Notably, a former Tesco CEO is the <a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/about/how-we-are-governed">chair</a> of WWF-UK’s board of trustees.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I don’t think that it creates a conflict of interest,” said Bonini of WWF when asked about its corporate donations in general — not about Tesco specifically. “We’ve seen a lot of positive momentum working and collaborating with companies, but we continue to push them. That’s our job. And if we don&#8217;t see them making progress, we will walk away.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Wherever your funding comes from has an effect on your work, and to say anything else is insanity at this point,” said <a href="https://jenniferjacquet.com/">Jennifer Jacquet</a>, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami and author of a book on greenwashing, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534048/the-playbook-by-jennifer-jacquet/"><em>The Playbook</em></a>. “Greenwashing serves a lot of purposes. It’s not just about [preventing] regulation — that’s always part of it. But it’s about maintaining the social license to operate … the economic license, the moral license.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sometimes, industry players will say that quiet part out loud. In a 2022 <a href="https://perma.cc/7Z89-LZD8">news release</a> issued by a cattle breeding association about a project to change cattle genetics to lower their emissions, an industry-aligned academic said “This is going to help us maintain the license to operate. I think that is a key term we all need to understand.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“Making conservation easy, one burger at a time”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to working with companies, some groups also have extensive programs designed to persuade individual ranchers to take up regenerative practices.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The National Audubon Society, the beloved bird conservancy organization, rewards regenerative ranchers with its seal of approval in the form of a label that reads “Grazed on bird friendly land” and “Audubon certified.” Such beef can be purchased at about 250 retail and online stores.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">WWF has a <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/pages/ranch-systems-and-viability-planning-rsvp#:~:text=To%20date%2C%20WWF%20has%20enrolled,Wyoming%20and%20the%20Nebraska%20Sandhills.">similar program</a> with 90 ranches enrolled, though with no certification or marketing scheme. The organization <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/world-wildlife-fund-joins-the-walmart-foundation-cargill-mcdonald-s-to-launch-million-acre-grazing-initiative-to-help-restore-grasslands-address-climate-change">launched</a> it with $6 million from McDonald’s, Cargill, and the Walmart Foundation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Nature Conservancy owns 500,000 acres of grazing land, which it uses to run experiments and demonstrate to ranchers how they can adopt regenerative grazing plans. Ultimately, it wants to see <a href="https://www.nature.org/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/documents/SustainableGrazing_Factsheet_022420_FINAL.pdf">240 million acres</a> — about the size of Texas and Colorado combined — under regenerative grazing plans by 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/who-we-are/our-people/rob-manes/">Rob Manes</a>, the group’s co-director of North American regenerative grazing lands strategy, said the Nature Conservancy doesn’t yet have details on what metrics it will use to assess how its regenerative grazing plans, when enacted, help the environment. But he’s confident it will work: “We know that those plans will result in greater biodiversity, better water quality, and in some places increased soil carbon.” He said measuring ecological change can be slow and that it’s “difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to measure those things over millions and millions of acres.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the time being, he said, “we find ourselves sometimes measuring effort.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-565993869.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,5.5740170195941,100,88.851965960812" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Cowboys round up cattle on the 15,000 acre Tollhouse Ranch in Caliente, California, which is owned by the Nature Conservancy.  " data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Jonathan Foley, an environmental scientist and executive director of the climate research group Project Drawdown, said the regenerative narrative that nature can heal much of livestock’s environmental impact has political and cultural power that is as significant as it is distorting. Scenes of cattle grazing in beautiful grasslands and interviews with humble farmers can be highly effective propaganda: It’s “Americana,” and “the apple pie and the flag all rolled into one,” he said. “It’s a very powerful set of symbols” — one that the meat industry has used to its benefit, with help from some of the world&#8217;s most powerful environmental groups.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also prevents us from asking “hard questions about diets, subsidies, and political power within the food system,” he said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth noting that a couple of the largest green organizations, like Earthjustice, go up against the industry, but they <a href="https://earthjustice.org/feature/what-you-need-to-know-about-earthjustice">appear</a> to devote <a href="https://earthjustice.org/office/sustainable-food-farming">disproportionately few</a> resources to it. The Natural Resources Defense Council once did, but it’s now focused on <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/issues/agriculture-food#overview">regenerative agriculture</a> and declined to answer detailed questions about its related goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others, like Greenpeace US, don’t challenge the industry or advocate for shifting diets at all — though some of its chapters in other countries do, as do <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVpYTNQKAE_izp8tsVK3tQ4fNWPgoQIz/view">some</a> of <a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/our-reports/plant-based-alternatives-technical">WWF’s</a>. Bonini of WWF told me that the organization “has had success in the UK with retailers focusing on sustainable diets” and that it’s looking into how it could adapt that work for the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just how hard it is to move environmental organizations on meat was made clear to me by someone who has been deeply involved in one of the oldest and biggest green groups in the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Todd Shuman has been a <a href="https://vault.sierraclub.org/planet/200105/victory.asp">devoted</a> Sierra Club volunteer, holding leadership positions on various committees for almost 15 years. He got involved in the 1990s when the organization was campaigning to stop cattle grazing in national parks and other public lands. But he’s slowly become disillusioned with the Club’s resistance to taking on Big Meat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shuman’s frustration has reached a boiling point in recent years, as he and some like-minded members have tried and failed to pass two proposals centered on animal agriculture. (Unlike most nonprofits, the Sierra Club is highly democratic and volunteers can have some influence in setting organizational policy.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’ve been trying to prod the Club to act politically,” Shuman said. “Take on this industry! Challenge this industry!”&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/imagejpeg_1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Their first proposal entailed getting the Sierra Club to endorse and advocate for what Shuman calls a federal methane cap and fee policy, which would set a cap on methane emissions for polluters — including those in the livestock industry —&nbsp; and require them to pay for each ton of methane emitted. It’s a classic “<a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-is-the-polluter-pays-principle/">polluters pay</a>” policy, and the Biden administration has proposed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/01/12/methane-fee-epa-climate/">similar regulations</a> for the oil and gas sector, but not the livestock sector, even though it emits <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane">more methane</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A council of representatives from regional and state chapters passed Shuman’s resolution in September 2022 and it was then kicked up to a high-level internal committee. That committee declined to endorse the resolution and never voted on it, which Shuman considered a rejection — and one that he believes was made largely out of fear of political backlash. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, he and others wanted to revise the organization’s <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/policy/agriculture/food">agriculture and food policy</a> to emphasize the need to reduce meat and dairy consumption and remove language that Shuman and others felt uncritically promoted regenerative cattle grazing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The proposal has been tabled indefinitely, Shuman said, which he thinks is because some in Sierra Club leadership strongly believe that regenerative agriculture is a critical environmental solution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Sierra Club declined to comment on Shuman’s efforts, but <a href="https://www.sierraclub.org/farm-bill-2023">shared information</a> about a few federal bills the organization has endorsed in recent years that challenge the factory farming system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you can’t get the Sierra Club to [support a methane tax], how the fuck are you going to get anyone else in society to do that?” Shuman told me in exasperation. “If your environmental organizations — that people expect to kind of lead on this — are too scared to do that, what hope is there for our species on this planet?”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why meat is the third rail of public and personal politics </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shuman’s belief that the Sierra Club shies away from taking on the meat industry due to fear of political backlash — fears that seem to come into play much less when environmental groups take on fossil fuels — was something I heard throughout my conversations for this story.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I posed this analysis to leaders of large environmental nonprofits, they mostly told me that while they agree people in the Global North need to eat less meat, working on policy to change diets or stop factory farming just doesn’t align with their organizations’ strengths or theory of change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We started as a land trust — buying and managing land — and really, that&#8217;s kind of the heart of what the Nature Conservancy does,” said Wironen. Reducing meat consumption “is not something that we as an organization really have a comparative advantage in.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When asked why Environmental Defense Fund doesn’t have any programmatic work on shifting diets in the Global North, Anderson said: “While consumer behavior changes can be part of the path to lower food emissions, banking our climate future on that alone isn’t practical.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/experts/melissa-d-ho/stories">Melissa D. Ho</a>, senior vice president for freshwater and food at WWF-US, stressed the value of being “a middle-of-the-road organization” that can “try to bring disparate voices together,” like agriculture groups, meat producers, food companies, and Republicans and Democrats.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, not every organization can take up every issue, and social movements need a multitude of tactics and approaches to succeed. But when most of the environmental movement feels that going up against Big Meat doesn’t fit with their mission, we’re left with one of our most ecologically destructive industries largely unchallenged by a movement that purportedly exists to stop ecological destruction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a given in the environmental community that governments and corporations need to phase out — or at least drastically reduce — fossil fuel production. Despite scientific consensus that significant changes to the Western world’s meat and dairy production are necessary to meet global climate targets, few environmentalists are willing to go there.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no doubt it would be a difficult, even toxic fight. In Europe, which has long been more ambitious than the US on climate policy, farmers have <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24146466/europe-farmer-protests-eu-climate-environmental-policy-subsidies-livestock">protested en masse</a> against policies designed to cut livestock pollution. In the US and elsewhere, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/171781/meat-culture-war-crickets">conservatives</a> have begun taking up <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/08/the-peterson-family-meat-cleanse/567613/">meat</a> as a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bjazz3/a-brief-history-of-conservatives-using-tofu-eating-as-an-insult?callback=in&amp;code=MWM1OGQ4OTKTMTGYNI0ZNDYYLWJMODQTOTEZOTFKY2ZMZDGY&amp;state=acb67b499b7a4f3e90a862b02568f503">cause célèbre</a> of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/4/26/22403599/biden-red-meat-ban-burger-kudlow">culture war</a>. Even <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/8/24151435/john-fetterman-lab-grown-cultivated-meat-ron-desantis-florida-ban">liberals</a> occasionally join in, and only a handful of members of Congress can be counted on to introduce legislation to regulate factory farms or increase access to plant-based food.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some politicians paint calls to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/11/18/23458234/jim-pillen-governor-nebraska-pigs-pork-plant-based-meat-water-pollution-nitrates">stop pollution</a> from factory farms and eat more plant-based meals as anti-farmer, a potent charge given both farming’s close association with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">America’s national mythos</a> and the disproportionate political power that rural states hold. Farmers have also been continually characterized as stewards of the land, rather than business people capable of significant pollution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These narratives have been used by the industry in a very skillful manner,” Secchi said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They’ve <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/magazine/issues/winter-2019/articles/stewards-of-the-prairies">certainly</a> <a href="https://blogs.edf.org/growingreturns/2022/10/14/farmers-see-value-in-agriculture-loans-that-reward-stewardship/">influenced</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTqV2jDQ_Ao">some</a> <a href="https://audubonactionfund.org/news/recently-passed-federal-funding-package-makes-investments-in-natural-climate-solutions">environmental groups</a> and leaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[Livestock groups] are very sensitive to feeling criticized and demonized, and understandably so, because when you hear things like ‘meat is evil’ &#8230; I think they feel that their whole identity is being attacked,” Ho of WWF-US said. “They don’t feel that people appreciate the hard work and toil that they do to grow food to feed people … it really cuts to the bone and they take it personally and I understand why.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet even while environmentalists recognize the fraught politics of challenging Big Meat, some believe it is nevertheless essential.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The planet doesn’t care what is politically tenable and what&#8217;s good on Fox News and what Twitter bots will come after you for,” said Foley. “Why do [environmentalists] keep on waving the white flag before we even fight the battle on this issue?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sarah Lake, CEO of the philanthropy organization PlantWorks, is worried about how conflict-avoidant environmental groups are on the matter: “They bring the clout, the reputation, the ability to pivot an entire field, and them not being willing to [call for] meat reduction is quite problematic.”’</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also the uncomfortable fact of personal habits. Being an environmentalist doesn’t require being a vegan, but several people I talked to speculated that environmentalists may not care to change America’s relationship to meat because they’re unwilling to change themselves.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-1160294625.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,31.917539267016,100,36.164921465969" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Greenpeace activists in Geneva, Switzerland, hold a banner during a protest prior to the United Nations’ publication of a special report on climate change and land in 2019. | Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“People have told me about their [organization’s] leaders not willing to eat the vegan meal and going out and getting a steak or whatever,” one longtime activist told me, requesting anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the issue in the environmental movement. “I hear stories and I just think, ‘That’s like a person working on renewable energy and driving a Hummer.’ … If we can’t change ourselves in the environmental community, then how would we expect to change the general population?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many environmentalists have come to criticize individual action as ineffectual and naive. The burden to mitigate climate change and pollution falls on politicians and corporations, <a href="https://time.com/5669071/lifestyle-changes-climate-change/">they argue</a>, not the average person. Leading climate voices, such as Michael Mann and David Wallace-Wells, have even <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/159153/climate-change-dismiss-meat-emissions-wrong">dismissed</a> meat reduction as “virtue signaling” and a “cop-out.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, policy change is the only route through which we can overcome the enormity of the climate and ecological crises we ourselves have created. But policy change requires public support. It’s hard to see how politicians — aside from a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/8/21311327/farmers-factory-farms-cafos-animal-rights-booker-warren-khanna">brave few</a> — will stick their neck out to push for significant meat industry reforms if even environmentalists are disinterested in shifting social norms around meat consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The idea that environmentalists shouldn’t try to influence how people eat “is a win for industry … It’s their script,” said Jacquet, the University of Miami professor. Environmentalists who repeat this, she added, have “become sock puppets for industry, and they don’t even mean to be.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A second current EDF employee I spoke to, who would only speak on condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said when they brought up these issues internally, they were told that people’s diets are private. But, the employee told me, “it’s not private if it&#8217;s affecting everyone&#8217;s air and water.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some <a href="https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/food-agriculture-environment/eat-meat-not-too-much">environmentalists</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/choosing-chicken-over-beef-cuts-carbon-footprint-surprising-amount">journalists</a> will encourage people to simply swap their beef for chicken, as chicken has a <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/food-choice-vs-eating-local">lower carbon footprint</a> — about 10 percent that of beef’s. Vox obtained a copy of an internal Environmental Defense Fund policy that bars employees from purchasing meat from ruminant animals — cattle, sheep, and goats — at EDF offices and events due to their high carbon footprints, but says nothing of other meats, like chicken. Poultry production, however, comes with its own set of nasty <a href="https://environmentalintegrity.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Chesapeake-Poultry-Report-.pdf">air</a> and <a href="https://mediahub.unc.edu/nobodys-listening-nc-department-of-environmental-quality-fails-to-regulate-water-and-air-pollution-from-poultry-farming/">water</a> pollution <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/4/20993654/chicken-beef-climate-environment-factory-farms">problems</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We try to be very conscious of the environmental impact of our operations,” an EDF spokesperson said, when asked about the environmental impact of other animal products. “That policy is still being drafted, and we don&#8217;t have any more detail for you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pete Smith, a <a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/14907/">leading climate scientist</a>, warns against the “swap beef for chicken” advice because poultry production also requires a significant amount of farmland to grow corn and soy to feed the birds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They’re eating products that are grown on land that could be growing food for humans instead, so it’s still a really inefficient thing to do to swap out ruminant [beef, lamb, goat] products for other different types of meat,” Smith told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Considering that much of the environmental movement also cares deeply about animal life, it’s worth noting that perhaps no farmed species is treated worse than chickens raised for <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21437054/chickens-factory-farming-animal-cruelty-welfare">meat</a>. The birds’ genetics have been <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21437054/chickens-factory-farming-animal-cruelty-welfare">significantly altered</a> to make them grow bigger and faster, which in turn has reduced their carbon footprint. But it’s come at a severe cost to their welfare; their legs cannot handle the rapid growth of their breasts, making it difficult for many chickens to walk or even stand.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/FosterFarmsGeneralFacilities12.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.1121349063185,100,93.775730187363" alt="A room packed with chickens." title="A room packed with chickens." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Chickens on a US factory farm. | Mercy For Animals" data-portal-copyright="Mercy For Animals" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, EDF and WWF are founding members of the industry coalition <a href="http://us-rspe.org/">US Roundtable for Sustainable Poultry &amp; Eggs</a>, which <a href="https://www.us-rspe.org/resources/docs/2022-US-RSPE-Framework-Metrics-and-Indicators.pdf">encourages</a> chicken producers to use “genetics” — among other things — to make animals more productive. While these organizations work to protect wild animals, they approve of one of the most abusive practices inflicted on domesticated animals.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Britt Groosman, vice president of climate-smart agriculture for EDF, didn’t directly answer a question about the greenhouse gas and animal cruelty tradeoff, but said in an email: “It’s important that progress on one issue doesn’t exacerbate another issue, and we need to be thoughtful about solutions to environmental challenges.” WWF didn’t respond to a question about its involvement in the poultry roundtable.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where the environmental movement might go from here</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While our food choices are personal and guided by our preferences, they’ve also been heavily shaped by policy, and so the few environmental groups that do challenge the meat industry spend little if any of their resources trying to tell people how to eat. Instead, they’re working the system to hold factory farms accountable for pollution and to make our food environment — cafeterias, grocery stores, restaurants — more sustainable. And some of the work they’re doing demonstrates that change is possible, if only more of their peers would join them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Making it easier for consumers to choose plant-based options “comes by changing the policy context,” Lake said. It’s analogous to efforts to make it easier for consumers to choose electric vehicles or heat pumps and solar panels — key parts of President Biden’s landmark climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, the policy landscape is tipped heavily in favor of meat and dairy production. There is publicly funded <a href="https://farm.ewg.org/cropinsurance.php">animal feed crop insurance</a>, <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/animal-production-and-protection/food-animal-production/">meat and dairy R&amp;D</a>, and a sprawling set of <a href="https://agr.mt.gov/News/USDA-Makes-More-Grants-Available-for-Meat-and-Poultry-Processors-Aug-2023">grants</a> and <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28092022/usda-conservation-funding-climate-smart-agriculture/">programs</a> for producers, as well as a number of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">regulatory loopholes</a> that allow farmers and companies to pollute with few consequences. A <a href="https://www.cell.com/one-earth/pdf/S2590-3322(23)00347-0.pdf">2023 analysis</a> published in the journal <em>One Earth</em> found that<strong>, </strong>from 2014 to 2020, the US meat industry received about 800 times more government funding than did meat and dairy alternatives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot can be done to tip the scale in the other direction, and in ways unlikely to spur political backlash.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Europe, the environmental community has contributed significantly to building a more plant-based food system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23627509/netherlands-dairy-cow-protests-seeds-farming-agriculture-climate">the Netherlands</a>, a government environmental advisory board has pushed the country to pursue transitioning 20 percent of its protein consumption from animal sources to plant-based by 2030. It could be working: Meat consumption <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/research-results/research-institutes/economic-research/show-wecr/meat-report-2023-meat-consumption-has-dropped-further-in-2022.htm#:~:text=The%20total%20per%20capita%20consumption,reported%20consumption%20figure%20since%202005.">fell modestly</a> in the years that followed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231201-denmark-the-major-meat-producer-switching-to-a-plant-based-diet">Denmark</a> has been the most ambitious, setting aside nearly $200 million USD to work with chefs, food businesses, farmers, and more to shift diets and expand organic food production. The plan was crafted by a diverse coalition of interests, including both environmental and farming groups. That diversity helped build political will.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The country is even on the cusp of enacting the world’s first <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/06/27/denmark-carbon-tax-cows/">carbon tax on meat</a>, which was negotiated between a center-right government, farmers, meat industry representatives, and labor unions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What these accomplishments have in common is that environmental groups were willing to grab the third rail of politics. None of these groups in the US or Europe advocate for removing meat from menus altogether or curtailing consumer choice, but they do want to level the radically uneven playing field on which animal-based and plant-based foods compete.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent decades, the US movement to protect farmed animals from cruelty — which, in full disclosure, I took part in prior to joining Vox — has won political and corporate campaigns that also show it’s possible to reform the factory farming industry. Those include banning some of the cruelest farming practices, like tiny cages for <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22331708/eggs-cages-chickens-hens-meat-poultry">hens</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23745935/proposition-12-pigs-pork-california-eggs-veal-hens">pigs</a>, in <a href="https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/HSUS_state-farm-animal-protection-laws.pdf">over a dozen states</a> and working with <a href="https://us.sodexo.com/media/news-releases/sodexo-campus-plant-based-menu.html">large food companies</a> to serve <a href="https://www.aramark.com/newsroom/news/2022/increasing-plant-based-menu-offerings-on-college-campuses">more plant-based meals</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That movement has a mere <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/645be31efb5e013b9c6f4751/t/64cb9a7bb5b56917db63457a/1691064968896/FAF+State+of+the+Movement+Report+2021.pdf">$91 million</a> annual budget. Much more might be possible if the US environmental movement, with an <a href="https://carbonswitch.com/analysis-of-environmental-giving/">$8 billion</a> budget — 88 times larger — were more engaged in the fight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;ll be the first to admit that reforming the US food system so it’s less reliant on animal products won’t be easy. Through a decade of advocacy, and now several years as a journalist on the beat, I’ve seen firsthand how resistant many Americans are to change on this issue, and the immense power agribusiness holds over Congress and in state legislatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s certainly far more difficult than the push for clean energy, and one that will take far longer to yield progress. People can’t tell whether their home runs on solar power or coal — as long as it flows, an electron is an electron — while food preferences are personal and influenced by culture, tradition, advertising, social norms, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But over the last 15 years, more environmental advocates have been able to cross the Rubicon to confront Big Meat, and Faber of the Environmental Working Group said the movement is increasingly turning toward environmental challenges posed by agriculture.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s critical they get it right. Foley, the climate scientist, is concerned that a lot of the energy to reform agriculture is headed in the wrong direction by overinvesting in the regenerative approach: “I worry that we might lose years and decades pursuing what is kind of a bit of a fairy-tale solution, or at least highly exaggerated as the silver bullet solution, for all climate change issues in food.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Unfortunately, environmental groups depend on large philanthropies, so I wouldn’t put all of the blame at the feet of the environmental groups,” said <a href="https://mightyearth.org/person/glenn-hurowitz/">Glenn Hurowitz</a>, founder and CEO of Mighty Earth, which campaigns against meat companies implicated in deforestation. “There’s not very many funders focused on food and agriculture in general. It is hard to raise money for our agricultural work, especially in the United States.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One major exception is the Bezos Earth Fund, which has committed <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-28/global-food-roundup-jeff-bezos-quest-for-alternative-meat">$100 million</a> to fund research into alternative meat technologies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such works matters: Several people I spoke with felt that the emergence of better plant-based meat and dairy products over the last few years — despite <a href="https://gfi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2023-State-of-the-industry-report_Plant-based.pdf">stagnating sales</a> — has served as an opening for some organizations and funders to think about the issue differently, offering a less politically risky approach than antagonizing industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That approach — along with redesigning <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/companies-and-schools-are-using-nudge-theory-to-cut-meat-consumption">cafeterias</a>, <a href="https://www.wri.org/update/menu-messaging-increase-sales-climate-friendly-food">restaurant menus</a>, and <a href="https://plantbasedfoods.org/pbfa-kroger-plant-based-meat-store-test">grocery store shelves</a> to be more climate-friendly — may be most palatable in the near future to funders and other powerful stakeholders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But considering the public’s limited understanding of meat’s environmental and social harms — and the companies inflicting them on society — we’ll also need old-fashioned public awareness campaigns to build political support for reform.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Currently, there’s only political upside for environmental groups to ignore the problem or solely advocate for solutions that the industry is amenable to making. And there’s only political downside to campaigning against industry. Until that calculus changes, it’s hard to see how good policy could advance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It needs to be a political liability to choose false solutions over effective climate policies,” said <a href="https://takeextinctionoffyourplate.com/about-us">Jennifer Molidor</a>, a senior food campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It can be maddening to see, year after year, most of the environmental and agricultural community continue to avoid doing what leading climate scientists agree we must do to significantly decrease emissions and pollution, and was viable yesterday: Create a more plant-based food system.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such a system in the US isn’t inevitable, or coming anytime soon, but it is possible. If it has any chance at taking off, buy-in from the broader US environmental community will need to precede it. For that to happen, its leaders will have to take their own advice: Follow the science wherever it leads, including to the inconvenient truth that changing how we farm alone won’t cut it. We have to rethink our relationship with meat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most ambitious goal of the animal movement has always been to eradicate factory farming and inspire people to eat more plants and fewer animals. This only makes sense, as the scale of the violence endemic to industrial farming radically dwarfs all other forms of animal suffering. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyond the problem of the inevitable suffering involved in&nbsp;the slaughter of&nbsp;animals we consume, factory farming&nbsp;necessitates&nbsp;new forms of animal abuse such as&nbsp;intensive confinement, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/8/23542789/big-meat-antibiotics-resistance-fda">drugs</a> that keep sick animals just alive enough to be profitable, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.farmforward.com/issues/genetic-modification/">genetic modifications</a>&nbsp;that induce diseases. (While genetic modification is often interpreted to mean direct edits to a genome, the USDA’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usda.gov/topics/biotechnology/biotechnology-glossary">definition</a>&nbsp;also includes selective breeding, the technique the factory farm industry has used to deform animals beyond recognition.)&nbsp;These harms to animals, as we will see, are tightly linked to harms to humans.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story is part of <strong>How Factory Farming Ends</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Read more from this special package analyzing the long fight against factory farming <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics">here</a>.</strong> This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the way forward for the animal movement may be less about swelling the ranks of vegetarians and vegans — which has long been its primary ambition — and more about identifying an overlapping consensus between social movements that center animals and those that center concerns like climate change and public health. These movements share an interest in shifting toward a more plant-based food system as never before. We should also share resources and tactics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, government at every level, from <a href="https://agriculture.ny.gov/news/new-york-state-announces-new-grant-opportunity-expand-meat-processing-industry">local</a> to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">federal</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">actively</a> promotes consuming high levels of animal products and the continued growth of factory farming; large portions of the legal system work primarily to defend industrial farms against ordinary citizens and public advocates rather than the other way around (for one powerful illustration of this, see the documentary <a href="https://www.smellofmoneydoc.com/"><em>The Smell of Money</em></a>). Only a broad coalition can hope to change this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Increased collaboration with the public health movement will be particularly crucial in encouraging a more plant-based food system. In the short term, though, it is emerging collaborations with the environmental movement that show the most promise. The well-known lower carbon footprint of plant-based diets — as low as a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-023-00795-w">quarter</a> of the emissions of meat-heavy diets — provides a particularly powerful form of common ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s consider a rather extraordinary development that resulted from animal and environmental groups working together that occurred in just the last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>A groundbreaking experiment</strong> suggests reducing US meat eating is attainable</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Starting last September, <a href="https://www.foodservicedirector.com/operations/sodexo-doubles-down-plant-based-offerings-college-campuses">hundreds</a> of American college and university dining halls serving about a million students began to systematically modify how they served food in ways designed to substantially increase the consumption of plants. The schools, which have in common the use of Sodexo as a food service provider but little else, were guided in part by a recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272494423002748?dgcid=author">peer-reviewed study</a> finding that the use of “plant-based defaults” could significantly shift diners’ choices toward plant-based foods. (One of us, Aaron, is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.betterfoodfoundation.org/who-we-are/meet-the-team/">on the board</a>&nbsp;of and helped launch an organization that partnered with&nbsp;Sodexo on this experiment, but he was not personally involved in the project.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the three-month study, a hot meal station in three college dining halls, two in the American Northeast and one in the South, alternated between serving a plant-based and meat-based meal by default. When a plant-based entrée was the default, diners could ask for a meat meal. Depending on how conservatively the results are calculated, on average&nbsp;between 21.4 and 57.2 percent fewer meat-based meals were chosen when plant-based foods were the default. And, crucially, surveys found that diners remained as satisfied as ever (something that the presence of <a href="https://www.betterfoodfoundation.org/reports-publications/serving-up-plants-by-default/">plant-based meats</a> seemed to have helped in this study). A range of other public and private <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-30/companies-and-schools-are-using-nudge-theory-to-cut-meat-consumption">institutions</a> — including governments, hospitals, and businesses — around the world are experimenting with similar tactics.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Diners do not need to be ethical superheroes, or even be ethically motivated, to eat in ways more in line with their values&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The basic insight being employed here is that institutional food service providers already make decisions every day that shape what their customers choose by deciding, for example, what dish to list first on the menu, what entree to make the special, and what products to most heavily promote. We diners are already being nudged by food service providers toward more profitable foods (often animal products) every time we buy food. The strategies being employed at the 400 colleges and universities in one way or another involve a decision on the part of dining services to let concerns about health and sustainability — especially climate change — influence these existing decisions about food order, placement, and so forth.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/Lehigh_Photo-Credit-Food-for-Climate-League.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,19.004306892188,100,61.991386215623" alt="photo of a dining hall food station where Tofu Tiki Masala and cilantro basmati rice are served and a nearby sign says chicken tiki masala can be requested by asking the service staff." title="photo of a dining hall food station where Tofu Tiki Masala and cilantro basmati rice are served and a nearby sign says chicken tiki masala can be requested by asking the service staff." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A plant-based default meal is served at Lehigh University. Students have the option of asking for a meat dish. | Food for Climate League" data-portal-copyright="Food for Climate League" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">This can be thought of as behavior architecture. Just as good physical architecture is aesthetically pleasing and makes it easy to do what we have come to that place to do, good behavior architecture in dining halls, supermarkets, and restaurants helps consumers make prosocial choices — like plant-based foods with lower climate impacts — the easiest choices. Diners do not need to be ethical superheroes, or even be ethically motivated, to eat in ways more in line with their values.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two issues raised here seem especially important. The first is to better understand how recent and unique the new overlapping consensus between animal and ecological concerns is and what is making it work. The second is to consider the potentially even more consequential, but less-developed, coalitional possibilities of animal and ecological advocates teaming up with the public health sector to advocate a shift towards plant-based diets and away from factory farming.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an era of ubiquitous factory farming, the public health sector has its own reasons to prefer a more plant-based food system —&nbsp;for example, the way that factory farms promote <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/what-should-health-professions-students-know-about-industrial-agriculture-and-disease/2023-04">antibiotic resistance</a>, an escalating global crisis associated with nearly 5 million annual deaths and increase the risk of <a href="https://animal.law.harvard.edu/news-article/animal-markets-and-zoonotic-disease/">zoonotic diseases</a> like bird flu reaching <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/22/21228158/coronavirus-pandemic-risk-factory-farming-meat">pandemic</a> proportions. Balanced plant-based diets are also widely regarded to have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10548756/#:~:text=An%20inverse%20association%20was%20observed,ranged%3A%2030.2%E2%80%9395.4%25).">health advantages</a> (especially lowering risk for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8604150/">heart disease</a>), but since these benefits are well known, here we want to emphasize the distinct advantages of a more plant-based food system, beyond the general healthfulness of plant foods.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That a more plant-based diet is better for animals isn’t enough to move policy. This same diet shift is already being used to reduce climate impacts; it could also preserve the value of antibiotics and reduce the number of new diseases we face, as well as shore up political will to transform our diets.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The climate science consensus on meat reduction</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The nascent alliance between animal and environmental advocates on food system change is not simple. The two movements have often had different agendas. For most of our lives, mainstream environmentalism has not seriously engaged the problems with the food system, especially the problems posed by industrial meat. This is true despite the fact scientists for decades have <a href="https://www.fao.org/4/a0701e/a0701e.pdf">documented</a> the enormous role meat plays in climate change and virtually every other environmental crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the reasons for this hesitancy are perfectly understandable: Emissions from the energy and transportation&nbsp;systems had proven&nbsp;technological solutions, which made solving emissions in those sectors comparatively straightforward. Food, by contrast, looked like a hornet’s nest. It’s hard enough to get people to focus on climate change, which until recently has felt so abstract, distant, and slow. To add into the conversation what is one of the most uncomfortable and contentious of all social issues — the ethics of eating — would likely have been an invitation to be ignored.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But sometimes being ignored is just another way to describe being ahead of one’s time. Addressing the role of food systems in climate change was perhaps ahead of its time 20 years ago when little progress had been made in energy and transport, but no more. Recent years have seen a new willingness and a recognition of the necessity to address the climate impacts of animal products. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The highly regarded <a href="https://eatforum.org/eat-lancet-commission/eat-lancet-commission-summary-report/">EAT-Lancet Commission</a>, a panel of nutrition, sustainability, and agriculture experts, in 2019 concluded that even if we decarbonized everything else, if we don’t address our food system, it will be impossible to meet the emissions target set by the Paris climate agreement. Global food system studies on the interventions needed to address climate change — such as the study led by University of Oxford researcher Joseph Poore published in <a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:b0b53649-5e93-4415-bf07-6b0b1227172f/files/m13e577c73b56987e9c3e8eeb47ca6e74"><em>Science</em></a> or the study published by the nonprofits <a href="https://grain.org/article/entries/5976-emissions-impossible-how-big-meat-and-dairy-are-heating-up-the-planet">GRAIN and the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy</a> — consistently note the necessity of reducing meat consumption.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Environmental policy advocates still often remain reluctant to push these conclusions in the nitty-gritty of policy work, but this seems to us the natural reluctance before one finally rips off the Band-Aid. While the study of the Sodexo schools suggests that the experience of eating fewer animals need not reduce diner satisfaction, the idea of eating fewer animals remains politically unpopular. Suggesting eating less of anything can be branded as un-American, and conservative news outlets have made a fetish of warning that environmentalists are “<a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/fox-news-corrects-false-claim-that-biden-is-coming-for-your-burgers">coming for your burgers</a>” even before any meaningful policies to shift diets have been enacted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It will take considerable movement effort to transform the consensus in environmental science about the need to shift diets fully into organizational practice and policy advocacy, but we believe the case for eating more plants is now so well established that there is no turning back. Advocates in the environmental space who press for meat reduction will still often find themselves resisted; a quiet civil war is <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/362224" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/e/362224">raging</a> in the movement. There have been and will be ups and downs in that war, but we believe an invisible threshold has been crossed and that, battle by battle, policy by policy, the environmental movement is integrating the scientific consensus that meat reduction is essential to addressing climate change and many other ecological concerns.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The crucial third leg in the coalition against factory </strong><b>farming</b> is public health</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, even when climate change advocates do address the problems with meat, there is the possibility of serious disagreements about the role of poultry and pork. Despite a high carbon footprint compared to plant-based foods and a load of other problems, poultry and pork meat can generally be <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-per-protein-poore">produced</a> at a fraction of the carbon footprint of beef. This is why we so often hear from environmentalists about the desirability of reducing beef and dairy consumption in particular: By the numbers, these industries have among the worst <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325532198_Reducing_food's_environmental_impacts_through_producers_and_consumers">climate footprint</a> of any food.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, in terms of animal suffering, no industry is as horrific as today’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/10/23589333/cecile-steele-chicken-meat-poultry-eggs-delaware">poultry industry</a>; the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">pork industry</a> is equally nightmarish, if smaller in scale (<a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates">virtually all</a> commercially available chickens and turkeys and the overwhelming majority of pig meat comes from factory farms). Modern industrial chickens have the disturbing distinction of being so genetically modified to produce more flesh and eggs that their very <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237556566_The_Challenge_of_Genetic_Change_in_the_Broiler_Chicken">biology</a> destines them to suffer from a range of diseases and incapacities (which is not to mention that it takes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22430749/beef-chicken-climate-diet-vegetarian">100 or more</a> individual chickens to produce as much meat as in a single cow). When climate activists suggest an overly numbers-driven approach to reducing food climate impacts, they may drive the production of more poultry and pig factory farms by recommending eating chicken or pork over beef. This is <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/global-banks-climate-friendly-meat/">already</a> <a href="https://heatmap.news/culture/the-complicated-case-for-pollotarianism">happening</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/QI6kK-chicken-s-rise-and-beef-s-decline-in-the-american-diet-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.672758743025,100,66.654482513949" alt="Chart showing US per capita meat consumption more than doubling over the last 50 years while beef consumption declines by a quarter." title="Chart showing US per capita meat consumption more than doubling over the last 50 years while beef consumption declines by a quarter." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Happily for the animal cause, though, data and research from the public health sector about the dangers of industrial poultry and pig production can ameliorate this tension. Studies show that while risks from different industries vary, if we don’t reduce animal-sourced foods, we will <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9629715/">increase infectious disease</a>. From the point of view of public health, the poultry industry is profoundly worrying, both because of the routine use of antibiotics that promotes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10141167/">antimicrobial resistance</a> and the potential to <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24145304/bird-flu-h5n1-avian-influenza-pandemic">seed a pandemic</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent months, the H5N1 bird flu virus, which if it mutates to be able to spread among humans could make Covid-19 seem like the common cold, has leaped <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/news/agency-announcements/federal-state-veterinary-public-health-agencies-share-update-hpai">from birds to cattle</a> and has infected <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/p-0703-4th-human-case-h5.html#:~:text=CDC%20Newsroom%20Home-,CDC%20Reports%20Fourth%20Human%20Case%20of%20H5,Tied%20to%20Dairy%20Cow%20Outbreak&amp;text=July%203%2C%202024%20%E2%80%93%20A%20human,in%20the%20state%20of%20Colorado.">several</a> US dairy workers. The extreme industrialization of both the poultry and pork industries — with their use of densely packed, genetically uniform, and immunocompromised animals — is a perfect Petri dish for cultivating the next plague.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just as climate activists have overlapping interests with animal advocates on diet change because of the high carbon footprint of animal products, public health advocates have overlapping interests because of the very basic biological fact that sick farmed animals not only suffer but can pose profound disease risk for human populations.&nbsp;The basic principle here is known in the international public health community as <a href="https://www.onehealthcommission.org/en/why_one_health/what_is_one_health/">One Health</a>, an approach that optimizes health outcomes by, in the words of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/one-health/about/index.html">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, “recognizing the interconnection between people, animals, plants, and their shared environment.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One Health is de rigueur in contemporary public health contexts. It is endorsed and promoted&nbsp;by the CDC, the <a href="https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/961101524657708673/one-health-operational-framework-for-strengthening-human-animal-and-environmental-public-health-systems-at-their-interface">World Bank</a>, and just about <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771424000211">every other</a> authoritative advocate of public health. Theoretically, One Health already guides US law and policy, yet it has very little influence when it runs up against powerful political interests. One Health advocates, like animal advocates, have to contend with the power of industry; so far, sociopolitical factors like entrenched commitments to factory farming (among others) <a href="https://www.intechopen.com/online-first/87546">thwart the implementation</a> of One Health frameworks. Ultimately, this means that factory farms benefit from unchecked <a href="https://www.fairr.org/resources/knowledge-hub/key-terms/costs-of-factory-farming">externalities</a> — the public rather than industry pays the immense cost of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6929930/">lost drugs</a> and the cost of managing or preventing <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8816336/">pandemics</a>. Of course, this at least temporarily makes reducing the consumption of animal products that much harder by making them artificially cheap.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The current crisis of antibiotic use in the US meat industry dramatically illustrates how public health advocates struggle to rein in big meat and could benefit from coalition with the animal movement. For many decades, the scientific community, often emphasizing a One Health frame, has warned about the <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/to-fight-antimicrobial-resistance-start-with-farm-animals/">loss of lifesaving drugs</a> because of the scale at which antibiotics are routinely administered to farmed animals. Despite high consumer demand for meat raised without antibiotics and government regulation of antibiotics in agriculture intensifying since the 2010s, the industry <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/8/23542789/big-meat-antibiotics-resistance-fda">can’t quit antibiotics</a>. In the factory farm system, sick animals are often more profitable than healthy ones, and sick animals need drugs to stay alive and to be profitable. This is why advocating for antibiotic-free meat without arguing for a change in production has ended up playing into the hands of industry. The problem has never been the drugs themselves, but the dismal conditions that necessitate them: The root problem is factory farming itself.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>What if public health concerns with the creation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens or the growth of new zoonotic diseases were taken up alongside concerns with cruelty and sustainability?&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, unsurprisingly, after a dip due to regulation starting in 2016, antibiotic use in agriculture, according to the latest <a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/cvm-updates/fda-releases-annual-summary-report-antimicrobials-sold-or-distributed-2022-use-food-producing">FDA statistics</a>, is ticking up again. But even this concerning growth in antibiotic sales understates the problem because a mounting body of evidence suggests that even meat labeled antibiotic-free is, illegally, often from animals that were fed drugs. A study published in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj1823"><em>Science</em></a> of the US supply of antibiotic-free beef found that fully <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/no-antibiotic-claims-on-beef-may-not-be-reliable-a3433700667/">15 percent</a> of the meat was from animals illegally fed drugs. New <a href="https://civileats.com/2024/06/12/medically-important-antibiotics-are-still-being-used-to-fatten-up-pigs/">evidence</a> also suggests pork producers are using prohibited antibiotics. Despite the USDA <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2023/06/14/usda-launches-effort-strengthen-substantiation-animal-raising">admitting</a> last year that antibiotic-free claims have indeed come into question, it has not yet taken corrective action.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The industry is not all-powerful, but it is often more powerful than any one social movement. Divided we are conquered.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what if public health advocates, who have long been frustrated with One Health being officially endorsed while being ignored in actual policy, worked in coordination with the nascent coalitions emerging between animal and climate groups? What if One Health concerns with the creation of antibiotic-resistant pathogens or the growth of new zoonotic diseases were taken up alongside concerns with cruelty and sustainability as a kind of third leg of the case for eating more plants and rolling back factory farming?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Something like this coalition seems the most promising direction in animal advocacy. We aren’t arguing anything novel; the power of coalitions is <a href="https://sites.ucmerced.edu/files/nvandyke/files/van_dyke_and_amos_-_social_movement_coalitions.pdf">well documented</a> in the social sciences, and most animal advocates are well aware of its value. But we are arguing that very recent developments, like the new willingness among environmentalists to take on the meat industry and the rise of One Health as the dominant paradigm for public health (despite failures to implement), are more important than generally understood.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The future will have to be collaborative</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pulling these thoughts together, here is the paradigm shift we see unfolding: The animal advocacy movement has long argued the ethical case for ending factory farming and moving toward plant-based diets; now is the time to highlight the pragmatic advantage of these diets and to double down on coalitional efforts. A food system less dependent on factory farming and more plant-based is not just a way to advocate for animals; it is, among other things, a partial solution to climate change and to growing public health risks associated with factory farms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We have emphasized coalition with environmentalists and One Health advocates in particular, but this is not meant to be exhaustive. As <a href="https://foodispower.org/environmental-and-global/environmental-racism/">environmental justice</a> activists know, the environmental and health harms we have noted fall disproportionately on <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/env.2021.0125">BIPOC</a> communities, making the factory farm a major driver of inequality and <a href="https://faunalytics.org/fundamentals-animal-and-social-justice/">social injustice</a>. This <a href="https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1544&amp;context=clr">racialization</a> of industrial farms has been especially well documented in <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23003487/north-carolina-hog-pork-bacon-farms-environmental-racism-black-residents-pollution-meat-industry">North Carolina’s</a> hog industry and points to the depth of other coalitional possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>The environmental movement has helped make an unimpeachable case against beef and dairy, but it is the less-developed alliance with the public health sector that will seal the case against chicken and pig factory farms</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, it does not do much good to advocate for such coalitions generically as we are doing here. That is all too easy. What can do a lot of good — and what already has started a promising trend toward more plant-based eating at colleges and universities — is the pragmatic work of forging real coalitions. Ultimately, the default veg dining strategy employed by the 400 Sodexo schools was adopted because it was pragmatic. Shifting diets in this way achieved the dramatic reduction in climate impact that Sodexo sought in connection with its <a href="https://us.sodexo.com/corporate-responsibility">sustainability pledges</a>, and it kept diners as happy with the food as ever, which was and is crucial to their bottom line.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even though plant-based defaults work, it is highly unlikely that Sodexo would have adopted them without the support it received from climate and animal activists. Even businesses like Sodexo, which made a climate pledge long before it started using plant-based defaults, often don’t appreciate the climate benefits of shifting diets or fear that it cannot be done without generating backlash.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is one reason why advocacy remains crucial. Sodexo considered and finally pursued plant-based defaults only in the course of a partnership with two nonprofit advocacy groups, one coming out of the climate movement, <a href="https://www.foodforclimateleague.org/">Food For Climate League</a>, and another — the organization we mentioned at the beginning of this essay that Aaron is connected to — out of the animal space, <a href="https://betterfoodfoundation.org/">Better Food Foundation</a>. A viable business case is not enough; it also needs champions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The environmental-animal movement coalition that helped support the Sodexo changes shows that coalitions can work but not that they are abundant. In our experience, though there is a lot of goodwill toward collaboration on shifting diets among many animal and environmental advocates on the ground, this is still rarely reflected in meaningful organizational partnerships or resource sharing across movements. This is an entrenched situation and, despite the encouragement we’re giving, will not be easy to change. The present animal movement is not collaborative.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Choosing a vegetarian or vegan diet is an ethical ideal that is profoundly meaningful for some — we highly recommend it if you are so inclined. Jonathan’s book <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/jonathan-safran-foer/eating-animals/9780316086646/?lens=little-brown"><em>Eating Animals</em></a><em> </em>details his own journey into the ethics of eating (and was made into a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaGukO4YUZQ&amp;ab_channel=InformationArchive">film</a>). But the animal advocacy movement’s success need not rest on the number of individuals who sign up for this admirable way of eating.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What by contrast is essential to movement goals is the need to collectively reduce the consumption of animal products from factory farms. The environmental movement has helped make an unimpeachable case against beef and dairy, but it is the less-developed alliance with the public health sector that will seal the case against chicken and pig factory farming. Happily, the diet-shifting efforts at colleges and universities in the past year suggest, perhaps in a more visible way than ever before, that this is imminently possible — if we work in coalition. There are still miles to go, but the road to that almost impossibly ambitious goal of shifting diets is getting clearer. The future is collaborative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/357900/supreme-court-loper-bright-raimondo-chevron-power-grab">partisan 6-3 ruling</a> issued this summer, the Supreme Court seized the opportunity to gut a cornerstone of federal regulation: <em>Chevron</em> deference, a legal doctrine that for the last 40 years has given government agencies the latitude to implement laws set by Congress. The ruling has given corporations a powerful tool with which to bend government toward their interests and away from those of ordinary Americans. It’s widely expected to imperil the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to limit climate-warming emissions and toxic pollutants, the Food and Drug Administration’s ability to ensure food and drug safety, and the Americans with Disabilities Act’s ability to protect disabled people from discrimination, among many other corners of the regulatory state.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This grave decision emerged from <a href="https://environment.yale.edu/news/article/wake-chevron-decision"><em>Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo</em></a>, a case brought by commercial fishing companies hoping to do away with federal rules requiring them to pay for government-mandated observers who ensure that they do not overfish. Notorious right-wing billionaire <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/16/climate/koch-chevron-deference-supreme-court.html">Charles Koch</a>, along with <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/these-industries-pitched-chevrons-demise-to-a-pro-business-supreme-court/">myriad corporate interests</a>, had lined up to support the fishermen’s case, sensing a chance to torch federal regulation of big business. Now, it won’t just be the fish who suffer as a result.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>This piece is part of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics">How Factory Farming Ends</a>, a collection of stories on the past and future of the long fight against factory farming, and how it might yet make real progress.</strong> This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ruling has been <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/183285/supreme-court-chevron-gorsuch-nitrous-oxide">widely</a> reported and <a href="https://slate.com/business/2024/07/chevron-deference-federal-agencies-expert-regulators-epa-osha-ftc-atf-fda.html">opined on</a> as a <a href="https://heatmap.news/climate/supreme-court-chevron">watershed</a> moment in American governance — yet few have remarked on the significance of the fishing industry’s role. That role is no coincidence, but rather is emblematic of an alarming, long-running trend: For decades, animal industries, including meat, dairy, and commercial fishing, have been working successfully to undermine democracy and government oversight in order to boost their bottom lines. The US government, meanwhile, at the behest of corporate influence, has spent the last three decades tarnishing animal activists fighting these industries as domestic terrorists, not because they pose a threat to people’s lives (no humans <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/ecoterrorism-fbi-animal-rights/">have ever</a> been killed as a result of animal activism) but because of the threat they pose to profits.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They’ve been able to do this, in part, because progressives have too often <a href="https://lux-magazine.com/article/our-animals-ourselves/">overlooked</a> the misdeeds of animal industries while buying into the image of animal activists as fringe and extreme — as people who would care more about herrings’ lives than fishermen’s livelihoods. This image, however, is taken straight from the animal industries’ playbook. For decades, corporate actors have worked covertly to divide the animal movement from other progressive causes in order to conquer it.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/CoeFishHooks.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,16.998174586532,100,66.003650826936" alt="Black-and-white drawing of various aquatic animals - fish, a duck, a sea lion, a turtle, a detached shark fin - injured by the fishing industry’s hooks, with red spots of blood." title="Black-and-white drawing of various aquatic animals - fish, a duck, a sea lion, a turtle, a detached shark fin - injured by the fishing industry’s hooks, with red spots of blood." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="“Fish Hooks and Victims” (2011) by Sue Coe | © 2011 Sue Coe/Courtesy Galerie St. Etienne, New York" data-portal-copyright="© 2011 Sue Coe/Courtesy Galerie St. Etienne, New York" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">In the late 1980s, for example, the American Medical Association (AMA) promoted a strategy to isolate and derail animal rights activists in order to halt their progress and growing popularity. As Sunaura Taylor, one of the authors of this piece, details in her book <a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/beasts-of-burden"><em>Beasts of Burden</em></a>, the AMA organized a movement of disabled and ill people to promote animal testing — a movement countered by a grassroots group of disabled and ill activists who objected to animal research. The AMA plan, which was never meant to be public, stated, “To defeat the animal rights movement, one has to peel away the outermost layers of support and isolate the hard-core activities from the general public and shrink the size of the sympathizers.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To build a successful progressive movement, one that can challenge animal industries’ extraordinary corporate malfeasance, the left needs to resist this strategy of divide-and-conquer. By treating concern for non-human animals as a fringe issue, progressives may actually be undermining many of the causes they care about, while also inadvertently emboldening the right and abetting the further erosion of democracy, including attacks on the regulatory state.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s often said in animal rights circles that the movement needs buy-in from the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/153302/animal-rights-next-frontier-left">broader left</a> to succeed. We agree, but we also believe the reverse is true: For progressive movements to win, they need to incorporate animal rights. Expanding our circle of concern beyond our species will help progressives<strong> </strong>address many of the urgent challenges of our day, from tackling climate change and protecting public health to reining in corporate power and preserving civil liberties, because animal issues are invariably connected to all of these causes. Given all that is at stake, the left<strong> </strong>must grow the circle of animal sympathizers before it’s too late.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Americans </strong>love animals. Why do our politics trash animal rights?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Americans are broadly united in their affection for animals. According to a 2022 <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/8/2/voters-demand-farm-animal-protections-from-both-politicians-and-companies">Data for Progress</a> survey, 80 percent of likely voters believe that preventing animal cruelty is a matter of personal moral concern, including 77 percent of Republicans. A third of Americans say they support animals having the same rights as people, a 2015 <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/183275/say-animals-rights-people.aspx">Gallup</a> poll found, a number that was up from 25 percent in 2008. Yet the systematic exploitation of animals in food production and scientific experimentation is rarely taken up in progressive politics.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>By treating concern for non-human animals as a fringe issue, progressives may actually be undermining many of the causes they care about</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take, for example, a groundbreaking recent case of corporate animal abuse. In 2022, the Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/animal-breeder-pleads-guilty-animal-welfare-and-pollution-crimes-and-will-pay-more-35m">secured</a> the rescue of over 4,000 beagles bred for medical research at a rural Virginia facility operated by the company Envigo. Investigators had uncovered that the dogs were being grossly neglected and mistreated, with animals crowded and sometimes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/20/beagles-rescued-envigo-medical-breeding-facility">crushed</a> to death in small cages, fed moldy food, and left to languish in their own waste. This past June, Envigo, a leading global supplier of animals used in research, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/animal-breeder-pleads-guilty-animal-welfare-and-pollution-crimes-and-will-pay-more-35m">pleaded guilty</a> to crimes including conspiracy to violate the Animal Welfare Act and fined $35 million — the largest fine ever imposed in an animal welfare case. They and their parent company Inotiv, which generated over $500 million in <a href="https://www.inotivco.com/news/inotiv-inc.-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-fiscal-2022-financial-results">revenue</a> in 2022, are now <a href="https://apnews.com/article/beagles-virginia-neglect-envigo-indiana-inotiv-49b77e5c3ac9a77dc06cde2498b1efc8#">barred</a> from breeding and selling dogs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The shocking story garnered headlines in the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/06/04/envigo-beagles-rescue-breeder-fine/">Washington Post</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/dec/20/beagles-rescued-envigo-medical-breeding-facility">Guardian</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/04/nx-s1-4991678/envigo-beagle-breeder-35-million-fine-animal-welfare">NPR</a>, and the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/12/us/envigo-beagles-breeder-adoption.html">New York Times</a>. But this landmark win for animal rights was met with a conspicuous indifference by progressive organizations, politicians, and news outlets, who ignored the groundbreaking victory, no matter that the story connects to key issues progressives care about, including corporate misconduct and ongoing attacks by animal industries on the public’s First Amendment right to protest.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This silence, however, shouldn’t come as a surprise. Animal advocates are, to use a phrase popularized by the Canadian philosopher <a href="https://www.willkymlicka.ca/">Will Kymlicka</a>, “orphans of the left”: Potential allies often do not see justice for non-human animals as a priority, or worse, mock or scorn it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Proponents of various social justice movements routinely express support for each other — feminist organisations often show support for Black Lives Matter, or for immigrant rights, or gay rights,” Kymlicka <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2019/04/human-supremacism-why-are-animal-rights-activists-still-the-orphans-of-the-left-2">writes</a>, “but animal rights groups remain outside this circle of progressive solidarity.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Instead of leveraging Americans’ concern for animals to unite against businesses and practices that harm both animals and people, progressive organizations tend to ignore these issues while ordinary leftists too often join the chorus of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18055532/vegans-vegetarian-research-uk">disdain and contempt</a> directed at activists and movements dedicated to reducing animal exploitation. As the <a href="https://citationsneeded.medium.com/episode-80-animal-rights-as-media-and-pop-culture-punchline-13a4e9f57692"><em>Citations Needed</em></a> podcast has shown, animal advocates are frequently treated as a “pop culture punchline,” while progressive media, with a few exceptions, rarely cover animal rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this, progressives are wholly united with the right. For conservative pundits and politicians, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/171781/meat-culture-war-crickets">vegetarian-bashing</a> is a cheap and easy way to offer proverbial red meat to their base. Over the past decade, the right’s hostility toward the LGBTQ+ movement and embrace of white nationalism have grown in parallel to a histrionic fetish for animal products and contempt for those who avoid them (“<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/soy-boy-insult-what-is-definition-far-right-men-masculinity-women-a8027816.html">soyboys</a>,” in the right’s parlance).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, the National Republican Senatorial Committee released a <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184129/republicans-nrsc-hysterical-talking-points-memo-kamala-harris">memo</a> of opposition research against Vice President Kamala Harris, the now-presumptive Democratic nominee, claiming she wants to ban red meat. Indignant culture warriors routinely warn that socialists are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/03/01/latest-right-wing-attack-democrats-they-want-take-away-your-hamburgers/">trying “to take away your hamburgers”</a> (along with the gas-guzzling grills they are cooked on) while foisting “lab-grown meat” on a resistant populace — no matter that such products aren’t even on store shelves and won’t be any time soon. In May, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/14/24069722/political-ban-cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-plant-based-labeling-laws">signed</a> a law criminalizing the manufacture and sale of cell-cultivated meats, declaring in a <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/05/01/governor-desantis-signs-legislation-to-keep-lab-grown-meat-out-of-florida/">statement</a> that by doing so he was “fighting back against the global elite.” Alabama followed suit, and other states have considered similar bans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These antics have produced very little pushback from Democrats. Instead, Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) jumped on the bandwagon, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/8/24151435/john-fetterman-lab-grown-cultivated-meat-ron-desantis-florida-ban">tweeting</a> his support for DeSantis’s approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We saw a similarly strange dynamic in 2019 after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) announced her groundbreaking proposal for a Green New Deal. Republicans went ballistic about the supposed threat to carnivory: “They want to take away your hamburgers,” <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-is-coming-for-your-hamburgers">fumed</a> former Trump adviser Sebastian Gorka. On an episode of the talk show <em>Desus &amp; Mero</em>, Ocasio-Cortez assured viewers that her plan did not involve “forc[ing] everybody to go vegan or anything crazy like that.” Rather than assuaging her opponents, her comments only affirmed the view that veganism is marginal and extreme.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ocasio-Cortez isn’t alone in thinking that being associated with an anti-meat, pro-animal ethos is a bridge too far. Abundant, cheap meat is unquestioned orthodoxy across the political spectrum; decades of government-subsidized animal agriculture and a culture that glorifies meat-eating have made animal rights a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">third rail in American politics</a>, helping to isolate the animal rights movement from the broader progressive ecosystem, even the left wing of the Democratic Party, and even when reining in factory farming would benefit the people that the Democratic coalition represents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In November, residents of Sonoma County, California, will vote on <a href="https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/">Measure J,</a> a first-of-its-kind ballot initiative to ban concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), or what are typically called factory farms. If passed, the measure would compel approximately two dozen livestock operations to close or downsize over three years, according to the Coalition to End Factory Farming, a group that formed to support the measure. While various public health organizations and even some Democratic politicians (most notably New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker) have <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/8/21311327/farmers-factory-farms-cafos-animal-rights-booker-warren-khanna">called</a> for the phase-out of CAFOs —&nbsp;which are notoriously harmful to animals, human workers, and the environment — the Sonoma County Democratic Party has come out <a href="https://sonomademocrats.org/sonoma-county-democratic-party-no-on-measure-j/">opposing</a> the measure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We could also look to the pork industry’s ongoing, nearly six-year campaign to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/03/supreme-court-proposition-12-pig-gestation-crates-california-animal-welfare-law">invalidate California&#8217;s Proposition 12</a>, a law that requires animals typically kept in tiny cages on factory farms to be given a modicum of space to move around. The pork industry’s case against Prop 12 before the Supreme Court last year threatened to overturn the will of an overwhelming majority of California voters, and to take down hundreds of progressive state and local regulations across the country along with it — but that did not stop the Biden administration from filing a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-468/228387/20220617195711500_No.%2021-468%20Natl%20Pork%20Producers%20v.%20Ross%20Final.pdf">brief</a> in support of the pork industry’s right to confine pregnant pigs in cages barely larger than their bodies. (Prop 12 ended up being upheld, but the industry’s effort to invalidate it through other means <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">continues</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unfortunately, the animal rights movement may be partly to blame for its relative isolation. Mainstream vegan advocacy tends to emphasize individual consumer choice, thereby turning what should be a liberation movement into little more than a lifestyle defined by a particular shopping list.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While we certainly encourage people to purchase oat- or nut-based alternatives instead of dairy or to purchase cosmetics produced without animal testing, we ultimately see veganism as part of a more far-reaching, socially transformative agenda. As we have <a href="https://lux-magazine.com/article/our-animals-ourselves/">written</a> elsewhere, we believe that animal rights activists need to connect their cause to larger issues of corporate exploitation and profit maximization — in other words, to the market forces that deepen socioeconomic disparities and that are now hurling humanity over an ecological cliff. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Progressives also need to be attuned to the ways speciesism, a belief in the superiority of human beings, reinforces other forms of human hierarchy, including racism, colonialism, ableism, and sexism.&nbsp;While the animal rights movement may have a long way to go in realizing these goals, the converse is also true: progressives must recognize that animal exploitation has serious implications for the broader movement that can no longer be ignored.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Big Meat has led the charge to undermine democracy and criminalize dissent</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The appalling impact of animal industries on the environment and human health are well known: methane emissions that drive a <a href="https://www.vox.com/22613532/climate-change-methane-emissions">warming climate</a>, <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/forests/issues/agribusiness/">deforestation</a>, <a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/devastating-water-footprint-animal-agriculture/163485/">water pollution</a>, <a href="https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/population_and_sustainability/food/">biodiversity loss</a>, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-drug-resistant-bacteria-travel-from-the-farm-to-your-table/">antibiotic resistance</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9629715/">zoonotic diseases</a> that could spark future pandemics, the <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/critical-issues-overfishing">catastrophic effects</a> on the ocean’s biological systems of overfishing; the list goes on. Those industries also lead to the horrific exploitation of workers, largely immigrants and people of color — and often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/18/magazine/child-labor-dangerous-jobs.html">children</a> — who are paid poverty wages and endure exceedingly high rates of injuries and psychological trauma while working in <a href="https://foodispower.org/human-labor-slavery/workers-in-the-fishing-industry/">commercial fishing</a>, factory farms, and meatpacking plants. Vox has reported on the devastating impact of the pork industry on <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23003487/north-carolina-hog-pork-bacon-farms-environmental-racism-black-residents-pollution-meat-industry">Black</a> communities in rural North Carolina, where people are outnumbered by pigs by as much as 35:1, and are sickened by enormous lagoons of swine feces and other environmental contaminants.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is less well known is that Big Meat is also busy undermining democracy. Globally, animal agriculture is a $2 trillion business, amply supported by government subsidies, and companies fiercely lobby around the world to protect their interests. Meat and dairy companies and industry trade groups have spent <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22379909/big-meat-companies-spend-millions-lobbying-climate">millions</a> of dollars in recent decades to derail climate action and <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/meat-industry-lobbyists-exposed/">block</a> animal welfare legislation. Their campaigns have spread disinformation while bankrolling politicians, and, as Vox recently detailed, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/357195/land-grant-universities-greenwashing-climate-methane-factory-farming">university scientists</a> who advance their agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Big Meat’s agenda increasingly focuses on suppressing First Amendment rights, whether by <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/14/24069722/political-ban-cell-cultivated-lab-grown-meat-plant-based-labeling-laws">pushing to make it illegal</a> for plant-based dairy alternatives to use the word “milk” in their marketing or to <a href="https://www.huschblackwell.com/newsandinsights/state-by-state-guide-to-ag-gag-legislation">criminalize</a> undercover investigations on factory farms under so-called ag-gag laws. The industry has close relationships with law enforcement and in recent years has <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23952627/wayne-hsiung-conviction-direct-action-everywhere-dxe-rescue-sonoma-county-chickens">helped deploy</a> disproportionate police force against animal rights activists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">US government repression of activism stretches back many decades, including the FBI’s now-notorious <a href="https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/news/fbi" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.lib.berkeley.edu/about/news/fbi">COINTELPRO</a> surveillance and sabotage of the Black power, peace, and feminist movements of the 1960s and 1970s. More recently, animal rights campaigns have been a “<a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/12/12/animal-people-documentary-shac-protest-terrorism/">canary in the coal mine</a>” for government repression of activism, having first been targeted with the nebulous charge of “domestic terrorism” in 1987, journalist Will Potter documents in his 2011 book <a href="http://www.greenisthenewred.com/blog/book/"><em>Green Is the New Red</em></a>. Yet, progressives have remained relatively silent about this record — perhaps because they saw animal rights as marginal and disconnected from other issues and did not anticipate how the attacks on animal rights activists’ civil liberties and protests would inevitably spread to other arenas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beginning in the 1990s, undercover investigations by activists exposed widespread abuse and neglect of dogs, cats, and primates used for animal experimentation, including at Huntingdon Life Sciences, then Europe’s largest animal testing laboratory, where now-infamous footage showed a lab worker punching beagle puppies in the face. Huntingdon Life Sciences <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/jan/21/martinbright.theobserver">tested</a> all manner of substances on animals, including household cleaners, dyes, flame retardants, pesticides, and cosmetics; it was one of the companies that, in 2015, merged to become Envigo — the corporation that, until recently, was breeding and abusing thousands of beagles in Virginia. Animal experimentation was, and remains, part of a multibillion-dollar international industry that involves a complex and expansive network of pharmaceutical companies, chemical manufacturers, government agencies, and factory-farm-style dog breeding mills like the one Envigo operated.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Only months after the twin towers fell, the FBI identified the animal rights movement as America’s No. 1 domestic terrorism threat&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) campaign gained momentum in the UK and the US at the turn of the millennium, tanking the company’s public reputation and share price, industry and government snapped into action. As Alleen Brown <a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/03/23/ecoterrorism-fbi-animal-rights/">explains</a> in the Intercept: “The fur and biomedical industries had spent years lobbying the Justice Department and lawmakers to go after eco-activists, who had damaged their property, held audacious demonstrations decrying their business activities, and cost them millions of dollars.” Industry groups seized on the attacks of September 11, 2001, to advance their longstanding agenda. Only months after the twin towers fell, the FBI <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-107hhrg77615/html/CHRG-107hhrg77615.htm" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-107hhrg77615/html/CHRG-107hhrg77615.htm">identified</a> the animal rights movement as America’s No. 1 domestic terrorism threat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2004, then-deputy assistant director of counterterrorism for the FBI, John E. Lewis, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-108shrg98179/html/CHRG-108shrg98179.htm" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-108shrg98179/html/CHRG-108shrg98179.htm">testified</a> before the Senate Judiciary Committee that there was a growing threat of animal rights extremists and that current terrorism laws were inadequate: They could not address the aboveground tactics used by groups including SHAC — namely, exposing industry wrongdoings and publicizing underground efforts (which included releasing animals from breeding facilities or laboratories, vandalism, setting off smoke and stink bombs, and more).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even as they argued for expanded powers, federal authorities were pursuing SHAC activists under existing laws. In 2006, a group of defendants, known as the “SHAC 7,” were <a href="https://www.greenisthenewred.com/blog/tag/shac-7/">convicted</a> under the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/102nd-congress/house-bill/2407/text">Animal Enterprise Protection Act</a>, a 1992 statute that criminalizes so-called “animal enterprise terrorism.” None were found to have been directly involved in any illegal acts, though they did participate in protests and share information online, including information prosecutors alleged was threatening to Huntingdon associates — evidence, according to the prosecution, of a criminal conspiracy. The activists were imprisoned, sentenced to up to six years, for free speech activities alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These activists were targeted because their activities and their convictions — which went beyond objecting to animal abuse to challenge the idea that nonhuman animals should be treated as commodities under any circumstances — threatened industry practices and profits. As Sen. James Inhofe (R-OK) <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-109shrg39521/html/CHRG-109shrg39521.htm">made clear</a> in 2005, authorities feared that animal liberation activists would “move to the timber industry or the defense industry or some other controversial industry.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To prevent this escalation, the Animal Enterprise Protection Act was amended to become the 2006 <a href="https://www.congress.gov/109/plaws/publ374/PLAW-109publ374.pdf">Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act</a>, which expanded government powers and defined a terrorist as someone who engages in interstate activity with the intent of causing damage to an animal enterprise, including economic damage such as the loss of profits — a definition <a href="http://www.greenisthenewred.com/blog/aeta-analysis-109th/">capacious enough</a> to cover many forms of peaceful protest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, law enforcement and legislators of both parties are applying these repressive tactics to a new generation of activists. In 2017, the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/fbi-targets-new-generation-black-activists">FBI’s counterterrorism</a> division named “Black identity extremists” as a growing threat, citing increased attention to police brutality and racial injustice. This overreach is now on stunning display in Georgia, where more than 40&nbsp;activists involved in the movement against “Cop City” — a $90 million police training facility that will raze a portion of Atlanta’s South River Forest — <a href="https://lux-magazine.com/article/cop-city/">are facing</a> domestic terrorism charges for alleged trespassing and property damage. They are the <a href="https://theappeal.org/stop-cop-city-protests-domestic-terrorism-georgia/">first</a> people to be prosecuted under a 2017 state statute that created more punitive consequences (up to 35 years in prison) for, in the words of the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-urges-georgia-lawmakers-to-reject-unnecessary-bill-expanding-georgias-already-overbroad-and-excessive-terrorism-laws">ACLU</a>, “property crimes that were already illegal, simply because of accompanying political expression critical of government policy.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Trump’s potential powers to criminalize protesters would be less acute if people hadn’t looked the other way when animal rights activists were first being targeted</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, numerous states have expanded, or attempted to expand, domestic terrorism statutes in similarly worrying ways. This year, for example, some New York Democrats <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/policy/2024/02/some-assembly-democrats-look-criminalize-disruptive-protests/394322/">responded</a> to pro-Palestine protests by proposing legislation that would turn blocking public streets or bridges into acts of domestic terrorism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Should Donald Trump take power next year, activists will likely face more hostility from government. The former president has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-antifa-trump.html">expressed support</a> for labeling antifa (short for anti-fascist) a terrorist organization — no matter that it is an ethos, not an actual group — as well as a desire <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/05/trump-revenge-second-term/">to use the Insurrection Act</a>, a 1807 law that would allow him to deploy the military to crush demonstrations he doesn’t like. Government’s potential powers to criminalize protesters would be less acute if people hadn’t looked the other way when animal rights activists were first being targeted decades ago. “The unprecedented repression of animal rights activists as ‘terrorists’ has become the post-9/11 model for criminalizing protest,” Will Potter told us. “This is the new corporate playbook. The most important lesson we can learn from it is that, unless we fight back, it will put everyone at risk.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Animal rights can help build a unified progressive movement</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The right correctly understands all progressive causes as connected; that’s why it is working to make compassion for animals part of its broader culture war, while also busily attacking organized labor, environmentalists, immigrants, gay and trans people, feminists, teachers of “critical race theory” and proponents of “DEI,” and students protesting for peace in Gaza. The left must respond in kind, by treating these issues as interconnected and in need of holistic solutions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s precedent for this approach. Animal advocacy has not always been cordoned off from other causes, and history offers numerous compelling examples for today’s activists. Indeed, one of the first American vegans we know of was Benjamin Lay, who authored one of the earliest American anti-slavery books, challenged both racial and gender hierarchies, and helped push the Quaker church toward abolition with his <a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/freedom/paradise-all">bold activism</a>. His compassion for animals was so intense that he not only refused to eat them, but also refused to travel by horse, walking everywhere by foot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Bill Wasik and Monica Murphy document in their new book<em> </em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/634494/our-kindred-creatures-by-bill-wasik-and-monica-murphy"><em>Our Kindred Creatures: How Americans Came to Feel the Way They Do About Animals</em></a>, the 19th-century movement for animal welfare was galvanized by the victory against slavery — many reformers of the day saw abolition, labor rights, democratic reform, women’s suffrage, and concern for animals as interlinked. The earliest American anti-vivisection campaigns, beginning in the late 1800s, were run by women who connected their own domination with the plight of animals undergoing experimentation. At the time, women exerted little control over their own bodies, and male doctors often prescribed invasive surgeries such as ovariectomies and hysterectomies for diagnoses including hysteria.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“For some Victorian women, images of the vivisected animal strapped to a table bore an uncanny and frightening resemblance to the gynecologically vivisected woman,” historian Diane Beers <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/For_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty.html?id=q2sHhHggZMoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;hl=en&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0#v=onepage&amp;q=hysteria&amp;f=false">writes</a>. “As women agitated for greater rights, this analogy of shared oppression linking themselves and animals provided a powerful motivation for their critique of the dark side of a decidedly patriarchal profession.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A similar cross-pollination of progressive causes happened again in the later part of the 20th century. The modern animal rights movement took shape at the crest of a wave of campaigns demanding rights for historically marginalized groups, which prompted some people to realize that non-human creatures are oppressed too; the term <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/speciesism/">speciesism</a> was <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/speciesism/">coined</a> in 1970. The SHAC campaign took inspiration from the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, which used boycotts and divestment to inflict economic costs on their opponents. SHAC activists successfully pressured dozens of suppliers, insurers, and lenders to cut ties with Huntingdon in order to make it impossible for the company to engage in business as usual. This financial savvy, inspired by earlier generations of organizers, is what made the campaign so effective, and so threatening.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite prolonged suppression and vilification, the animal rights movement has <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/open-rescue-movement/">endured</a>. Meanwhile, millions of ordinary people object to animal suffering — even if they continue to consume animal products and don’t yet see the suffering of a beloved pet as analogous to the suffering of an animal raised for research, let alone the pig, cow, chicken, or fish dead on their plate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With encouragement, they might begin to connect the dots — not just between the suffering of different animal species but also between the exploitation of animals and larger systems of oppression. Recall the recent bipartisan outrage over Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/30/kristi-noem-puppy-trump-vp-candidate?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;CMP=edit_2221&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1714483809">boasted</a> in her autobiography about shooting her difficult-to-train puppy Cricket. What if progressives had leveraged that moment of shock and horror to make the case that Noem’s disregard of a young dog’s life is not an aberration, but rather connected to the right wing’s disregard for life and embrace of violence in other arenas, including attacks on reproductive autonomy, immigrant rights, and democracy as we know it?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s notable, too, that Noem’s cold-blooded but isolated killing sparked far more public outcry than revelations of Envigo’s profit-driven disregard for animal life — or reports that vice presidential candidate and faux-populist Sen. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/jd-vance-funded-company-faces-animal-cruelty-allegations-1234617774/">J.D. Vance</a> (R-OH) has investments in a biotech startup that tests on live animals, leaving monkeys with burnt paws and genitals and, in at least one case, killed by faulty lab equipment. That news, like the Envigo story, offers an opportunity to connect the abuse of animals to the need to curtail corporate abuses more broadly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the high political stakes, including the threat of a second Trump term, the left needs to seize every opening to grow our movements. Instead of perpetuating the narrative that animal liberation activists are extremists who are not impacted by or attuned to other systemic harms, the time has come to recognize that far more Americans are actually animal advocates than we think. Doing so will strengthen struggles for environmental sustainability, racial and disability justice, restraining corporate power, and — perhaps most urgently — protecting our right to dissent. </p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">If you can stand to think about it long enough, the problem becomes paralyzing. <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-animals-get-slaughtered-every-day">Tens of billions</a> of land animals slaughtered every year; hundreds of millions every day; thousands in the time it takes to read this sentence. The number grows by billions more every year, into multiples that feel as abysmal as they are mind-numbing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On top of <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/animal-welfare">80 billion</a>, how can we comprehend another 5, 10, 20 billion more? How can it get worse? And while we can count suffering in the aggregate, these animals experience it as individuals, each one containing an infinite depth of conscious experience. Our human world is built atop a parallel universe of their misery, an inferno from which most of us prefer to look away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But one tiny minority group, so often tuned out by the public, has been imploring us to look. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than a year ago, my colleagues and I at Vox’s Future Perfect had the idea of launching a project that weighs the state of the movement against factory farming, a movement that has, for the last 50 years or so, fought valiantly to stanch the rise of an unprecedented system of organized violence against our fellow creatures.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This story is part of How Factory Farming Ends</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Read more from this special package analyzing the long fight against factory farming <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364288/how-factory-farming-ends-animal-rights-vegans-climate-ethics">here</a>. </strong>This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we found is that the fight sits at an uneasy inflection point: Animal rights activism and plant-based eating are more visible than ever; a handful of animal protection groups have managed to win major state and local animal welfare <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">laws</a> and extract concessions from <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22331708/eggs-cages-chickens-hens-meat-poultry">mega-corporations</a>. And yet, by any honest measure, the industrialized exploitation and abuse of animals is rapidly getting worse. Animal advocates are losing the fight.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meat consumption is <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/4/23818952/chicken-meat-forecast-predictions-beef-pork-oecd-fao">rising relentlessly</a> in the US and around the world. If you believe our most reputable pollsters, the <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/510038/identify-vegetarian-vegan.aspx">share</a> of Americans who call themselves vegetarian or vegan has largely remained static. Whatever gains animal advocates have achieved have not been enough to make a significant dent in the factory farm system or even limit its proliferation. All this is true despite the growing risks of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">climate change</a> and <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.add6681">pandemics</a>, both of which are fueled by the meat and dairy industries. Not even out of self-preservation has humanity yet shown a willingness to eat fewer animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These trends reflect a tragic irony of human development: As our numbers and material wealth <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/27/23893028/farmed-animals-animal-welfare-human-progress-poverty-climate-change-environment">have swelled, so has the population</a> of domesticated animals that we warehouse in merciless conditions and engineer to their biological limits. Animal advocates who attempt to change these conditions are up against centuries of entrenched cultural norms and identity, combined with ruthless <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22379909/big-meat-companies-spend-millions-lobbying-climate">agribusiness interests</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">captive political actors</a> that tell us today’s unprecedented levels of meat consumption are natural, necessary, and above all else, inevitable. But there is nothing natural about what we have built.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most honest accounts I’ve encountered of humanity’s relationship with nonhuman animals comes from political theorist Dinesh Wadiwel, who <a href="https://brill.com/display/title/32110?language=en">describes</a> it as a state of war — not a metaphorical war, but a literal one, in which we are the aggressors. If you were an alien who knew nothing about our species, you might expect a civilization that does what we do to other creatures to be filled with people who hate animals and like to make them suffer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet the vast majority of people care deeply about animals and hate to see them mistreated, so much so that the meat industry in the US and elsewhere <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/1/11/18176551/ag-gag-laws-factory-farms-explained">has pushed</a> to make it a crime to film conditions inside factory farms. Because we cannot be the morally righteous species we think we are while truly seeing what we have made.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This contradictory truth about our species may be our greatest refuge against despair. We do have profound capacities for compassion and moral courage, and so many of us already do know there’s something broken in our relationship with animals. As living standards rise around the world and American-style factory farming proliferates in regions that have long relied on largely plant-based diets, animal and vegan advocacy are on the rise, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everywhere in the world, across not just the Global North but also <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23344716/future-perfect-50-carolina-galvani-animal-welfare-activist-sinergia-animal">Latin America, Asia,</a> <a href="https://proveg.com/ng/">and</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/15/how-vegetarianism-is-going-back-to-its-roots-in-africa">Africa</a>, a growing movement of people is recognizing that our treatment of animals is a stain on the human conscience that must be wiped away. One of the greatest moral tests we’ll face over the next century will be whether we can heed these voices and decouple human prosperity from tyranny over animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Taking the green pill</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several years ago, New York Times journalist and Vox cofounder Ezra Klein coined “taking the green pill”: the experience of waking up to the mass torture of farm animals typically unremarked upon in polite society. And once you awaken, Klein said on a 2018 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=cXY584pT4zk">episode</a> of his podcast, all of a sudden “a world that seems completely normal becomes a horror show.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taking the green pill is depressing, socially alienating, and deeply countercultural; those who make the leap often struggle to get their loved ones to see the obvious, all while being told by society that they<em> </em>are actually the weird ones. I’ve been <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24131229/vegan-vegetarian-meatless-climate-solutions-recipes-connection">one of these</a> weird people since relatively early in life, and most of my time on Earth has been spent trying to understand why what was scorchingly clear to me remained unthinkable to everyone else. </p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why I wrote this</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Since I made the choice to leave meat <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24131229/vegan-vegetarian-meatless-climate-solutions-recipes-connection">behind for ethical reasons more than a decade ago</a>, the factory farm system has only gotten bigger and bigger. That’s one reason why I’ve spent the last several years reporting on meat’s impacts on animals, climate, politics, and culture. In this piece, I wanted to take a step back and think through the depth of the challenge facing the movement against animal exploitation.<br><br><strong>Have questions, comments, or ideas? </strong>Email me: <a href="mailto:marina@vox.com">marina@vox.com</a>.</p>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, over the last few decades, as animal welfare advocacy rapidly expanded and the crime of factory farming penetrated the public consciousness, many of these green-pilled people had cause to hope that we were on the cusp of an animal rights revolution. As a teenager in the late aughts, I became convinced factory farming wouldn’t survive another decade. I’d been educated to believe in the steady clip of social progress, and it was the dawn of Obama’s America, when radically new possibilities felt within reach. It seemed inconceivable that something both so wrong and so unnecessary, and so ultimately ruinous to humanity, could keep operating as the curtain was gradually pulled back.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I was far from the only one who thought this way. In college, a prominent animal rights figure told me about a theory that the movement’s ranks would soon grow exponentially, as every vegan in the world influenced a few of their loved ones to stop eating animals, and each one of those then influenced another few, and so on until we reached a critical mass large enough to transform society. If that sounds risible to you, consider how rapidly the world had changed in the half-century before. The very idea that tomorrow could look different from today came from recent experiences of social transformation in the US and around the globe, including decolonization, women’s liberation, gay rights, and the gradual if incomplete lifting of American racial apartheid.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not only has such a transformation for animals failed to materialize, but we may be even further away from it than we were 10 or 20 years ago. For all the awareness raised, US <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/per-capita-meat-usa">per capita meat consumption</a> <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/us/bed/per-capita-meat-consumption/4723/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.ibisworld.com/us/bed/per-capita-meat-consumption/4723/">sits</a> at record highs, suggesting that we haven’t managed to convince a meaningful share of the public to decrease their intake, let alone go vegetarian or vegan. Worse, Americans are now eating less red meat and a lot more chickens, the most <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21437054/chickens-factory-farming-animal-cruelty-welfare">abused</a> animals on the planet, who make up more than 90 percent of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">10 billion</a> animals slaughtered annually in the US. Because they weigh far less than cows or pigs, it takes many more individuals to produce an equivalent amount of meat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although we often use “factory farming” as a convenient shorthand for our systematic cruelty to animals, the true problem is much older, and runs far deeper than modern food production. People today often imagine that before industrialization, we used to raise animals the “right way,” conjuring images of Old MacDonald’s farm, where domesticated animals lived in harmony with humans and nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today’s meat industry profits from such powerful cultural associations, <a href="https://www.suecoe.com/artworks/categories/12/4843-sue-coe-fish-hooks-and-victims-2011/">slapping pictures</a> of happy animals onto their product labels and ad copy, but these have always been mythologies. Beyond the marketing is the reality that livestock animals have always been property, brought into the world without rights and for human purposes — bred to maximize productivity, mutilated and branded with hot irons, and slaughtered at the time of our choosing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Long before we had the ability to pack together thousands of animals in industrial sheds, humans wrestled with the horrors of animal exploitation and slaughter. Leo Tolstoy, in his 1891 <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Lyof_N._Tolsto%C3%AF/The_First_Step">essay</a> “The First Step” (“Pervaya Stupen”) advocating for a vegetarian diet, wrote about witnessing the killing of farm animals in czarist Russia. He describes a village pig dragged outside for slaughter, the animal’s “human-looking pink body” screaming in a “dreadful voice, resembling the shriek of a man.” After the screams subside and the animal is dead, even the gruff carriage driver accompanying Tolstoy lets out a heavy sigh. “Do people really not have to answer for such things?” he asks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would be unwise to judge our ancestors, who lived under far harsher conditions with <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-in-the-past">extraordinarily high</a> mortality rates even among humans, for their treatment of animals. More important is to understand that the human relationship with livestock has always been one of ownership and exploitation, which trumps their inherent needs and desires as living, autonomous creatures. Even on today’s so-called humane farms, animals often endure terrible physical and psychological suffering, as the Atlantic’s Annie Lowrey found in a sprawling <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/04/alexandre-farms-treatment-of-animals/677980/">investigation into one of the country’s most celebrated organic dairies</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is<em> </em>distinct about factory farming is how it’s deployed modern agricultural, biomedical, and financial technologies to push the exploitation of animals to astonishing new extremes. Much like technology has given humans the means to wage war against each other at a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area/356044/nuclear-annihilation-annie-jacobsen">terrifying scale</a>, it has also supercharged the human war on animals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Modern farmed animals’ bodies have been hyperoptimized for productivity without regard for welfare, so long as their productive capacity is unharmed. The livestock industry, with the aid of the US government, is continually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/dining/animal-welfare-at-risk-in-experiments-for-meat-industry.html">testing</a> how far animals can be pushed to yield more meat and more offspring. Chickens farmed for meat grow so large so fast that they live in chronic pain, and their legs often can’t support their weight; <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/do-better-cages-or-cage-free-environments-really-improve-the-lives-of-hens#:~:text=Hens%20are%20bred%20to%20be,around%20a%20dozen%20per%20year." data-type="link" data-id="https://ourworldindata.org/do-better-cages-or-cage-free-environments-really-improve-the-lives-of-hens#:~:text=Hens%20are%20bred%20to%20be,around%20a%20dozen%20per%20year.">egg-laying hens</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23588340/egg-prices-expensive-bird-flu-shortage-price-gouging">produce</a> 20 times more eggs than their wild-animal counterparts; dairy cows now make about <a href="https://clear.ucdavis.edu/explainers/how-dairy-milk-has-improved-its-environmental-and-climate-impact">three times</a> more milk than they did 60 years ago; mother pigs have been bred to give birth to <a href="https://origin.farmdocdaily.illinois.edu/2023/02/long-term-trends-in-pigs-per-litter-2.html">ever-more piglets</a> in each litter, resulting in frail, suffering runts. “It appears to be near-impossible in the industry to encounter a conceptual or ethical limit proposed for sows’ biological reproductive capacity,” Tufts anthropologist Alex Blanchette wrote in his 2020 book <em>Porkopolis</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And, of course, there are the numbers. Factory farming’s defining quality is sheer quantity, as my friend and philosopher John Sanbonmatsu put it. It’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/science/chicken-anthropocene-archaeology.html">reengineered the makeup</a> of life on Earth to such an extent that, Kyle Fish <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/27/23893028/farmed-animals-animal-welfare-human-progress-poverty-climate-change-environment">argued</a> in a post on the Effective Altruism forum last year, “the entire good of humanity may be outweighed by the cumulative suffering of farmed animals, with total animal suffering growing faster than human wellbeing is increasing.” It’s a provocative claim, but you don’t have to be a utilitarian to see the insight in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>It will be a long </strong>fight from here</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The solution is right in front of us — and need not even require any new technology — if we want it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today’s animal movement is vibrant, intrepid, and intellectually, politically, and racially diverse. More people than ever from varying backgrounds are working to dismantle animal exploitation — <a href="https://www.vox.com/23903831/justin-marceau-animal-law-direct-action-factory-farm-future-perfect-50-2023">lawyers</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23516639/veterinarians-avma-factory-farming-ventilation-shutdown">veterinarians</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/23934373/genesis-butler-animal-rights-climate-activist-future-perfect-50-2023">climate advocates</a>, <a href="https://www.ourhenhouse.org/ep751/">conservationists</a>, scientists, philosophers,&nbsp; <a href="https://www.pcrm.org/">physicians</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/miyokoschinner/?hl=en">chefs</a>, Hollywood stars, <a href="https://dotsiebauschusa.com/">athletes</a>, journalists, and old-fashioned, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23952627/wayne-hsiung-conviction-direct-action-everywhere-dxe-rescue-sonoma-county-chickens">troublemaking activists</a>. The cause is compelling enough to transcend the left-right binary, capacious enough to welcome everyone from leftists and progressives to <a href="https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/law_and_economics/568/">neoliberals</a> and <a href="https://www.deseret.com/2024/1/25/24000602/matthew-scully-dominion-fear-factories-factory-farming/">movement conservatives</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because animal rights has never been invited into the political mainstream, as other social causes eventually were, it maintains a lively spirit of experimentation, throwing creative ideas at the wall to see what sticks. One of the movement’s most exhilarating triumphs in recent memory took place in October 2022, when two activists with the group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), Wayne Hsiung and Paul Picklesimer, were <a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/10/08/smithfield-animal-rights-piglets-trial/">acquitted</a> of felony charges by a jury in a deep-red county of Utah for entering an enormous Smithfield Foods factory farm and rescuing two sick, suffering baby pigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The jury made the right choice,” Hsiung later <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/18/opinion/animal-rights-factory-farming.html">wrote</a> in the New York Times. “Our society eventually will, too.” Some jurors later <a href="https://www.law.du.edu/sites/default/files/2023-03/SCOL_ALP_Smithfield%20Trial%20Juror%20Interview%20Transcripts_March%202023.pdf">reported</a> being transformed by the experience. It was a stunning David and Goliath outcome, showing that even the most radical advocates of animal liberation, when given a chance to explain themselves, could win over unexpected audiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These moments are electrifying, yet getting them to enter public awareness, beyond a narrow sliver of animal rights obsessives, can feel like moving mountains. At the end of the day, the meat industry’s kill count continues to surge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s another way of looking at it: As my colleague Kenny Torrella points out, for a movement with a relatively tiny budget (by one account, <a href="https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/a-year-of-wins-for-farmed-animals">smaller</a> than that of the Metropolitan Museum of Art), farm animal advocates have achieved extraordinary things. They’ve managed to pass laws banning cruel factory farm practices in upward of a dozen states and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22331708/eggs-cages-chickens-hens-meat-poultry">convert</a> a sizable share of the egg market to cage-free, freeing millions of birds from the most extreme forms of confinement. They’ve trounced meat industry giants in courtrooms, from DxE’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23647682/factory-farming-dxe-criminal-trial-rescue">criminal acquittals</a> to the Supreme Court’s vindication of <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">Proposition 12</a> — despite the fierce opposition of the pork industry. A landmark California law, Proposition 12 bans pork produced with gestation crates, tiny cages that trap pigs in spaces barely larger than their bodies. Imagine how much more the movement could do if it had even one percent more resources, or had the buy-in of movements that should be natural allies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One parallel cause is especially important here: the climate movement, until recently politically marginal like animal rights, but now squarely within mainstream policymaking.&nbsp;Animal and climate advocacy, at least in theory, share an enormous amount of common ground: The <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">scientific consensus</a> calling for meat reduction to stay below warming targets is as unambiguous as the consensus on climate change itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet dietary change remains a political lightning rod, and US climate advocates tend to shy away from it. Building meaningful partnerships between the animal and environmental camps may be the clearest route to changing that, for the sake of both animals and our future on Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s danger for farmed animals here, too: Because beef is far worse for the climate than other meats, particularly poultry, a focus on reducing emissions from livestock could end up replacing cows with billions more chickens (for this reason, some have argued against climate-based animal advocacy altogether). The US has already been on that path for decades; some global leaders, unconvinced that dietary change is possible, <a href="https://sentientmedia.org/global-banks-climate-friendly-meat/">see</a> it as a pragmatic climate solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some climate experts are proving depressingly willing to sacrifice animals to shave off carbon emissions, <a href="https://sc-fss2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/FSS_Brief_Livestock_Sustainable_Food_Systems.pdf">calling</a> for the “sustainable intensification” of animal agriculture — a <a href="https://tabledebates.org/sites/default/files/2021-12/FCRN%20Building%20Block%20-%20What%20is%20sustainable%20intensification.pdf" data-type="link" data-id="https://tabledebates.org/sites/default/files/2021-12/FCRN%20Building%20Block%20-%20What%20is%20sustainable%20intensification.pdf">disputed</a> concept but one that can often mean, as my colleague Kenny Torrella <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/362224" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/e/362224">points out</a>, ramping up factory farmification and optimizing animals’ genes for productivity in an effort to get more meat for fewer emissions, much the same process that gave us today’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-66721642">Frankenchickens</a>. To prevent these outcomes, animal advocates will have to learn to work with and persuade those who don’t see the welfare of farmed animals as a priority. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the green-pilled, our society’s collective unwillingness to see that we could simply stop eating animals, or at least so many of them, and all be better off for it can be exasperating. Animal rights poses a fundamental challenge to foundational aspects of human civilization — not just what we eat but also things like our presumed right to breed, cage, and kill animals for scientific experiments. It challenges our very place on the planet. Peter Singer, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23737349/peter-singer-philosophy-animal-welfare-factory-farming-euthanasia-disabled-ethics">philosopher</a> whose work is sometimes credited with helping launch the modern animal rights movement, was absolutely right when he argued that there can be no rational justification for what we do to nonhuman animals; we’re not as special among species as we think we are. Only a tiny movement of iconoclasts has been willing to face up to this.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would be easy to descend into fatalism, a kind of anthro-pessimism, about the possibility of things getting better as long as humans dominate the planet. Certainly the numbers look that way. But this may stem, paradoxically, from an excess of <em>optimism</em>: We expect change to come fast. We may, instead, need to learn to see the animal liberation movement as part of a very early vanguard — akin to <a href="https://theconversation.com/mary-wollstonecraft-an-introduction-to-the-mother-of-first-wave-feminism-201046">Mary Wollstonecraft</a>, a forebear to modern feminism who was considered a radical thinker in the 18th century for arguing that women were capable of reason and full citizenship, or <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/opinion/sunday/youll-never-be-as-radical-as-this-18th-century-quaker-dwarf.html">Benjamin Lay</a>, the militant early 18th-century Quaker abolitionist (and animal rights advocate) who gave hell to his slave-owning co-religionists. Today’s animal activists, too, are laying the foundation for a future that people alive today may never see — a humbling realization but also, perhaps, an empowering one.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Progress is never guaranteed, but the future will always look different from the present, and we as a species have often surprised ourselves with our capacity to change our values, cultures, and economic systems. For example, although we might expect moral change to precede behavioral change, it may work the other way around. Our brains are, famously, self-justification machines, so if climate imperatives can eventually push us to eat less meat, that might start to shift values in favor of animal rights, as people no longer need to search for rationalizations for eating factory farmed animals. We might also yet see a breakthrough in food technology, like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23980010/cellular-agriculture-consortiums-collaboration-alternative-meat-lab-grown">slaughter-free meat</a>, that can smooth the path. Giving up, in any case, is not an option.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the billions upon billions of present and future animals who’ll be forced to suffer in a pointlessly cruel system of our making, that’s a cold comfort. For the rest of us, there is work to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">What if we told you that there is a simple way for humanity to slash climate-warming emissions, help prevent the next pandemic, and simultaneously eradicate&nbsp;one of the most significant moral atrocities of our time — one that nearly all of us bear some responsibility for?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We’re talking, of course, about factory farming. In 2024, it’s hardly a secret that the billions of animals raised for food are treated abysmally. They are, to name just a few standard industry practices, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353393/farm-bill-republicans-prop-12-gestation-crates-pork">caged</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/9/22967328/animal-cruelty-laws-state-federal-exemptions-pennsylvania-martin-farms-dairy-calves-dehorning">mutilated</a> without pain relief, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/10/23589333/cecile-steele-chicken-meat-poultry-eggs-delaware">intensively bred</a> to the point that they live in chronic pain and even struggle to stand up, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/8/21311327/farmers-factory-farms-cafos-animal-rights-booker-warren-khanna">before</a> being <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23647682/factory-farming-dxe-criminal-trial-rescue">slaughtered</a>, often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/04/opinion/meat-pork-animal-farm.html">painfully</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The sheer scale of this system defies comprehension. Every year, humans kill <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/billions-of-chickens-ducks-and-pigs-are-slaughtered-for-meat-every-year" data-type="link" data-id="https://ourworldindata.org/data-insights/billions-of-chickens-ducks-and-pigs-are-slaughtered-for-meat-every-year">80 billion</a> land animals — 10 times more than there are people on Earth — and an even <a href="https://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2/numbers-of-fish-caught-from-the-wild-each-year" data-type="link" data-id="https://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2/numbers-of-fish-caught-from-the-wild-each-year">larger</a>, poorly tracked number of fish.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the cost to animals wasn’t bad enough, industrial animal agriculture also spells peril for us: It fuels <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/8/23542789/big-meat-antibiotics-resistance-fda">antibiotic resistance</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362527/bird-flu-100-million-chickens-dead-risk-humans">zoonotic disease threats</a> that keep scientists up at night. It’s a massive <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/3/20/24105735/peak-meat-livestock-emissions-plant-based-climate-deadline">environmental liability</a>, emitting what researchers estimate is between 14 percent and 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and devouring more than <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/global-land-for-agriculture">one-third of the planet’s habitable land</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet factory farming is only expanding its reach around the globe, despite decades of animal advocacy striving to stop it, because it’s the most efficient way to produce lots of meat for a world of 8 billion people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We think there’s a better way. This week, Future Perfect is publishing <strong>How Factory Farming Ends, </strong>a package of stories on the past and future of the movement against factory farming; its struggle to change our culture, politics, and palates; and how it might yet make real progress.&nbsp;This series is supported by Animal Charity Evaluators, which received a grant from Builders Initiative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some stories delve into the animal rights movement’s fraught relationship with the climate and public health communities, and the prospects for building meaningful coalitions. Others scrutinize the animal rights movement from its 19th-century glory days, when vegetarianism was popular among utopian social reformers, to its present-day alienation from other progressive causes, to the messy, often maddening but essential legacy of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our hope is that these stories will challenge policy leaders and the broader public to imagine a kinder, saner, truly sustainable food system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, an attack on the al-Asad airbase in Iraq wounded <a href="https://www.airforcetimes.com/news/your-military/2024/08/06/5-us-troops-2-contractors-injured-in-rocket-attack-at-iraq-base/">at least five American military servicemembers and two contractors</a>. The attack could be an isolated incident, but there are signs that it may be part of a broader escalation in the region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The strike comes amid a period of escalating violence in the Middle East. <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel">Israel is still waging its war in Gaza</a>, and is believed to have also recently assassinated Hamas’s political leader, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/07/31/who-is-hamas-leader-ismail-haniyeh-killed/">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, and Hezbollah military commander <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanons-hezbollah-says-it-launched-drones-israel-retaliation-yet-come-2024-08-06/">Fuad Shukr</a> in Iran and Lebanon respectively. Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, has blamed Israel for the attacks, and is widely expected to retaliate. Now, uncertainty over how Iran will respond has raised the possibility of wider conflict in the region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s unclear if Iran had anything to do with the attack on al-Asad, and no group has claimed responsibility as of yet. There are Iran-allied groups operating in Iraq, such as the prominent Iraqi militia <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/who-is-kataib-hezbollah-group-blamed-killing-us-troops-2024-01-29/">Kataib Hezbollah</a>. But even if one of these groups is behind the strike, that doesn’t necessarily mean it was on Iran’s orders; Iran’s allies in Iraq sometimes act without explicit instruction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But whatever the calculus behind Monday’s attacks, they are a reminder of just how easily the Israel-Gaza conflict could escalate —&nbsp;and spiral out of control.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Israel and Iran have turned up the heat in recent weeks</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Iraq’s president, Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/7/24028613/iraq-coalition-iran-isis-united-states-israel-palestine-drone">announced in January</a> that he aimed to kick US troops out of his country, there are still roughly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-personnel-hurt-attack-against-base-iraq-officials-say-2024-08-05/">2,500 American troops</a> in Iraq, who are part of a mission to fight the Islamic State.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosions-iraqs-pmf-security-agency-base-south-baghdad-kill-one-member-sources-2024-07-30/">US forces recently targeted militias, known as Popular Mobilization Forces (PMFs</a>), that they accused of plotting to launch drones in a threat to US installations.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The PMFs are often referred to as Iran-backed —&nbsp;and they do have support from Iran, though the story is a bit more complicated than that. Though Iran funds and equips militia groups in Iraq, they are not as closely aligned with the Islamic Republic as Hezbollah in Lebanon, and have their own objectives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the PMFs are <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA700/RRA722-1/RAND_RRA722-1.pdf">technically part of the Iraqi military</a>. They were critical to the fight against ISIS, particularly early on in the conflict, as <a href="https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RRA700/RRA722-1/RAND_RRA722-1.pdf">a recent report from the RAND Corporation notes</a>. However, they do carry out attacks that further Iran’s foreign policy goals — to defeat Israel and get the Americans out of the Middle East. For example, these groups have been launching rocket attacks against US installations  since about 2020, after the US’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/03/asia/soleimani-profile-intl-hnk/index.html">assassination of Qasem Soleimani</a>, a revered leader in the Iranian military, <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/iranian-missiles-iraq">though some occurred as early as 2019</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So while Monday’s attack can be seen as a tit-for-tat response for the US attack last week, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosions-iraqs-pmf-security-agency-base-south-baghdad-kill-one-member-sources-2024-07-30/">killed four people</a>, it could also potentially be part of Iran’s response to the assassinations of Haniyeh and Shukr. That’s especially true given Haniyeh was killed inside Iran, a fact that has embarrassed the country and its security forces. And though Iran has blamed Israel for the attacks, the country’s leaders see the US as complicit as well, due to the strength of the American-Israeli alliance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether Iran can respond in a way that convinces Israel and the US to stand down rather than continue to escalate is the question, <a href="https://thesoufancenter.org/team/colin-p-clarke/">Colin Clarke</a>, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think that’s the challenge for the Iranians, is trying to thread that needle where they respond in a way that doesn’t prove to be completely impotent and reveal them as weak, but they also don’t want to go overboard.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Too strong a response could provoke further violence from Israel, and potentially the US, putting the world in danger of an even larger war. But judging Israel and the US’s ability to stomach an Iranian response is increasingly difficult, <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/ali-vaez">Ali Vaez</a>, director of the Iran program at the International Crisis Group, told Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think that’s where the risk primarily lies, because [Iran feels that] without inflicting pain, there is no gain deterrence-wise, and Israel is not a country that just absorbs pain and does not respond — even with US arm twisting,” Vaez said.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>So what happens next in the Middle East?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/11/4/23946143/israel-hamas-war-iran-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah">Fears of a region-wide war began</a> with Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israel, and have continued as regional powers have engaged in what’s known as “rocket diplomacy”; essentially, carefully calibrated attacks meant to send a message.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the case of the air base attack, Vaez said the message could be that “if [the US] fails to hold Israel back after Iran retaliates for Haniyeh’s killing in Tehran, that the US would also be caught in a crossfire this time around.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How Iran and its allies respond to the recent assassinations will help determine how big the conflict gets, and whether the equilibrium of violence in places like Lebanon — where Israel and Hezbollah have been trading rocket fire over Lebanon’s southern border, and where Israeli jets produced a sonic boom over Beirut — is broken.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Any Iranian response to the killings of Haniyeh and Shukr would probably rely on Iran’s regional partners overwhelming Israel’s Iron Dome defense system with rocket fire, so that at least some munitions get through and cause some real damage —&nbsp;perhaps even casualties.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Let’s say they end up killing large numbers of Israeli civilians in a missile or rocket attack, which is possible, if the Iron Dome is overwhelmed and malfunctions,” Clarke said. “If they escalate too much, the Israelis are really going to continue, especially Netanyahu, to pressure the United States to become more involved, which is not a good scenario for the Iranians.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And, according to Vaez, that’s a real possibility, with “a more sophisticated, multi-layered strategy from the Iranian side.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under that scenario, strikes and counterstrikes would likely continue — and the death toll would rise, in Iran, among its allied groups, and perhaps in Israel as well. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tim Walz was just over a year into his first term as Minnesota governor when a Minneapolis police officer murdered George Floyd in May 2020, touching off a generation-defining summer of global protests against police brutality and racial inequality.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four years later, Walz’s handling of the demonstrations — which included mass unrest in Minnesota’s largest cities — is under new scrutiny after Vice President Kamala Harris tapped the governor <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/365437/tim-walz-kamala-harris-vice-president-live-news-updates">to be her running mate</a> on Tuesday.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At least two people died during the violence in Minnesota’s Twin Cities, more than <a href="https://x.com/MnDPS_DPS/status/1267890735564668929">600 arrests</a> were made in the initial days of unrest, and the whole span of rioting and law enforcement response made it one of the most <a href="https://www.startribune.com/twin-cities-rebuilding-begins-with-donations-pressure-on-government/571075592">costly and destructive periods of civil unrest</a> in US history. Minneapolis and Saint Paul sustained hundreds of millions of dollars in damage during those riots, and hundreds of buildings were heavily damaged.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservatives have charged Walz with essentially <a href="https://x.com/TrumpWarRoom/status/1820810879484506388">allowing</a> rioters to “burn Minneapolis to the ground” and waffling on the deployment of National Guard troops to quell the violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz wasn’t the main authority in charge of responding to the unrest — that was the task of local officials, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey. But the task eventually passed to him once it was too much for local officials to handle. Both Walz and Frey’s governments have traded blame and presented their own versions of the events of those days of rage, but the full story of what happened is still not completely known.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What did Walz do during the unrest?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The main line of criticism of Walz’s response to the late-spring riots hinges on the time it took for him to deploy the Minnesota National Guard and coordinate with other state and local officials in restoring order.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Floyd was killed on May 25, and large protests, with some vandalism and police violence, began the next day. By the evening of May 27, largely peaceful protests grew more violent, with looting and arson around the city. Frey, the mayor, <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">reportedly contacted</a> Walz that evening and asked for help from the Minnesota National Guard. The city’s police chief then sent Walz’s office a <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">written request for 600 troops</a>, in addition to some other logistical notes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz and his office did not sign an executive order authorizing National Guard deployments <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-433799">until the following afternoon</a>, May 28, at which point much of the city had shut down, businesses were closed and boarded up to prevent looting, and buildings were smoldering after overnight arsons. That night saw some of the worst rioting, violence, and arson, as well as one of the indelible scenes of the protests: the breach and burning of the Minneapolis police’s <a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2020/06/30/the-precinct-is-on-fire-what-happened-at-minneapolis-3rd-precinct-and-what-it-means">Third Precinct police station</a>. A few hundred National Guard and Minnesota State Patrol officers had been deployed to Minneapolis by then, but <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/us/minneapolis-government-george-floyd.html">were charged</a> with protecting federal buildings and downtown areas of the city, as well as escorting first responders, instead of immediately going to hot spots.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Walz would later say that the city had not specified where the troops should go — and state and local officials later <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/31/us/minnesota-george-floyd-protests-state-police-review/index.html">reflected</a> that there was a breakdown in communication, coordination, and understanding of just how long it would take to get National Guard troops prepped.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The next morning, once National Guard troops and the state patrol had taken control of the area around the station, another lasting moment occurred: the arrest of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftLzQefpBvM">CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his crew</a> while reporting live near the police station.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At a press conference on May 29, Walz would take responsibility for the state patrol’s mishandling of the news crew, saying, “There is absolutely no reason something like this should happen. Calls were made immediately … I failed you last night in that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That press conference was also the first time Walz acknowledged that local officials’ response had been an “abject failure” and that he would now be leading the response. He said he had spoken with President Donald Trump and said that his tweets about <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/5/29/21274754/racist-history-trump-when-the-looting-starts-the-shooting-starts">“shooting” starting after looting</a> were “unhelpful.” He deployed more National Guard troops and instituted a curfew. Still, more violence and vandalism occurred.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The following day, Saturday, May 30, Walz would fully mobilize the National Guard, speak with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, and acknowledge that the situation had gotten worse because “outside agitators” had entered the region. The protests and riots wouldn’t be fully tamped down in the Twin Cities until June 7.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The aftermath was both a blame game, and a humbling process</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the protests, local and state officials sparred with each other over a lack of communication and a misunderstanding of the gravity of the situation. Frey, the mayor, would go on to say Walz had <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">hesitated</a> to step in and take leadership after Frey asked for help.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Through an extremely difficult situation, I told the truth,” Frey <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">told the Star Tribune</a> a few months later. “I relayed information as best I could to state partners. And we did what was demanded for the sake of our city.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">A Star Tribune investigation</a> found that Frey and his city government had been trying to give Walz and the state Department of Public Safety “what they said they needed to move forward” with deploying the National Guard to Minneapolis’s Third Precinct, where the unrest was concentrated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Star Tribune examined timestamped email and text logs and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/mayor-frey-gov-walz-hesitated-to-deploy-national-guard-during-minneapolis-riots/571999292">found plenty of correspondence that backed up the city officials’ sequence of events</a>: that they asked for help from the state government repeatedly, provided specifics, and did not get a prompt response. “He did not say yes,” Frey said of Walz. “He said he would consider it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The governor’s office, meanwhile, contested many of the mayor’s assertions. Contrary to the documents reviewed by the Star Tribune, Walz’s team argued Frey did not immediately provide an official request and had not specified where the focus of the National Guard should be. The governor’s office also contended Walz acted quickly once the request was received.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As a 24-year veteran of the Minnesota National Guard, Governor Walz knows how much planning goes into a successful mission,” a Walz spokesperson told the Star Tribune in 2020. “That’s why he pushed the City of Minneapolis for details and a strategy. He ordered the Minnesota National Guard to start preparing Thursday morning which allowed them to deploy to both St. Paul and Minneapolis that evening, per the Mayors’ requests.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By that point in the riots, state Republicans like then-state Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka had also criticized Walz’s response, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/30/politics/tim-walz-minnesota-george-floyd-killing/index.html">saying</a> it was “a failure of leadership” because “the governor didn’t take the right action.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Republicans are attacking the governor’s response now that he’s on the VP ticket</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the Walz announcement, Republicans have assailed him as “weak, failed, and dangerously liberal,” and zeroed in specifically on his response to the Floyd protests and their aftermath.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given that the racial reckoning that the Floyd murder kicked off included the rise to prominence of the “Defund the Police” slogan and movement, some conservatives have also claimed that Walz was being “soft on crime” for <a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-441356">supporting</a> police <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/minnesota-governor-signs-floyd-inspired-police-reform-bill/">reforms</a> in the state that banned chokeholds, created new mental health resources for police and first responders, and required excessive-force trainings. And others in right-wing media have <a href="https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1820825378547720226">conflated</a> his response to George Floyd’s murder specifically, which he connected to “<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?472637-1/minnesota-governor-walz-news-conference-protests-riots-police-violence">systemic issues</a>” with policing and “<a href="https://x.com/TPostMillennial/status/1820819691599757429">institutional racism</a>,” with Walz offering excuses for the violence.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the run-up to his selection as Harris’s potential VP, Walz hasn’t faced too many questions about his response to the 2020 unrest. But he may now face more scrutiny for that time. In response to questions from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/us/tim-walz-george-floyd-criticism.html">the New York Times</a> on Tuesday, a Walz spokesperson acknowledged that the riots were “a tragic time” but said that Walz “took action” to keep the city safe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Decisions were made in a situation that is what it is,” Walz said of the riots at a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1a_cmYLXrZw?si=acr05CZSR2njsAR5&amp;t=2001">press conference</a> earlier this month. “And I simply believe that we tried to do the best we can in each of those.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of neuroscience research, the mouse reigns supreme: <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/how-many-mice-and-rats-are-used-us-labs-controversial-study-says-more-100-million">in the US alone, tens of millions of mice</a> are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">studied</a> as a proxy for the human brain in labs. They’re small, they breed quickly, and they’re relatively easy to genetically manipulate, making mice ubiquitous in biomedical science. When studying something fundamental to biology, like how individual cells work, the leap from mouse to human doesn’t feel egregious. But when mice are used to study distinctly human conditions like autism, the parallels start to break down.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fifteen years ago, researchers <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/mouse-models-for-autism-debut/">introduced the first two mouse models of autism</a>, each carrying a genetic mutation linked to autism in humans. They claimed that these mice behaved like autistic humans, unusually preferring solitude over meeting new mice, and squeaking only around half as often as their non-autistic littermates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their results made major waves, inspiring researchers to experiment with other autism-related genes. Since the late 2000s, neuroscientists <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9189007/">have bred over 20 types of mouse models</a> with motor problems, sensory sensitivities, and repetitive behaviors. These each capture some hallmark of human autism — provided you buy that a mouse burying marbles is the same as, for example, an autistic child insisting on eating the same food every day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a freshly minted PhD working at the National Institute of Mental Health in the late 2000s, Jill Silverman <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/why-studying-autism-in-mice-may-be-doomed-to-fail/">ran experiments</a> on mice missing part of their <a href="https://gene.sfari.org/database/human-gene/SHANK3">SHANK3<em> </em>gene</a>, a mutation found in about 1 in 100 autistic people. These SHANK3 mice seemed to show “autistic-like behaviors” like social discomfort and compulsive grooming, similar to the repetitive body movements, or <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/what-you-need-to-know-about-stimming-and-autism">stimming</a>, seen in some humans with autism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silverman, now a principal investigator at the <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/mind-institute/">UC Davis Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MIND) Institute</a>, still gets compliments on these mice — even though many of her original findings couldn’t be reproduced in future experiments. “They’ll say all this amazing stuff praising it,” she said. “And I’m like, that is the biggest mistake this field has ever made.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Billions of dollars have been poured into autism research over the last decade, funding a staggering number of experiments — including over 1,500 studies in the US <a href="https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED647174.pdf">in 2020 alone</a>. Many of these studies use animal models, especially mice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether or not you believe that animal testing <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/14/23794186/animal-testing-experiments-vivisection-academic-fraud-dishonesty-research">is ethical (many don’t)</a>, scientists in numerous research fields — especially neuroscience, genetics, and other areas of biology — <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">run experiments on animals</a>. To understand how cells in the brain communicate to form thoughts and guide behavior, you need a living brain connected to a living body. Millions of rodents are used — and nearly all killed — for science experiments every year, many of which are preclinical tests of new drugs and other treatments with potential public health benefits, including for autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, all attempts to make drugs that help people manage some of the more challenging effects of autism, like sensory sensitivity or self-harm, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10062405/">have failed</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I asked senior scientist <a href="https://www.sfari.org/people/brigitta-gundersen/">Brigitta Gundersen</a>, who manages Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (<a href="https://www.sfari.org/">SFARI</a>) funding for autism studies <a href="https://www.sfari.org/resource/autism-rat-consortium/">involving rodents</a>, for an example of a tangible quality of life improvement that this line of research has given us, she paused. “I struggle to think of examples across all of psychiatry, frankly.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s this overall idea that understanding biology and understanding mechanisms will lead to better interventions,” she said. “But that hasn’t totally panned out.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In theory, figuring out how autism manifests in the brain and body should help scientists develop better treatments for some of its more debilitating symptoms, like seizures, mobility challenges, and self-harm. Given how much we still have to learn about how the brain works, autistic or otherwise, this kind of research is “a really long game,” Gundersen said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mouse models of autism-related gene mutations may help uncover the underlying biology of autism in the long run. But autistic people understandably want tangible support now, and research serving that need is hugely underfunded. “It barely matters to us what a mouse model says,” said Sam Crane, an advocate for people with disabilities and a public member of the federal <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/">Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee</a> (IACC), a group that helps policymakers decide what types of autism research to pay for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others, including the parents of autistic children with very high support needs, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/11/18/profound-autism-labels-neurodiversity/">fear that deprioritizing biological research will leave their loved ones behind</a>, turning attention away from developing potentially lifesaving treatments. Massive funding agencies like the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) are also wary of those trying to shift autism research away from genetics and neuroscience, arguing that <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/102368">scientific breakthroughs often come from long-term studies of fundamental biology</a> — even when those studies don’t seem to offer real-world benefits in the short term.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Looking at the numbers, though, research exploring how to help autistic people navigate everyday life — the research many autistic people <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/what-we-believe/">say they’d like to see</a> — is still only getting about a quarter of the money allocated for autism research in the US. At a moment when <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/03/23/autism-epidemic-cdc-numbers/">autism diagnoses are on the rise</a> — for reasons scientists still don’t fully understand — why are we spending so much on mice that might help humans eventually, and so little on services that could help humans now?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The history of autism research, briefly explained</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), <a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Autism-Spectrum-Disorder.pdf">as defined by</a> the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), is usually characterized by communication challenges, trouble navigating social interactions, and a high sensitivity to change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also defined by how different the roughly 5.4 million people diagnosed with autism in the US are from each other. The wide umbrella of ASD includes people who live independently, have fulfilling careers and relationships, and can advocate for their own needs. It also includes people who don’t speak much (or at all), use a wheelchair, and may require full-time support from a caregiver for the entirety of their lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biologically speaking, autism — like the brain in general — is still poorly understood. In the 1950s and 1960s, medical professionals embraced the <a href="https://www.autism-help.org/points-refrigerator-mothers.htm">now-discredited “refrigerator mother” theory</a> linking autism to cold, distant parenting, <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/mothers-and-autism-evolution-discourse-blame/2015-04">blaming mothers</a> for their children’s condition. Later, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/28/obituaries/28rimland.html">psychologist Bernie Rimland</a> presented evidence that autism is rooted in biology. Then, former physician Andrew Wakefield <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17057990/andrew-wakefield-vaccines-autism-study">published a paper</a> in 1998 incorrectly linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, fueling the modern <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22958419/covid-vaccine-mandate-pandemic-history">anti-vaccination movement</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, most researchers believe that autism is strongly influenced by genetics. However, when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/autism/signs-symptoms/index.html">symptoms can include everything</a> from difficulty reading social cues to seizures to constipation, it’s hard to figure out what genes might be causing what — after all, over several decades of work, scientists have compiled a <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/analysis-sequences-pegs-102-top-autism-genes/?fspec=1">list of 100 or so genes</a> that might be linked to autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To leaders at private funding agencies like SFARI, <a href="https://www.autismspeaks.org/?utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=IS-branded-conv&amp;utm_content=IS-evergreen&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwooq3BhB3EiwAYqYoEh4tmncVlXtGeW90hFwQGBeNbeY40R_1WxoBEujiGBrP1kGE4wm5ihoCKP4QAvD_BwE">Autism Speaks</a>, and the <a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/">Autism Science Foundation</a> (ASF), that complexity is precisely why we need basic research to explore the underlying biology and genetics of autism.<strong> </strong>The ultimate goal of these funders, several of whom have autistic children, is to find treatments for autism. Historically, some of these institutions <a href="https://the-art-of-autism.com/autism-speaks-revamps-its-mission-statement/">even wanted to find &#8220;cures.&#8221;</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But digging into the genetics of autism in the early aughts raised more questions than answers, forcing researchers to <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/dsm-5-redefines-autism/">reconsider what autism even is</a>. Meanwhile, in the absence of meaningful medical progress, some desperate parents turned to extreme DIY “cures” like <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/6/19/18684109/autism-vaccines-treatment-cure-bleach">making their autistic kids drink bleach</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Despite the fact that they’re pointing in diametrically opposed directions, there’s a common theme with the refrigerator mother approach and the anti-vaccine approach,” said <a href="https://healthpolicy.fas.harvard.edu/people/ari-neeman">Ari Ne’eman</a>, assistant professor at the Harvard School of Public Health and co-founder of the <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/">Autistic Self Advocacy Network</a> (ASAN). “Namely, they both really emphasize the idea of causation as central to the business of autism advocacy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Framing autism as a disease that “happens” to otherwise-healthy children as a consequence of their parenting, genetics, or environment makes it feel like something that science can fix, or even prevent in the first place. For many diseases — think deadly cancers — this wouldn’t be controversial.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But many autistic adults <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/8/31/9233295/autism-rights-kanner-asperger">believe the “causation” framing is hugely misguided</a>. Efforts to pinpoint genetic markers of autism have <a href="https://proto.life/2023/04/prenatal-screening-for-autism-is-an-ethical-dilemma/">raised serious concerns</a> about eugenics — namely, that if parents could get a prenatal test for autism, many of them would choose not to have those children.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prenatal tests for many diseases, like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease, <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/common-tests-during-pregnancy">already exist</a>, and the fears of autism advocates are not unfounded. In Iceland, for example, nearly 100 percent of parents who get prenatal tests for Down syndrome — a chromosomal condition affecting as many as <a href="https://www.globaldownsyndrome.org/about-down-syndrome/facts-about-down-syndrome/">6 million people</a> worldwide,<strong> </strong>many of whom live long, healthy, fulfilling lives — <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/iceland-eliminated-syndrome-abortion/">choose to abort their pregnancy</a> if the results are positive, causing the population of Down syndrome children to almost completely disappear there. Even in the US, where <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/370668/how-trump-could-ban-abortion-medication-president">abortion is politically fraught</a>, over <a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pd.2910/full%22">two-thirds of parents</a> choose not to give birth after finding out their child will have Down syndrome. Should it also be acceptable for parents to abort a pregnancy if they learn that their child will be autistic?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Autism research was really built with the assumption that the goal is a world without autism,” Ne’eman said. But a growing number of people embrace the neurodiversity movement, proposing that autism is simply <a href="https://www.amazon.com/NeuroTribes-Legacy-Autism-Future-Neurodiversity/dp/158333467X">another way to move through the world</a>. To them, the condition is not something to cure with medication or prevent with prenatal testing. This shift has led to significant controversy in the world of autism research. Autism Speaks <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/autism-speaks-but-should-everyone-listen">came under fire</a> in the mid-2010s for portraying autism as a devastating disease that ought to be stamped out, before <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/02/14/biggest-autism-advocacy-group-is-still-failing-too-many-autistic-people/">denouncing</a> that rhetoric in 2016.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For now, an effective prenatal test is not widely available — while autism does seem to be strongly influenced by genetics, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/the-problems-with-prenatal-testing-for-autism/">there isn’t a single gene that flags autism</a>. Prenatal tests and emerging <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/24105096/crispr-gene-editing-theory-dna-diversity">gene-editing</a> tools like CRISPR seem to work best for conditions caused by a single genetic mutation, like <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/sickle-cell-disease">sickle cell disease</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, scientists have listed about 100 genes that all seem related to someone’s likelihood of being diagnosed with autism, making a target for potential screenings, drugs, or other therapies much harder to pin down. Mutations in any one gene don’t necessarily mean that a person will be autistic, or shape what autism will look like for them. While some single-gene mutations cause specific neurodevelopmental disorders that fall under the umbrella of autism spectrum disorder, like <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/understanding-fragile-x-syndrome/">fragile X syndrome</a>, they are <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/autism-genetics-explained/">relatively rare</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All considered, autism isn’t currently something that can be addressed by traditional drug development pipelines. Yet, funding for projects studying the biology of autism <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">more than quadrupled</a> since 2008, while funding for projects finding better ways to help autistic people in day-to-day life <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/21/11464144/autism-funding-services-biology">fell or remained stagnant</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the <a href="https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/12/20061219-3.html">Combating Autism Act</a>, which George W. Bush signed into law in 2006, Congress established the <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/">Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee</a>. As the name suggests, the Combating Autism Act was focused on finding treatments to prevent or “cure” autism.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, the vast majority of IACC members were not autistic — and their funding priorities were oriented accordingly. Their <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2009/strategic_plan_2009.pdf">first set of recommendations</a>, published in 2009, <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2009/02/comments-at-february-4-2009-iacc-meeting/">heavily skewed</a> toward funding the search for causes and cures of autism. For example, they proposed spending $75 million on developing animal models of autism — nearly 50 times more than they suggested spending on studying everyday support services for autistic people.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can biologists breed autistic mice? (Not really.)</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the world of biomedical research, where there are genetic risk factors, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK231336/">there are genetically altered mouse models</a>. But by continuing to fall back on the rodents that they are so accustomed to studying, researchers are holding themselves back from fully understanding how autism manifests in humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mice are small, reproduce quickly, and share about <a href="https://www.genome.gov/10001345/importance-of-mouse-genome">85 percent of their functional genes</a> with humans, making them desirable to geneticists hoping to study diseases outside of the human body. While non-animal models are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/370457/animal-testing-science-medicine-vaccines-cruelty-free">slowly replacing animal testing</a> in many areas of science, “you need a live animal to study a disorder that’s solely behavioral,” Silverman said. “Cells don’t behave.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mice behave, but their behavior is very different from ours. So, neuroscientists have had to stretch <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/why-studying-autism-in-mice-may-be-doomed-to-fail/">to draw parallels</a> between the behavior of mice and autistic humans. If a mouse buries marbles with unusual fervor or over-grooms themselves, a study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108161/">may qualify it as</a> “repetitive behavior.” If a mouse prefers being alone to hanging out with a stranger mouse in its cage, it’s displaying “social deficits.” Studies have even measured changes in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763420304383">ultrasonic vocalizations in mice</a> to try to understand speech problems in autistic humans, and recorded electrical activity from the brains of <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/advs.202402493">dogs with autism-related gene mutations</a> to see whether LSD could improve their social interactions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal behavior is finicky, though — especially when those animals are <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23795087/animal-experiments-primates-mental-health-effective">living in tiny laboratory cages</a>, far from their natural habitat. The same mouse in the same marble-burying setup, for example, may bury fewer marbles than usual one day because it got distracted by the smell of whatever shampoo the experimenter used that morning.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Human error can play a role, too. An exhausted grad student may miscount the number of times two mice bump noses. Researchers in different labs may not even agree what that nose-bumping behavior means, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/how-artificial-intelligence-is-shaking-up-animal-behavior-studies-in-autism/">or how to classify</a> it in their papers. It “just lends itself to a lack of reproducibility,” Gundersen said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also makes preclinical trials for new treatments, which are often conducted in animals, challenging to translate to humans. Many symptoms, especially those related to social interactions and communication, are distinctly human — so much so that they’re nearly impossible to reproduce in mice. “You know,” Gundersen said, “no mice talk.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, more scientists are rejecting the idea that mice can actually exhibit autistic-like behaviors. “Nobody thinks that mice are people,” Gundersen told me. “Nobody thinks that mice are modeling autism.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the number of publications featuring “mouse model(s) of autism” in the title <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTQa9l1rWjZRVtuBzBywJUiajxZ-aqDCcq834jrr3YpRgK92L5I3MR0taYvJhpOX0w9OWFgD9YTmErU/pubchart?oid=1977171245&amp;format=image">has steadily increased</a> since they were first introduced in the mid-2000s. A cynic might wonder why scientists are continuing to pursue this line of research, when both autistic self-advocates and a growing number of leaders in biomedicine are saying that it doesn’t make any sense.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ne’eman said that some people in the autistic community jokingly refer to autism research as a “geneticist’s <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbernick/2020/08/25/the-rebuilding-and-the-autism-full-employment-act-of-2021/">Full Employment Act</a>” — a parallel to the proposed <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/agenda/2021/10/04/americans-autism-employment-support-514667">Autism Full Employment Act</a>, which would create incentives for workplaces to hire autistic people.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The grant application system is really competitive. To boost their chances of getting research funding, applicants increasingly have to <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691616687745">twist their research proposals</a> to align with whoever will give them money. A lab interested in studying how gene expression guides brain cells to form connections with each other, for example, could pitch it as an autism study to open up additional funding opportunities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, Ne’eman suspects that some scientists are “looking at the autism research agenda as exclusively or primarily a vehicle for a relatively small number of abstract questions of basic science,” which aims to expand knowledge without necessarily translating to new drugs or other practical applications. Just look at the mice: it’s been clear for years that they’re a bad proxy for autistic people, but many biomedical researchers have built their careers around using them. Moving away from dysfunctional models requires time, money, and critically evaluating old, imperfect findings — something scientists aren’t really incentivized to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People like <a href="https://autismsciencefoundation.org/teams/dr-alycia-halladay/">Alycia Halladay</a>, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation, worry that self-advocates like Ne’eman are too dismissive of basic science. But it isn’t that autistic people don’t value science. Rather, many of them think the somewhat futile search for a “cure” to autism shouldn’t receive as much funding as it does, relative to other areas of research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A more promising path for biomedical researchers could be studying rare neurodevelopmental disorders, like <a href="https://www.angelman.org/">Angelman syndrome</a> and <a href="https://www.rettsyndrome.org/about-rett-syndrome/what-is-rett-syndrome/">Rett syndrome</a>, caused by mutations in a single gene that exists in both mice and humans. People with disorders like these often have symptoms experienced by others with autism, like <a href="https://autism.org/autism-and-seizures/">seizures</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/autism-spectrum-disorder/expert-answers/autism-and-digestive-symptoms/faq-20322778">gastrointestinal issues</a>, and <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/sleep-problems-autism-explained/">insomnia</a> — which are more easily quantifiable in mice than, say, language.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Silverman moved her lab in this direction entirely, after <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/gbb.12803">losing faith in models</a> of other “autism-like behaviors.” She hopes that a clearer understanding of these specific genetic mutations will lay the foundation for things like better epilepsy medications down the line — not only for those with Angelman syndrome, but for anyone who experiences seizures alongside autism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I asked Halladay what research she wanted to see, as the <a href="https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/meet-alycia-halladay/">mother of an autistic daughter</a>. She agreed that more investigations of conditions related to autism, like sensory sensitivity, would be incredibly helpful to families like her own. Halladay, like many other parents, doesn’t want her daughter’s autism to go away; she just <a href="https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/meet-alycia-halladay/">wants more support</a> — and possibly medicine — to help her child live the best life possible.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Autism research is torn between different visions</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In general, Ne’eman thinks that “the average autistic person, as well as the average family member, doesn’t wake up in the morning thinking, ‘Have they found a better mouse model?’” They do think about whether they’ll be able to find a full-time caretaker who is covered by insurance, or what the newest adaptive communication devices will be capable of.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When autistic self-advocates were largely excluded from the decision-making process, funding for things that would help them immediately, like communication assistance or housing support, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8035332/">fell by the wayside</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s since changed — today, the IACC includes 23 non-autistic government employees and 22 public members, <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/federal-autism-committee-names-new-members/">seven of whom are autistic</a> themselves. Their budget priorities <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">have shifted accordingly</a>, centering research questions like “What services and supports are needed to maximize health and well-being?” in addition to basic biology studies.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, the gap between the committee’s proposed budget and how much funders actually spend <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/portfolio-analysis/2020/portfolio_analysis_2020.pdf?ver=5">has also grown</a>. And while funding for services and support doubled between 2019 and 2020, it still only accounted for 8.4 percent of the money spent that year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One big thing standing in the way of the IACC’s recommendations and reality: the biggest sources of science funding, public and private, weren’t really built to fund things other than biology research. Of the 28 organizations listed as funding autism-related projects between 2019 and 2020, the National Institutes of Health and SFARI — which only award grants for basic science and clinical research — <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/portfolio-analysis/2020/portfolio_analysis_2020.pdf?ver=5">together paid for over 80 percent of research</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Agencies like the <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncser/research/">Department of Education</a> and the <a href="https://acl.gov/">Administration for Community Living</a> pay for projects studying interventions like how to help autistic adults avoid institutionalization and live as independently as possible — <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/about-asan/what-we-believe/">major priorities for autistic self-advocates</a>. However, they only fund a tiny portion of autism research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Solving this problem will likely require a major redistribution of funding, or a big overall increase in the pool of money available to everyone. “I’m not sure that you can totally fix it by just yelling at the NIH,” Crane said. In fact, she suspects that the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/organization/od/office-of-national-autism-coordination-onac">Office of National Autism Coordination</a>,<strong> </strong>housed within the NIH, knows that they’re supposed to be funding more studies about how to support autistic people — they’re just not receiving grant applications for them. The NIH did not respond to Vox’s requests for comment by the time of publication.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One solution the IACC recommended involves <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/publications/strategic-plan/2023/strategic_plan_2023.pdf?ver=8">growing the overall pool of money</a> set aside for autism research to $685 million by next year. They specifically highlighted three research areas that need the most additional resources: lifespan issues, evidence-based interventions and services, and the development of culturally responsive services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By “lifespan issues,” the IACC means anything related to big life transitions: access to higher education and employment, opportunities to live as independently as possible alongside non-autistic community members, and health care. Figuring out how to help autistic adults — including those with the most severe disabilities — <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2012/08/career-options/">find fulfilling jobs</a> that they’re good at, <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2024/05/beyond-coercion-and-institutionalization/">stay out</a> of harmful psychiatric institutions, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/11/1098150733/dating-coaches-who-specialize-in-working-with-people-with-autism-are-in-demand">form healthy relationships</a> doesn’t require mouse models. It requires piloting initiatives like new <a href="https://iacc.hhs.gov/resources/housing/websites/">housing programs</a>, building better <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/2017/10/everybody-communicates-our-new-toolkit-on-communication-supports/">assistive communication devices</a>, and other community-oriented research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Studying existing interventions to make sure they’re helping autistic people — not just making them appear non-autistic in public — is also crucial, Crane said. For example, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sweetpoochers/video/7405244574127361311?lang=en">applied behavioral analysis (ABA) therapy</a>, which rewards “goal behaviors” like making eye contact or saying hello to people, is <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joannareese7/video/7356684281642634539?lang=en">controversial in the autistic community</a> because it can be experienced as <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@burritos_and_adhd/video/7039802682588040453?lang=en">abusive and coercive</a>. Most existing studies on the effectiveness of ABA measured things like whether recipients <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/when-disability-defined-behavior-outcome-measures-should-not-promote-passing/2021-07">behaved better in the classroom</a>, rather than long-term outcomes like overall academic achievement or quality of life. With more money, Crane hopes this can change. “We need to be funding research that actually tracks the outcomes that matter to people.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bottom line is that we don’t need more mouse models of autism or of autism-like behaviors. Biomedical science has a role to play, especially in helping people manage symptoms of other autism-related health issues like epilepsy and sleep disorders — but it has claimed a disproportionately large chunk of autism research funding for too long.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some people, especially the parents of children with intellectual and physical disabilities related to autism, argue that autistic self-advocates who push back against the biomedical research agenda are acting out of self-interest, leaving those with the most severe disabilities behind. People with different experiences of autism, Autism Science Foundation president Alison Singer <a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/spectrum/its-time-to-embrace-profound-autism/">argues</a>, need different things. Specifically, she believes that people with the most severe disabilities need the kinds of pharmaceutical interventions that biomedical research aims to find — and that many autistic self-advocates want to deprioritize.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ne’eman believes the opposite is true. “Those with the most severe impairments are especially poorly served by research that does not relate back to their needs,” he said. In its <a href="https://autisticadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/genetic-statement-concerns.pdf">statement on genetic research</a>, the Autistic Self-Advocacy Network emphasizes, “Autistic people with the highest support needs are some of the most vulnerable members of our community. They deserve good lives with the right to make their own decisions, not yet another round of ‘cures’ that will not work.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neuroscience still has a lot to offer the autism community, but neuroscientists need to listen to the people they’re claiming to serve. Ditching outdated behavioral tests on mouse models of “autism-like behavior” might be a great place to start.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hi, I’m Paige Vega, Vox’s climate editor. Over the past few months, I’ve been working with Joseph Lee, a New York City-based journalist and member of the Aquinnah Wampanoag Tribe, on a series exploring Indigenous solutions that address extreme weather and climate change. And today, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we’ve published the project’s latest feature, a story that takes us to Idaho, where the Coeur d’Alene Tribe is undergoing a sweeping, multi-decade effort to restore an important wetland on the reservation. Their restoration, guided by the return of ancestral food sources, could serve as a model for the rest of the country. <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/377249/climate-solutions-traditional-indigenous-foods-water-potato">You can read it here</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stories like the Coeur d’Alene’s highlight the value of Indigenous solutions as we face increasingly extreme weather and natural disasters and navigate the brutal effects of the climate crisis.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around the world, Indigenous people have the smallest carbon footprint, <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/climate-change.html">according to the United Nations</a>, but are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change because they disproportionately live in geographically high-risk areas. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, these communities are also key sources of knowledge and understanding on climate change impacts, responses, and adaptation. Their traditional knowledge — focused on sustainability and resilience, from forecasting weather patterns to improving agricultural practices and management of natural resources — has increasingly gained recognition at the international level as a vital way to tackle climate change.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I talked with Lee about the process of exploring several tribes’ climate dilemmas, and why the alternative posture they’re taking can offer us uniquely humble, approachable, and nature-first holistic approaches — something we could all take to heart. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Paige Vega:</strong> <strong>Let’s talk about the project </strong><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372001/changing-with-our-climate"><strong>Changing With Our Climate</strong></a><strong> and how it came to be. What were some of the goals you had — things you really wanted to hit home through these stories?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Joseph Lee: </strong>We wanted to look at different ways Indigenous people are adapting to climate change and extreme weather. For years, I’ve been hearing a lot about how Indigenous people <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2019/07/on-the-frontlines-of-climate-change/#:~:text=Indigenous%20communities%20are%20key%20sources,who%20oppose%20new%20energy%20projects.">are on the front lines of climate change</a> and that Indigenous knowledge and land stewardship are good for the environment, so we wanted to explore in depth what that actually looks like in different Indigenous communities. In each story, we really wanted to focus on a specific community, to show the diversity of Indian Country, the challenges tribes are facing, but also the range of creative solutions they’re working on. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>How do you draw on your own perspective and life experiences as well as your professional experiences reporting on Indigenous communities?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Writing this series gave me a lot of opportunities to think about my own tribe, the <a href="https://wampanoagtribe-nsn.gov/">Aquinnah Wampanoag</a>. For example, in writing about the Coeur d’Alene Tribe’s water potato harvest, in our story that <a href="https://www.vox.com/e/377249">published on Vox today</a>, I was reminded of my tribe’s annual cranberry harvest, which I just attended. Or <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372014/shinnecock-nation-tribe-sea-rise-hamptons">when I visited the Shinnecock Nation in August</a>, I couldn’t help but see the similarities between their tension with their wealthy Hamptons neighbors and my tribe’s experience on Martha’s Vineyard. I think my personal experience can help me think about what questions to ask, but my background doesn’t give me any sort of secret code to understanding other tribes. Every tribe is different, and my goal for this series was to show the specific situations facing each featured community. </p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What is the value of traditional ecological knowledge and Indigenous solutions? What can all communities learn from the distinct way that tribes grapple with extreme weather and climate change?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indigenous traditional ecological knowledge is based on generations of experience with land and environment. The Coeur d’Alene Tribe, for example, relied on a beloved elder’s memory when they began reconnecting old stream channels in their wetlands restoration project. And in our first piece [about <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/358597/climate-extreme-heat-alaska-indigenous-solutions">how an Alaskan tribe dependent on sea ice is adapting to rapid warming</a>], Roberta Tuurraq Glenn-Borade, an Iñupiaq researcher, told me how she is gathering local observations about the climate in the Alaskan Arctic to help leave a detailed record for the future. That’s what Indigenous knowledge is, she said — an understanding developed over years and years. All of these stories show how it’s about constant evolution and looking forward. Indigenous knowledge has never been set in stone, and in the face of climate change, Indigenous people are adapting more than ever. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What were some of the highlights or unexpected insights that blew you away?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that struck me is that Indigenous people have been saying and doing these things for years, so the question becomes what’s been stopping them [now]. Sometimes colonialism can seem abstract, but there are so many clear examples, whether that’s systemic racism in the Hamptons against the Shinnecock Nation or the legacy of allotment policies on the Coeur d’Alene reservation. Government policies have made it that much harder for tribes to adapt to climate change. Threats to tribal sovereignty can also be seen as threats to climate adaptation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, despite the legacy of colonialism, some of these solutions are really straightforward ideas, like bringing <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/366765/megafires-climate-indigenous-controlled-burns">good fire [also known as controlled burns] back to the land</a> after decades of fire suppression policies. There’s a lesson here that we don’t have to overcomplicate these ideas, we just have to not just listen to people who have been doing the work for generations, but support them or get out of their way.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s one lesson or takeaway that you’d like to leave readers with?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two things that I kept hearing while reporting these stories. The first is that we can’t control nature, that trying to impose our will on the environment has never worked. For the Shinnecock Nation on Long Island, for example, they understand that no matter what they do, they can’t stop the water from rising. So they are working with that knowledge to find a solution that will work for their community.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second is that we need to be thinking more long-term. The real change is going to take generations. A number of the Indigenous people I spoke to for this series talked about how they don’t expect to see the results of their work in their lifetimes, but they believe in it anyway. People in the Coeur d’Alene Tribe talked about how the previous generation of tribal leaders fought for legal justice but never saw the fruits of their labor, and now this generation understands they may not be around to see the salmon fully return, or their wetland restoration completed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;I think that kind of commitment to an effort that you may never see completed is something we could all learn from.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This story is the fourth feature in a Vox special project,&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/372001/changing-with-our-climate">Changing With Our Climate</a><em>, a limited-run series exploring Indigenous solutions to extreme weather rooted in history — and the future.</em></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-none">Last October, Aiyana James attended her first water potato harvest on the reservation of the Coeur d’Alene Tribe in northwestern Idaho. The weather was unusually cold, but she was determined to harvest her first water potatoes, a small wetland tuber that’s one of the tribe’s key traditional foods. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The smell of smoke and drying elk meat filled the air along the shore of Lake Coeur d’Alene, where the tribe set up food booths and educational stations. She waded into the frigid water barefoot to dig for the small tubers, while back on land, tribal members cooked them in a traditional pit bake, where elk, camas (a flowering plant with edible bulbs), and other locally harvested foods are layered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">James, who grew up in Portland, Oregon, and spent summers and school breaks on the reservation, was excited to take part in the harvest for the first time after moving to the reservation after college. But something was wrong: Early-season snow dampened the harvest, and although it was only a light dusting, tribal leaders spoke during the opening prayers about how unusual the conditions were. It had been a dry summer, and the water potato harvest was bad, something that has been happening more and more in recent years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I know that this isn’t supposed to be how it is,” James said. “Deep down within me, I&#8217;m like, ‘This just doesn’t feel right.’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After their land in northwest Idaho was carved up by 1909 <a href="https://www.cdatribe-nsn.gov/#:~:text=Allotment%20Act,-1909&amp;text=For%20a%20time%20the%20Coeur,find%20new%20ways%20to%20prosper">federal allotment policies</a>, <a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-03/documents/cour_dalene_final_wetland_program_plan_december_2017.pdf">Western agriculture, and logging</a> thatback persists on some level today, the Coeur d’Alene Tribe lost a massive amount of acreage and, with it, their ability to manage the land and maintain balance between environmental protection and economic development. Salmon and trout disappeared from the streams. Fires became more frequent and powerful. Water potatoes and other key plants like camas, once staple foods for tribal members, started to disappear. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, extreme drought is making the situation even worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this is part of a reinforcing cycle of land degradation and climate change that the Coeur d’Alene Tribe has been fighting for decades. It’s a fight that James has now joined as one of the tribe’s first climate resilience coordinators.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To protect their land and community, the Coeur d’Alene are in the middle of an ongoing, multi-decade effort that relies, in part, on elder knowledge to restore an important wetland.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tribe is bringing back beavers and salmon, restoring native grasses, and repairing stream channels. Collectively, those efforts are designed to restore balance to the landscape, make it more resilient to future climate change by fostering interconnected ecosystems, and, tribal members hope, one day allow them to rely again on important ancestral foods like the water potato.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’ve been living off of the foods that are on our land for thousands upon thousands of years,” James said. “Reconnecting with that food reconnects us with our land.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Bring back the water potato, help the climate</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Across the country, ecological restoration is increasingly seen as a key part of the fight against climate change, and wetlands provide an especially important service in an era of global warming: They absorb carbon from the atmosphere. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the Coeur d’Alene tribe, a healthy wetland signifies a way to curb rising temperatures that will provide the basis for the return of a rich food source and a traditional way of life. That a wetland serves as the lynchpin means that the tribe is taking on the restoration of an ecosystem that is especially threatened as the world’s climate trends hotter and more arid. Because wetlands are areas where water is at or near the surface for large parts of the year, severe bouts of drought made more common by climate change threaten their existence.<br><br>According to the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/press-release/2024-03/continued-decline-wetlands-documented-new-us-fish-and-wildlife-service-report">US Fish and Wildlife Service,</a> more than half of the wetlands in the lower 48 states are gone, and the rate of loss is only accelerating. Between 2009 and 2019, an area of vegetated wetlands in the US the combined size of Rhode Island disappeared. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s an overarching effort underway to help these imperiled landscapes. The 2022 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act <a href="https://www.doi.gov/priorities/investing-americas-infrastructure/ecosystem-restoration">included $1.4 billion</a> for ecosystem restoration and resilience, while President Joe Biden also <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/5/7/22423139/biden-30-by-30-conservation-initiative-historic">signed</a> an executive order setting a national goal to conserve at least 30 percent of the country’s lands and waters by 2030. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Coeur d’Alene aren’t alone in their focus on restoration, but they’re especially good at it. And their uniquely patient, humble approach could serve as a model for other communities working to restore the environment and prepare for climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tribal knowledge and expertise is especially important for restoration because Indigenous people are the ones who know what the land was like before it was degraded and what techniques will help restore it. The thread that ties it all together is traditional food, like the water potato. These cultural foods build connections between people and land and act as an especially tangible measuring stick of the impact that those connections can have on the environment. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">James says that camas, for example, grows better when it is regularly harvested.<strong> </strong>But because so much Coeur d’Alene land is now owned by non-Indigenous people, tribal members often don’t have access to camas fields, and some that have been unattended for years are now suffering.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We need these foods, but they also need us to flourish and to grow and get better,” she said. “If we do these things right and we focus on restoring our relationship and restoring our connection with our culture, sovereignty, and traditions, then that’s going to have lasting effects.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>An environmental restoration — and a cultural one, too</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the Coeur d’Alene reservation, soil health and biodiversity have declined, the water temperature is rising, and extreme weather like heat waves and drought are increasingly frequent. But the tribe’s restoration work is beginning to pay off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the summer of 2022, an <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2022/jul/13/an-adult-chinook-is-swimming-in-hangman-creek-for-/?utm_campaign=Rockies%20Today&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Revue%20newsletter#:~:text=Pacific%20NW-,An%20adult%20chinook%20is%20swimming%20in%20Hangman%20Creek%20for%20the,2022%20at%2011%3A25%20a.m">adult salmon swam in Hangman Creek</a> for the first time in around 100 years. Two years after the tribe released juvenile salmon into the creek, and after an arduous journey out to the Pacific Ocean and back, the tribe welcomed salmon back to the creek for the first time in generations.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Ralph Allan Jr., the tribe’s fish and wildlife program manager, it was the culmination of 20 years of work that began with long days of fieldwork like planting trees. Now, he’s leading the department as it prepares to bring salmon back to the reservation. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Allan is also working to plant the seeds for a new generation of restoration advocates. He has led an internship program to get college students out in the field and three tribal members are currently enrolled in fish and wildlife degree programs. At the water potato harvest, Allan makes sure that department staff are working with the youth, showing them how to harvest the potatoes and pulling the kids out of the mud when they get stuck. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This cultural and community work is part of the tribe’s restoration effort. Allan worries that the tribe’s younger generation is not as connected to the land as he was growing up. “We&#8217;re not just reintroducing the species of salmon back to our people,” he said. “We&#8217;ve lost that cultural connection to the salmon as well, so we&#8217;re reintroducing a whole culture of salmon.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While salmon are a priority, they are just one piece of a complicated, interconnected ecosystem the tribe is working to restore. Take <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/23333298/beaver-dams-ecosystem-climate-change-cooling">beaver dams</a>. Dams raise the water table, extend the area along the banks of a river or lake that more animals and plants can inhabit, and keep more water on the landscape. All of this makes the area more welcoming to salmon and other wildlife, but also makes the landscape more resilient to drought and extreme heat because wetlands absorb and retain water that is released during drier periods, explains Tyler Opp, the tribe’s wetlands coordinator. </p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vox wp-block-embed-vox"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Why beavers matter as the planet heats up" src="https://volume.vox-cdn.com/embed/1ea6aec5a?autoplay=false&#038;loop=true&#038;placement=article&#038;player_type=youtube&#038;tracking=article:middle" allowfullscreen allow="encrypted-media;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The beaver dams also support clean, cold-water habitats for salmon, but to do that, they need trees. Since 2019, the tribe’s environmental programs department has planted over 18,000 trees from about a dozen different species, and plans to plant another 4,000 by 2025. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tribe has used beaver dam analogs — man-made approximations — to encourage beavers to return and posts to reinforce existing beaver dams. Gerald Green, a wildlife biologist for the tribe, says they are currently supporting about seven beaver dams in the creek. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trees, beavers, salmon, water — they’re all part of a cyclical, interdependent system the tribe is trying to restore and support. Cajetan Matheson, natural resource director and a tribal council member, says that addressing climate impacts or restoration goals one by one will not work. “Everything is really related to each other,” Matheson said. “You can&#8217;t just clear-cut a mountain and say, ‘Oh, now we&#8217;ve defeated the fire problem.’ There&#8217;s way more to it than that.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These projects take time. Tyler Opp says that even though the scale of the work that needs to be done can be overwhelming, the tribe’s approach helps keep things in perspective. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By keeping longer-term goals in mind, like bringing salmon back, which could take decades, the tribe avoids Band-Aid solutions. The whole tribal government buys into this approach, year after year and generation to generation, and although the tribe is limited by funding and capacity, like many public agencies, this commitment allows them to focus on projects that will contribute to achieving that long-term vision. Despite the constraints, the tribe can unify behind a shared vision of the future, based on their collective history, knowledge, and appreciation for the land. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The tribe is able to prioritize things on a far longer time scale than state and federal agencies,” he said. “The tribe doesn&#8217;t have to think in terms of the next budget cycle for getting work done. All of [the things we are doing] are done for future generations.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Almost everyone I talked to in the Natural Resources Department credits that perspective to Felix Aripa, a tribal elder who <a href="https://ictnews.org/archive/coeur-dalene-historian-world-war-ii-vet-walks-on">died in 2016</a>. He is seen as instrumental in setting the tone for the tribe’s restoration work. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even Aiyana James, who never had the chance to meet him, says she’s listened to old tapes of Aripa. He was an early proponent of using beavers as a restoration partner and helped with things as straightforward as pointing out where a stream used to flow so that the technicians could use that as a guideline to restore the course rather than starting from scratch or guesswork. “The ultimate goal for anybody that works here in the Fish and Wildlife Program is to leave a legacy the way that Felix Aripa left his legacy and his mark on the program,” Allan said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before he passed away, Aripa helped Matheson and others put the tribe’s traditional seasonal calendar on paper. The calendar, which is based on seasonal indicators like tree sap rather than months and days, includes detailed information about foods, ecosystems, plants, animals, and human activities. “As we&#8217;re thinking broadly about how we approach restoration, it&#8217;s the framework that we can use,” Laura Laumatia, the tribe’s environmental programs manager, said. “It represents millennia of knowledge.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So while the tribe is proud of their progress, they are still working for the future. “I think it&#8217;s nice to work for 20 years in the same place because you do see some changes happening,” Laumatia said. “But we know that the fruits of our labor are really going to be 70 years from now.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Social Security reform” is one of those soundbites you might hear every election cycle without anything ever changing. Politicians have been sounding the alarm for decades, saying that the program — which helps retirees, people with disabilities, and their families stay afloat — is quickly running out of money. So what’s actually at stake?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Social Security is a pay-as-you go system, so taxes collected from today’s workers are spent on current beneficiaries. But because the workforce hasn’t grown as fast as the number of baby boomers entering retirement, there’s more being taken out of Social Security than being put in. The federal government relies on <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/understanding-the-social-security-trust-funds">trust funds</a> to fill the gaps, but those reserves are projected to be entirely depleted by 2035, according to the <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL33028">Congressional Research Service</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That doesn’t mean that the government won’t have any money left. But if Congress doesn’t do anything before those reserves are gone, the government will only be able to honor 83 percent of the scheduled benefits, which means that most, if not all, recipients of Social Security will see their household incomes fall. (By 2098, the government would only be able to cover <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RL/RL33028">73 percent</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That outcome would be disastrous for many. Since it was established in 1935, Social Security has been a hugely successful welfare program, and each year, it helps <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/374488/ending-poverty-america-policy-choice">more than 20 million people</a> stay above the poverty line. It has never before been unable to pay out scheduled benefits. But if Congress doesn’t act, the number of Social Security beneficiaries who live below the poverty line <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/if-social-security-runs-out-money-poverty-among-older-adults-and-people-disabilities">could increase by more than 50 percent</a> by 2045, disproportionately impacting Black and Hispanic families.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is inevitable, and lawmakers will eventually have to do something to address the shortfall. The question is what.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What Democrats and Republicans have proposed</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Congress has no choice but to raise revenue, make cuts to the program, or some combination of the two. Democrats have called for raising taxes and, in some cases, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/icymi-warren-sanders-colleagues-introduce-legislation-to-expand-social-security-by-2400-a-year-and-extend-solvency-for-75-years">expanding benefits</a>, while Republicans have mostly <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2024/06/social-security-line-half-billion-dollar-cut-house-gop-funding-bill/397722/">advocated for cuts</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent years, however, the GOP has promised that it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKeYcFk3bTQ">won’t cut people’s benefits</a>. Over the years, Donald Trump, for example, has advised <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-warns-us-house-republicans-not-touch-social-security-medicare-2023-01-20/">his fellow Republicans</a> that trying to gut Social Security is bad politics (though he’s also called the program’s disability insurance <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/clinton-disabilities-speech/500954/">“a racket”</a>). &nbsp;On the campaign trail this time around, <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/politics/trump-on-social-security-and-medicare">he’s promised</a> to neither “cut one penny from Social Security” nor raise the retirement age, as many Republicans have proposed doing in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Trump’s promises don’t add up to an actual plan. He <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/politics/trump-on-social-security-and-medicare">proposed reducing spending</a> on Social Security in each of his annual budgets while in office. And despite his promises, he has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/11/politics/trump-entitlements-social-security-medicare/index.html">suggested that he’s open</a> to Social Security cuts this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump also recently proposed cutting taxes on Social Security payments. That might sound good because people will net more money when they receive their benefits. But the reality is more complicated. The <a href="https://www.kiplinger.com/politics/trump-on-social-security-and-medicare">poorest households wouldn’t see any change</a> under that plan because Social Security benefits for those making below $32,000 are already untaxed, while the richest recipients would be more likely to see a tax cut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For her part, Vice President Kamala Harris has, like other Democrats, promised to preserve Social Security benefits, <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/">vowing to shore up the program</a> and make sure it stays solvent. She promises to do so by <a href="https://kamalaharris.com/issues/">making</a> “millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share in taxes.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Harris’s plan is light on the details, and isn’t exactly clear how the federal government will be able to raise enough revenue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What might Social Security reform actually look like?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no way around it: Lawmakers have to raise taxes on many families, including those who aren’t millionaires. Right now, any income that someone <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/retirement/planner/maxtax.html">makes above $168,000</a> is not taxed for Social Security. That means that higher earners pay a smaller share of their income toward funding Social Security than lower- and middle-income earners.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are shocked to learn that rich people don&#8217;t pay taxes above” the cap, said Monique Morrissey, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To address this, President Biden has tried to reintroduce the Social Security tax on <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/3/6/biden-social-security">income above $400,000</a>. That weird formula simply boiled down to politics: Biden pledged to not raise taxes on any household making less than $400,000. But it creates what some experts call a doughnut hole — a pile of untaxable income between the cap and $400,000, and on its own, that’s <a href="https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2020/3/6/biden-social-security">not enough to fill</a> the anticipated budget shortfall. But if Democrats are serious about raising revenue for Social Security, they should start considering raising taxes on everybody. It might not be as unpopular as they fear.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The Democrats really need to lose that pledge” of not raising taxes on anyone making less than $400,000, Morrissey said. “People are happy to pay more in taxes when it’s something that they see is concretely benefiting them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Indeed, polls show that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/546890/americans-upbeat-future-social-security-benefits.aspx">the majority of Americans</a> support raising taxes to ensure they receive Social Security benefits, and only 31 percent would opt for making cuts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A modest payroll tax increase for Social Security would have little impact on most households and would greatly benefit the program. Moreover, Congress ought to consider expanding the categories of income that get taxed for Social Security, <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/if-social-security-runs-out-money-poverty-among-older-adults-and-people-disabilities">including investment income</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Raising taxes, however, is not an easy task, especially when those taxes are targeted at the wealthy. And if Congress fails to raise enough revenue, then it has to start looking at cuts to benefits. “It’s perfectly reasonable to think about solving a problem with some mix of revenue increases as well as benefit reductions,” said Gopi Shah Goda, director of the Retirement Security Project at the Brookings Institution.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a cost-saving measure, benefits don’t have to be reduced across the board. If Congress lifts the cap on taxable income, for example, it doesn’t necessarily have to increase the maximum benefit that’s paid out to those who contribute the most into the system. And some of the additional revenue from the new taxes could be targeted to expand benefits for those —&nbsp;like surviving spouses or children —&nbsp;who rely on Social Security the most to stay out of poverty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, a program like Social Security should ensure that none of its recipients fall into poverty, especially because those who are retired or disabled have limited sources of income. That’s certainly a program worth spending more money on — and <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/546890/americans-upbeat-future-social-security-benefits.aspx">the majority of Americans agree</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When you think of what makes us human, would you say it’s our powers of prediction?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I probably wouldn’t have, at least not until my conversation with Mark Miller, a philosopher of cognition and research fellow at both the University of Toronto and Monash University in Melbourne. He studies how new ideas about the mind can provide insight into human well-being.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prediction is clearly useful: Being able to anticipate the future helps us strategize in the present.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But too much predictive power is usually the stuff of dystopian sci-fi stories, where being creative and unpredictable are the hallmarks of humanity, while the power of prediction —&nbsp;like the trope of an all-knowing algorithm — is cast as the weapon of technology.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, one of the latest big theories in neuroscience says that humans are fundamentally creatures of prediction, and not only is creativity not at odds with that, but it actually goes hand in hand with improving our predictive power. Life itself, in this view, is one big process of creatively optimizing prediction as a survival strategy in a universe otherwise tending toward chaos.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Miller’s work starts with this big idea known as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/04/02/the-mind-expanding-ideas-of-andy-clark">predictive processing</a>, which says that your experience of the world is like a dream — a simulated model constructed by your brain. We’re not observing the world through open windows in our skulls. Rather, in our brain’s pursuit to plan, survive, and achieve our goals, it has learned how to guess what the world is actually like based on incoming sensory data. Those predictions are always uncertain, at least to a degree, which is why the goal of predictive processing is often <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/predictive-processing">described</a> as minimizing that uncertainty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But an optimal relationship with uncertainty calls for a balance. Through a predictive lens, Miller argues, uncertainty can help us snap out of harmful loops, like depression or addiction. And in general, it turns out that one of the best ways to become healthier, more adaptive creatures is to regularly expose ourselves to different kinds of uncertainty.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Miller’s work goes on to use this idea to explain the value of everything from art and horror movies to meditation and psychedelics. In each case, we’re brought to “the edge of informational chaos,” where our predictive models begin to break down. Surprisingly, he sees creativity and optimizing our predictive powers as complementary forces that help sustain life itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So I invited Miller as the next guest for <em>The Gray Area</em>’s series on creativity to discuss the paradox of how we humans survive thanks to prediction but need chaos in order to thrive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“All of life is this resistance to entropy,” Miller said. “As the universe expands and entropy is inevitable, life is that single force that’s defying that gradient.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>The following excerpt has been edited for length and clarity. Listen to the full </em>Gray Area<em> interview <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/your-mind-needs-chaos/id1081584611?i=1000672316807">here</a>.</em></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, I&#8217;m looking out my window and I see a particular scene and, naively, it seems to me like the light is coming in from the outside, into my body, reaching my brain, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m seeing. What you&#8217;re telling me is actually what I&#8217;m seeing is the model being predicted by my brain. What happens, though, when the light actually does get passed through my body? Am I experiencing that at any point, or when do we switch from experiencing our predictions of the world to raw sensory data?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Probably never. That&#8217;s just not what you&#8217;re built to do. And actually you don&#8217;t need access to it. What you need is the driving signal from the world to be making sure that the models that you&#8217;re generating are elegant, sophisticated, and tracking real-world dynamics.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This does get dizzying the more you think about it. But this is a huge claim: that my experience of the world is not a direct experience of objective reality. It is my brain&#8217;s best guess of the world outside of my skull. How early-stage is predictive processing as a theory?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, not that early. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s irresponsible to say that it&#8217;s the preeminent theory today in all sorts of communities, computational <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(23)00411-X/abstract">psychiatry</a>, computational psychology, <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pcn.13138">neuroscience</a>. I mean, if it&#8217;s not the foremost theory, it&#8217;s adjacent. So I guess it&#8217;s a mix. It&#8217;s younger than the other, it is the new kid on the block in a way, but it&#8217;s a very popular new kid and very exciting.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You wrote a paper about how this predictive framework can explain a lot about what makes us humans happy. So tell me about that. What is the predictive account of happiness?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The human system starts predicting for one reason or another that the world is some way. And then the trouble looks like when that prediction becomes strong enough and divergent enough from the way things actually are. So we call it sticky — it has a sticky quality to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just think about depression. You&#8217;ve installed the belief for whatever reason that you just can&#8217;t fit with the world, that either it&#8217;s because you are not good enough or the world isn&#8217;t good enough. But for some reason you can&#8217;t resolve this difference between the way that you want the world to be and the way the world actually is, either because of something on your side or something on the world’s side. One thing that marks depression is that that belief persists even if the conditions were to change. Even if you were to change the situation entirely, there&#8217;s a sticky quality to these pathologies.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So let me ask you then about swinging back to the positive dimension, happiness in particular. That&#8217;s a picture of depression and psychopathology and mental illness. So what does this predictive framework say about the feeling of happiness itself?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I&#8217;m going to say two things. There&#8217;s a difference between momentary subjective happiness and well-being, like having a good life.&nbsp;Just in case anybody doesn&#8217;t know what these are, the momentary subjective being well-being is like hedonic well-being. That&#8217;s just the feeling good stuff.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow &nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is that like pleasure?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Exactly. Overall well-being doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s exactly identical with that because to have a really rich, meaningful, good life may mean you&#8217;re in pain quite a lot. Momentary subjective well-being is a reflection, at least in part, of predicting better than expected. So we have this idea that valence is that good or bad feeling that comes as part of your embodied system telling you how it&#8217;s going. So when you feel good, that&#8217;s your body and nervous system and brain telling you, “I&#8217;ve got it. Whatever&#8217;s happening right now, I&#8217;m on top of it. I&#8217;m predicting it for us. I&#8217;m predicting it well. I&#8217;m managing uncertainty really well.” And when you feel bad, that&#8217;s an indicator: “I don&#8217;t understand something here.”</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How does creativity fit into this story?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think a starting point for thinking about creativity using this model is to start by maybe showing a puzzle. Why would a predictive system that looks like it&#8217;s trying to reduce uncertainty be attracted to situations and indeed make those situations where it&#8217;s bumping into uncertainty? Like why do we build roller coasters? Why do we go to horror movies?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the answer is that too much certainty is a problem for us, especially when that certainty drifts from real-world dynamics. So in order to protect our prediction engine, our brain and nervous system, from getting into what we&#8217;ve called the bad bootstrap, that is from getting very, very certain about something that&#8217;s wrong, it really behooves us to occasionally inject ourselves with enough uncertainty, with enough intellectual humility to be uncertain about your model enough that you can check to see whether or not you&#8217;ve been stuck in one of these bad bootstraps.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you&#8217;re with me to there, then we have a wonderful first-principles approach to thinking about the benefit of creativity and art, especially provocative art that calls you to rethink who you are. Because as far as we&#8217;ve seen, the research just keeps pointing in this direction, anything that gets you out of your ordinary mode of interacting with the world so that you can check to see how good it is or how poor it is, is gonna be a benefit for us. It&#8217;s gonna protect us from those bad siloed opportunities. I think art does that, right?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can go somewhere, see something grand, see something beautiful, see something ugly and horrible. If you let yourself be impressed by it, it can be an opportunity for you to be jostled out of your ordinary way of seeing the world, which would let the system check to see whether or not it&#8217;s running optimal models or not.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it sounds like you&#8217;re likening creativity to this injection of the right kind of uncertainty into our experience of the world. And in your <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rstb.2022.0425">paper on horror movies</a>, you used a term that I think captures a lot of this. It&#8217;s a thread that seems to run through everything so far: art, creativity, horror movies, even meditation and psychedelics. You wrote that the brain evolved to seek out the “edge of informational chaos” — a place where our predictive models begin to break down, and in those uncertain zones, we actually have much to learn.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It sounds to me like this edge of chaos actually explains at least one perspective on why art, why creativity, why play, why all these things benefit us. Because that edge is a really healthy place to be. So I wanted to ask you about this framing of the edge of informational chaos and why that&#8217;s a place that our brains would want to go.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Where are we gonna learn the most? If you are a learning system, and this is amazing, right from the lab, we see that animals and us, we get rewarded, not only when we get fed and watered and sexed, we get rewarded when we get better information. Isn&#8217;t that amazing to acknowledge?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you get better information, my system is treating it like I&#8217;ve been fed. That&#8217;s how important good information is for us. And in fact, in lots of situations, it&#8217;s more rewarding for us than the food itself because one bit of food is one thing. Information about how to get food over time, that could be much, much more important. So where do we learn the most?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, we don&#8217;t learn where our predictive models are so refined that everything is just being done by rote. And we&#8217;re not learning the most way out in deep volatility, unexpected uncertainty environments. That&#8217;s like where not only do you not know what&#8217;s going on, but you don&#8217;t know how to get to knowing what&#8217;s going on. That&#8217;s why we sometimes have culture shock if we move somewhere else.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So where do we learn the most? We learn at this Goldilocks zone, which is that healthy boundary between order and chaos, right at the edge where our predictive models necessarily break down. And the hope there is that in breaking down, new, better models are possible.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;ve talked about how art and creativity can bring us to that edge of chaos, but you&#8217;ve also said elsewhere that meditation can do a similar kind of thing. Which is confusing at first because meditation looks pretty different from watching a horror movie. In meditation, I&#8217;m sitting there very quietly, in what looks like the opposite of chaos. So how do you understand what meditation is doing in this predictive framework, and how does that relate to creativity and these beneficial kinds of uncertainty?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This idea is common now, especially, in the West, that meditation might be more about relaxation, or maybe addressing stress. But that’s not the meat of the program. The center of that program is a deep, profound, and progressive investigation about the nature of who we are and how our own minds work. It’s a deep investigation about the way our emotional system is structured and the nature of our unconscious experience. What are we experiencing? Why are we experiencing it? What does that have to do with the world?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then we can adjust, progressively and skillfully, the shape of who and what we are so that we fit the world better, so that we are as close as possible to what’s real and true, so that we can be as serviceable as possible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, you can do everything that we’ve been talking about, including all the stuff that psychedelics do for the predictive system, all the stuff that horror and violent video games do, you can do it all contemplatively, in a way that’s better for you.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So you’re saying that one way to find that thread that puts meditation and horror movies in the same vein of practice is thinking about meditation and psychedelics as injecting uncertainty into our experience of the world. Is that the common currency there?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You&#8217;ve got it. Absolutely.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Oshan Jarow</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let me ask you this. After this whole story we&#8217;ve unpacked, there&#8217;s still a tension that leaves me a little bit uncomfortable. It feels like we&#8217;re saying that creativity is just kind of an input or a means toward juicing the powers of prediction. And part of me pushes against that. It almost feels reductive, right? Is creativity really just this evolutionary strategy that makes us better predictive creatures? Does that make creativity feel less intrinsically valuable?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because when I think about creativity, at least in part it doesn&#8217;t just feel like a tool for survival that evolution has honed. Sometimes it feels like it’s that which makes life worth living, that it has intrinsic value of its own. Not as a tool for the predictive powers in my brain or the algorithms or whatever. So I&#8217;m curious if you feel this tension at all, and how you think about creativity being framed in the service of prediction.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Mark Miller</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So two things. One, even though we are excited by this new framework, I don&#8217;t think we need to be afraid of it being overly reductionistic. I mean, in a way, it&#8217;s radically reductionistic. We&#8217;re saying that everything that&#8217;s happening in the brain can be written on a T-shirt, basically.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the way that it actually gets implemented in super complex, beautiful systems like us, it shouldn&#8217;t make us feel like all of the wonderful human endeavors are simply explainable in a sort of overly simplified way. I don&#8217;t have any worry like that. I think if it turned out that life was operating over a simple principle of optimization —&nbsp;that&#8217;s the most beautiful thing I&#8217;ve ever heard, first of all, that all of life is about optimization. All of life is this resistance to entropy. That&#8217;s just what it is to be alive, is just your optimal resistance to entropy. As the universe expands and entropy is inevitable, life is that single force that&#8217;s defying that gradient. That&#8217;s so beautiful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Two, when it comes to art, I want to even be careful to say that art is only about finding this critical edge. I think that&#8217;s one really interesting way of thinking about it. It&#8217;s one way that we&#8217;ve been thinking about it, if you consider movies and video games as forms of art also.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another central reason that this kind of system might benefit from artistic expression that we didn&#8217;t cover but that&#8217;s completely relevant for our discussion is that art creates this wonderful opportunity for endless uncertainty and uncertainty management. And not very many things do that.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And as you progressively create dancing, painting, singing, whatever, the enthusiasm of that literally being in the spirit of that creative endeavor, is you managing uncertainty in a new and remarkable way that it&#8217;s never been done before in all of existence through all time. Nobody has ever encountered and resolved that uncertainty in particular. So it should be endlessly rewarding, fascinating.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No wonder we find it so beautiful. It might be by its very nature the purest expression of uncertainty generation and management. That would make it intrinsically valuable for an uncertainty-minimizing system like us.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the afternoon of October 10, author and influencer <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2019/9/11/20860607/caroline-calloway-natalie-beach-explained">Caroline Calloway</a> texted me “I lived bitch.” She posted a screenshot of the same proof-of-life selfie and message on her Instagram story that morning after Hurricane Milton made landfall. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We&#8217;d spoken one day earlier about Calloway&#8217;s decision not to evacuate for the monster of a storm, as well as to post about that choice on social media, and at one point I asked if she thought she was going to die. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&#8220;Someday,&#8221; she told me, &#8220;We all are.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, she was aware of the massive storm surges Milton would bring in its wake that would likely wash away parts of the state. She knew it would inflict a wretched amount of emotional and monetary damage.<strong> </strong>For now, we don’t know Milton’s total devastation, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/10/hurricane-milton-live-updates-florida-aftermath-thursday/75599239007/">but as it stands</a> at least 14 people are dead and 3 million people are without power. Milton also spawned “dozens” of tornadoes across the state, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-tornadoes-florida-deaths-climate-change-oceans-f197c258022c189c6ce8bc59dc88223e">according to the Associated Press</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It was a really hard choice to stay or to go. And I didn&#8217;t make it lightly,” she told me, “But you know, if I can be of service in terms of entertainment on the internet? So be it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Calloway isn’t the only Floridian evacuation refuser who’s posting through it. On TikTok in particular, there are plenty. There’s the woman who told her followers that she was instructed to have enough food and water for three days and has decided that she will have “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@angeyb__/video/7423331321398988078">some kind of barbecue</a>” (<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@angeyb__/video/7424308233575222571">she posted </a>that she was safe on Thursday evening). There’s a Floridian celebrity who goes by the name “<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/10/lt-dan-tiktok-hurricane-milton-sailor/75602596007/">Lt. Dan</a>” who safely rode out the storm on his boat. And then there’s the woman who did not want to <a href="https://x.com/offbeatorbit/status/1843851943434961039">leave her gigantic concrete house</a> because she wanted to “save” it and partly because her staying would, in her words, “piss” liberals off. (Her account now shows up as “<a href="https://x.com/alex_abads/status/1844573838694064482">banned</a>” on TikTok.)  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People defying evacuation orders isn’t a new phenomenon. But getting millions of views on TikTok for doing so is. So why are these people staying? And why are they posting?&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The psychology behind staying and posting through a hurricane</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the most important things to know about StormTok is that having the ability to leave and deciding to stay behind is a choice that most people who <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/377365/hurricane-milton-helene-evacuation-cost-expensive#">do not evacuate don’t have</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The real story is that most people who don&#8217;t evacuate can&#8217;t evacuate. Evacuation is expensive,” <a href="https://www.bsu.edu/academics/collegesanddepartments/geography-meteorology/about-us/facultyandstaff/calldavid">Dave Call</a>, a meteorologist and storm chaser based at Ball State University, tells me. Call explains scenarios in which people can’t take off from work, can’t afford hotels, don’t have reliable transportation, and can’t afford meals. Factors like not being able to speak English and being an undocumented immigrant also affect those contingency plans. Evacuation isn’t a feasible option for these people, and we rarely see their stories, Call stresses. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Being able to stay and share what’s happening is essentially a luxury.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Call chases tornadoes, and he explains that there’s a slight difference between what storm chasers do and what these hurricane posters are getting at, even if they’re both technically documenting storms. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“These people are different from tornado chasers because they aren&#8217;t driven by a desire to see exciting weather, but by other factors,” Call says. “They may not comprehend the scale of a hurricane. Some have put their lives into their home and feel that it is safe enough. There’s also overlap between these folks and those who drive through flood waters, refuse to shelter in storms, drive recklessly, etc.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What Call is getting at is that there is a multitude of factors that goes into the psychological decision of staying in place and sticking out a hurricane like Milton. <a href="https://com.miami.edu/profile/barbara-millet/">Barbara Millet</a>, an assistant professor at the University of Miami, echoes that sentiment. Part of Millet’s research has focused on disaster communication and how the public understands the <a href="https://news.miami.edu/faculty/stories/2022/11/that-uncanny-coneresearchers-want-to-erase-the-uncertainty.html">dangers and risk of hurricanes</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Evacuation decisions are complex. They&#8217;re multifaceted and they&#8217;re personal. There&#8217;s no single reason, but rather a combination of factors that really influence individuals and families,” Millet tells Vox. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She explains that these factors range from money to past experiences with hurricane evacuations to uncertainty about the forecast, to the perception that being at home might be safer. Disaster fatigue, the exhaustive process of rebuilding, the lack of trust in lawmakers and officials, and everything in between can affect someone’s decision not to obey evacuation protocols. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Maybe all these reasons don&#8217;t apply to any one given person, but there&#8217;s certainly a combination of them that influence people&#8217;s decisions to — or not to — evacuate,” Millet adds. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If there’s a reassuring aspect to these extremely viral videos of people hunkering down and ignoring evac orders, it’s that the reasons and motivations they’re citing line up with research. Scientists know that factors like expenses and lack of trust in officials are why people don’t evacuate and have been figuring out better ways to address those concerns. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The reasons that they were giving are the same reasons that turn up in most of our surveys. None of the stated reasons were a surprise in those videos,” says <a href="https://humanecology.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/cara-cuite/">Cara Cuite</a>, an associate professor at Rutgers University who studies risk and emergency communication. What caught Cuite and her colleagues by surprise was how popular the videos became. They wondered if that engagement could be another driving force in people’s decision-making.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Seeing these videos raises the question of whether there is a counterproductive incentive to stay and not evacuate in the form of driving engagement to people&#8217;s accounts,” Cuite adds. “We don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s happening, but it certainly raises that question.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In that same vein, what worries Millet and Call is that people posting their refusals to evacuate and garnering millions and millions of views in the process could be one of those factors that may sway <em>someone else’</em>s decision from evacuating to staying put. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Social media provides official information to be communicated to a larger group of people, but it also allows for unofficial information and misinformation to be communicated, and that&#8217;s what worries me most,” Millet tells me. “Misinformation and how that impacts people&#8217;s ability to take decisions, actions that they need to take.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why people are turning the hurricane into content&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Calloway’s decision to stay wasn’t prompted by a lack of information. She explained that she had been following Milton and all the news surrounding the storm but that mitigating factors like her inability to drive and her desire to care for older neighbors kept her staying put. She also details that her experience evacuating in 2022 for Ian also shaped her decision. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I decided the right thing for me and my immediate community was to stay,” Calloway told me. “They&#8217;re my first priority.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She explains that she had previously honored evacuation protocols for Hurricane Ian in 2022, fleeing to her mother’s house inland in Northport, Florida, and ended up needing a military rescue anyway. She added that she’s on the third floor of her concrete condo and that she has hurricane-proof windows.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She does admit that with all these posts, she is hoping to promote her latest project (“I’m going to be trapped inside for two days anyway — let&#8217;s sell some books. That’s sort of my attitude.”) which happens to be a book about <a href="https://carolinecalloway.com/products/elizabeth-wurtzel-and-caroline-calloways-guide-to-life">survival</a>. Judging by the many posts about whether or not Calloway would survive the hurricane, ironic admiration for Calloway’s insistence on promoting her new book, and the attention her posts from Milton’s eye have garnered, she successfully provided the internet with some form of entertainment. She’s also no stranger to the dangers of misinformation, including <a href="https://x.com/jackfromohio/status/1843755693058535758">rumors</a> of her living on the ground floor of her condo, which she says were made up by a “fucking idiot who’s blind.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not lost on Calloway that there’s a certain schadenfreude or a grim morbidity from people online watching her post, that much of this attention was glibly predicated on her possible demise. </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The way the stubborn stayers on social media are consumed and recirculated speaks to both society’s rubber-necking and many viewers’ judgments about the posters’ reality. That these Floridians had the money and resources to leave and chose to stay rubs people the wrong way, but it also gets them very invested. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can’t help but be curious about the implied <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/20/18226699/jenna-jameson-keto-diet-weight-loss-photos-before-and-after">before-and-after picture</a> of it all. Some want to see if the lady’s concrete house gets wrecked or the woman having a barbecue in the wake of a storm surge realizes amid standing water that burgers and dogs are the last thing on her mind. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also the fact that, as Call, the meteorologist and storm chaser, points out, it’s simply hard to comprehend living in the destructive aftermath of a hurricane. Parts of Florida are still soaked from Helene, and it’s unclear how many days or even weeks Milton will leave the swaths of the state without electricity. Milton is going to strain Florida in ways that TikTok can’t capture. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Rebuilding from a hurricane is measured in years,” Call says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even when a life-threatening hurricane is headed your way, there are <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/25/16202296/hurricane-florence-2018-evacuation-psychology">many reasons why you might stay put</a>. You might have dependent family members who can’t leave due to disabilities or other health-related reasons; you might not have reliable transportation to get to a safer area, and what’s more, no gas to get there. Sometimes, you simply refuse to leave your home and everything you own behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s also the reality of just not being able to afford it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a 2021 <a href="https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/departments/public-affairs/documents/news-items/spa-hurricane-survey-results-2021.pdf">University of South Florida survey</a>, over half of the state’s residents said that finances would impact whether they evacuated from a hurricane or not, with almost 43 percent saying they had under $1,000 for emergencies. People escaping both Hurricane Milton and Helene — a Category 4 hurricane that heavily impacted the southeastern US in late September — report <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cnn/video/7423539550137371934">spending</a> <a href="https://x.com/DissentFu/status/1843373698243539317">hundreds</a> <a href="https://x.com/bulkpricing/status/1843734482698023161">if not</a> <a href="https://weartv.com/news/local/helene-evacuees-face-high-costs-as-they-seek-refuge-in-northwest-florida">thousands of dollars</a> to get to safety. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Connie Vickers, 63, typically resides about an hour outside of Asheville, North Carolina. It cost her about $5,000 to book the first available Airbnb she could find to evacuate from Hurricane Helene. She considers herself fortunate — she could pay that out of pocket, with the hope that her insurance would cover some or all of the cost. “I’ve been thinking about the socioeconomic differences,” she tells Vox. She knows that others aren&#8217;t able to pay these high costs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Terrifyingly, anecdotes of people seeing <a href="https://x.com/silverfang09/status/1843638806840520771">outrageous</a> <a href="https://x.com/iowaradioguy/status/1843362951593660813">flight</a>, <a href="https://x.com/hurricanetrack/status/1843482275490787568">hotel</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/KellDA/status/1843458416070783099">rental car</a> prices have spread like wildfire on social media in the lead-up to Hurricane Milton’s landfall as a Category 3 storm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On TikTok, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mamamossof6">one woman in Southwest Florida</a> has been explaining why it’s so difficult to leave home with six children and four dogs. Many shelters <a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/planprepare/disability/evacuations-and-shelters/shelter-information/sheltering-with-pet/">don’t accept pets</a>. “I would have to book an Airbnb or something,” she says in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mamamossof6/video/7422814373627940139">one video</a>. “I can’t afford to do that.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Flights, hotels, or gas can be pricey — if they’re even available</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The longer someone waits to evacuate, the costlier evacuation is likely to be. One <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264879191_Is_It_Time_to_Go_Yet_Understanding_Household_Hurricane_Evacuation_Decisions_from_a_Dynamic_Perspective">2011 study</a> estimated that evacuation costs for a Category 3 hurricane could increase from $454 about three days before expected landfall to $526 mere hours before landfall, which is about $632 to $732 in today’s dollars. While the cheapest one-way flight from Tampa to Atlanta in mid-November can be had for just $39, according to Google Flights, on October 8, the cheapest the search engine showed was $321. The cheapest one-way ticket from Tampa to NYC, usually available for $45 to $90, was $458.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plane tickets are priced dynamically, typically shooting up during busy travel periods and when you’re booking last-minute. A United spokesperson told Vox that the airline had implemented fare caps this past Sunday. “Since then, the average price for a one way, economy class ticket to our hubs from affected Florida markets was below $500,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. They also noted that the <a href="https://x.com/iowaradioguy/status/1843362951593660813/photo/1">viral screenshots</a> of $1,000-plus fares from Tampa to St. Louis included two stops. By early Tuesday, though, it was hard to find any nonstop flights from Tampa. <a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-waiving-fare-differences-capping-fares-new-bookings-ahead-milton">Delta</a> and <a href="https://skift.com/2024/10/09/airlines-cap-fares-during-hurricane-milton/">American Airlines</a> have also capped fares.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether these tickets actually existed is also a different matter — going directly to airline websites often showed that there were actually no available flights, since airports were closed and many flights had been canceled. By Tuesday, when many <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/09/florida-hurricane-milton-evacuation-orders-flood-zones-mandatory-list-map-orlando-counties-shelters/75588425007/">evacuation orders</a> were just going into effect, options were increasingly limited — and costly — for Floridians in the path of Milton. Many airports were <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/airports-close-and-flights-are-cancelled-due-to-hurricane-milton/3438303/">closing down</a>. As of Wednesday, FlightAware data showed that 90 percent of flights out of Tampa International Airport were canceled.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rental car locations were either running out of cars or shutting down for safety as of Tuesday, and <a href="https://www.gasbuddy.com/home?search=tampa&amp;fuel=1&amp;method=all&amp;maxAge=0">according to GasBuddy</a>, a site that helps people track prices and availability at nearby gas stations, fuel was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/08/business/hurricane-milton-florida-gasoline-shortages/index.html">scarce</a>. Finding a place to stay is an uphill climb, too. At the time of writing, many hotels in <a href="https://www.mypanhandle.com/news/local-news/bay-county/panama-city/hurricane-milton-evacuees-fully-book-panama-city-hotels/">Northwest</a> <a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/hurricane/2024/10/07/booked-up-tallahassee-hotels-see-influx-due-to-hurricane-milton/75555745007/">Florida</a> had filled up. While there are free shelters available across Florida counties where evacuation orders have been issued, as well as free <a href="https://www.floridadisaster.org/Updates">shuttle services</a> or other <a href="https://www.wptv.com/weather/hurricane/need-transportation-heres-how-you-can-get-a-ride-to-a-local-shelter-or-to-safety">free transportations options</a>, not everyone may be in an area where they can access them. There are also several reasons why people choose <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/today/2024/10/09/evacuating-privilege-why-some-stay-behind-when-hurricanes-strike">not to go to a shelter</a>: They may not be sure exactly where it’s located, whether it’s full, or may not be able to bring their pets. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Being poor and having few job protections makes it harder to escape a storm</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People with the least money are also often <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5050132/">least likely to be able to escape</a> a natural disaster. They are less able to leave work in advance to beat traffic or book lodgings and flights before they’re all sold out, and in the long term, less able to permanently move to an area at lower risk of hurricanes — yet another example of how it can be <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-cost-of-being-poor-is-rising-and-its-worse-for-poor-families-of-color/">more expensive to be poor</a>. The Gulf Coast faces some of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4022458/">highest poverty rates</a> in the US, and the combination of extreme poverty and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK600389/">higher rates of poor health</a> (often due to racial inequality and environmental factors) leaves residents in this region <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-part-of-the-u-s-will-suffer-most-from-climate-change/">especially vulnerable</a> during disasters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Carson MacPherson-Krutsky, a research associate at the Natural Hazards Center at University of Colorado Boulder, is currently studying the factors that motivate people to evacuate and shelter — or not — for hurricanes and tornadoes. “A huge one is resource constraints,” she tells Vox. “You have to have lodging wherever you&#8217;re going. You may need to have social support, potentially, if you want to stay with family and friends who are outside of the area. You have to have the ability to leave your job.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even in ordinary times, hotel and flight prices can be tough to stomach. Average hotel prices in the US have <a href="https://lodgingmagazine.com/j-d-power-2024-nagsi-study-shows-travelers-are-paying-more-for-hotel-rooms/">risen this year</a>; across the country, it has become increasingly common to pay <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/average-hotel-room-prices-data-a0afa164">upward of $200 per night</a> for a room. The cost of buying a car, maintaining it, and having insurance for it has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/your-money/car-ownership-costs-increase.html">gone up precipitously</a> in the past few years. Then there are the <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/23641875/food-grocery-inflation-prices-billionaires">higher food prices</a> to consider. If you’ve evacuated to temporary lodgings and don’t have a stove, eating out can quickly become costly. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over a quarter of Americans had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/americans-checking-account-balance/">less than $500</a> in their checking account last year, according to a CNBC Select survey, and over half of Americans have less than $1,000 saved for emergencies. A <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/hurricane-irmas-coming-what-an-average-family-spends-and-does-to-prepare">Fox Business report from 2017</a> estimated that hurricane preparation and evacuation could cost an average family as much as $5,000; a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/18/multimedia/hurricane-florence-motel-evacuees.html">New York Times report</a> from 2018, when Hurricane Florence ravaged North Carolina, cites one family having to cough up over $2,000 to evacuate. It can be prohibitively expensive to survive a storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some, the risk of lost wages or other <a href="https://x.com/HorrorGorl/status/1843684304385143005">consequences</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@officialladdyyg/video/7423010068448382254?_r=1&amp;_t=8qPCtDRp5ac">of missing</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/McDonaldsEmployees/comments/1fyyp5z/usa_what_to_do_because_were_being_forced_to_work/">work</a> may have influenced their <a href="https://slate.com/business/2022/09/hurricane-ian-workers-rights-laws.html">decision to stay put</a>. During Hurricane Helene, a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/05/us/tennessee-impact-plastics-factory-helene/index.html">factory called Impact Plastics</a> in Erwin, Tennessee, allegedly told employees to continue working despite flood warnings in the area. The company denies that it discouraged employees from leaving, saying in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_DzP__-9kg">video statement</a> last week that they had been told to leave “at least 45 minutes before the gigantic force of the flood hit the industrial park.” It’s currently being investigated after 11 workers went missing, at least <a href="https://www.wcyb.com/news/local/bodies-of-5-of-6-impact-plastics-employees-swept-away-by-flood-recovered">five</a> of whom have since been found dead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How the government — and some companies — are trying to help</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To ease some of the costs of evacuation, the state of Florida has <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/07/governor-ron-desantis-suspends-tolls-to-assist-hurricane-milton-evacuations/">suspended road tolls</a> and has encouraged hotels to <a href="https://frla.org/news-release/frla-works-with-state-of-florida-to-encourage-reduced-costs-at-hotels-for-milton-evacuees/">waive pet fees</a>. Uber, which famously came under fire for <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/08/uber-reaches-agreement-with-n-y-on-surge-pricing-during-emergencies/">surge pricing</a> in New York during Hurricane Sandy, is giving people fleeing Milton <a href="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-floridia-free-uber-rides-shelters/75567254007/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.heraldtribune.com/story/weather/hurricane/2024/10/08/hurricane-milton-floridia-free-uber-rides-shelters/75567254007/">free rides to shelters.</a> Major US airlines, including <a href="https://www.united.com/en/us/fly/travel/trip-planning/travel-alerts.html">United</a>, <a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/travel-alerts.jsp">American</a>, and Delta are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/travel/hurricane-helene-disrupting-travel-fliers-need-know-rcna173505">waiving some fees</a> if you need to rebook a flight. A few hotels have also been offering “distress rates” for evacuees, with <a href="https://www.wmbfnews.com/2024/10/08/myrtle-beach-resorts-offer-discount-those-evacuating-hurricane-milton/">one Myrtle Beach resort</a> charging as little as $39 per night before taxes, and rooms at an <a href="https://www.wftv.com/news/local/rosen-hotels-resorts-reduces-pricing-hurricane-milton/WEDJTZ47IFE6JP6XNOI2VBMRKE/">Orlando area hotel chain</a> starting at $69 before taxes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The supply-and-demand explanation for why things like flights and hotels can cost more during emergencies is that a lot of people are trying to snap them up at the last minute. That doesn’t mean it’s in a company’s best interest to hike prices, especially when people have been airing their sticker shock online. In some cases, it could even be illegal price gouging.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Price gouging is different than a normal market increasing prices,” says Teresa Murray, director of the Consumer Watchdog office at the Public Interest Research Groups. It usually needs to occur during some kind of emergency, and only applies to essential goods. One clear example of price gouging, according to Murray, happened during the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/5/12/23068472/baby-formula-shortage-2022-why">baby formula shortage</a> in 2022.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/how-to-report-price-gouging-after-a-natural-disaster/">37 states</a> have some sort of anti-price gouging law in the books. Florida’s anti-price gouging law doesn’t kick in unless an official state of emergency has been declared, which Gov. Ron DeSantis did <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/05/emorandum-executive-order-number-24-214-emergency-management-tropical-storm-milton/">this past</a> <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/10/05/emorandum-executive-order-number-24-214-emergency-management-tropical-storm-milton/">weekend</a>. If the price of food, water, or gas, for example, “grossly exceeds” the average prices seen in the 30 days before the state of emergency, that’s illegal — but it’s not clear what “grossly exceeds” exactly means. <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/consumers/pricegougingduringdisasters#2C">Some states</a> set a price increase threshold, such as anything more than 10 percent above normal prices. The Florida attorney general’s office has urged residents to <a href="https://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrelease/attorney-general-moody-extends-price-gouging-hotline-following-declared-state-emergency">report any price gouging</a> they see; it was already <a href="https://www.wfla.com/news/politics/florida-attorney-generals-team-investigates-price-gouging-amid-hurricane-season/">investigating potential price gouging</a> after receiving hundreds of complaints during Hurricane Helene. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg <a href="https://x.com/SecretaryPete/status/1843464151324389620">said on X</a> that the Department of Transportation is “keeping a close eye on flights in and out of areas affected by Hurricane Milton” to ensure there’s no price gouging, and the department is now <a href="https://x.com/petemuntean/status/1843740317494964379">in touch with airlines</a> about the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Typically, Murray adds, we see a lot of <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/after-a-hurricane-or-tropical-storm-watch-out-for-repair-scams-price-gouging-unsafe-generator-use/">price gouging</a> — whether it’s water, food, or supplies needed for clean-up and repair, like chainsaws — happening in the aftermath of a disaster. With Milton, too, we might see more of it occurring as recovery efforts begin. “It’s just unconscionable that some companies might be taking advantage of this crisis by jacking up their prices,” Murray says. “We&#8217;re talking about people&#8217;s lives here.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">AI companies are on a mission to radically change our world. They’re working on building machines that could outstrip human intelligence and unleash a dramatic economic transformation on us all.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sam Altman, the CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has basically told us he’s trying to build a god — or <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/dd9ba2f6-f509-42f0-8e97-4271c7b84ded">“magic intelligence in the sky,”</a> as he puts it. OpenAI’s official term for this is artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Altman says that AGI will not only <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/02/03/exclusive-openai-sam-altman-chatgpt-agi-google-search/">“break capitalism”</a> but also that it’s <a href="https://blog.samaltman.com/machine-intelligence-part-1">“probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity.”</a> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a very natural question here: Did anyone actually ask for this kind of AI? By what right do a few powerful tech CEOs get to decide that our whole world should be turned upside down?&nbsp;   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll">As I’ve written before</a>, it’s clearly undemocratic that private companies are building tech that aims to totally change the world without seeking buy-in from the public. In fact, even leaders at the major companies are expressing unease about how undemocratic it is.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jack Clark, the co-founder of the AI company Anthropic, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23794855/anthropic-ai-openai-claude-2">told Vox</a> last year that it’s “a real weird thing that this is not a government project.” He also <a href="https://importai.substack.com/p/import-ai-337-why-i-am-confused-about">wrote</a> that there are several key things he’s “confused and uneasy” about, including, “How much permission do AI developers need to get from society before irrevocably changing society?” Clark continued:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">Technologists have always had something of a libertarian streak, and this is perhaps best epitomized by the ‘social media’ and Uber et al era of the 2010s — vast, society-altering systems ranging from social networks to rideshare systems were deployed into the world and aggressively scaled with little regard to the societies they were influencing. This form of permissionless invention is basically the implicitly preferred form of development as epitomized by Silicon Valley and the general ‘move fast and break things’ philosophy of tech. Should the same be true of AI?</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I’ve noticed that when anyone questions that norm of “permissionless invention,” a lot of tech enthusiasts push back. Their objections always seem to fall into one of three categories. Because this is such a perennial and important debate, it’s worth tackling each of them in turn — and why I think they’re wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Objection 1: “Our use is our consent”&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">ChatGPT is the fastest-growing consumer application in history: It had <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">100 million active users</a> just two months after it launched. There’s no disputing that lots of people genuinely found it really cool. And it spurred the release of other chatbots, like Claude, which all sorts of people are getting use out of — from journalists to coders to busy parents who want someone (or something) else to make the goddamn grocery list.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some claim that this simple fact&nbsp;—&nbsp;we’re using the AI! — proves that people consent to what the major companies are doing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a common claim, but I think it’s very misleading. Our use of an AI system is not tantamount to consent. By “consent” we typically mean informed consent, not consent born of ignorance or coercion. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of the public is not informed about the true costs and benefits of these systems. How many people are aware, for instance, that generative AI sucks up so much energy that <a href="https://time.com/6987773/ai-data-centers-energy-usage-climate-change/">companies like Google and Microsoft are reneging on their climate pledges as a result</a>? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plus, we all live in choice environments that coerce us into using technologies we’d rather avoid. Sometimes we “consent” to tech&nbsp;because we fear we’ll be at a professional disadvantage if we don’t use it. Think about social media. I would personally not be on X (formerly known as Twitter) if not for the fact that it’s seen as important for my job as a journalist. In a recent <a href="https://theharrispoll.com/briefs/gen-z-social-media-smart-phones/">survey</a>, many young people said they wish social media platforms were never invented, but given that these platforms do exist, they feel pressure to be on them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even if you think someone’s use of a particular AI system does constitute consent, that doesn’t mean they consent to the bigger project of building AGI.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This brings us to an important distinction: There’s narrow AI — a system that’s purpose-built for a specific task (say, language translation) — and then there’s AGI. Narrow AI can be fantastic!<strong> </strong>It’s helpful that AI systems can perform a crude copy edit of your work for free or let you write computer code using just plain English. It’s awesome that AI is helping scientists better understand disease.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And it’s extremely awesome that <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22045713/ai-artificial-intelligence-deepmind-protein-folding">AI cracked the protein-folding problem</a> — the challenge of predicting which 3D shape a protein will fold into — a puzzle that stumped biologists for 50 years. The Nobel Committee for Chemistry clearly agrees: It just gave a Nobel prize to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03214-7?utm_source=Live+Audience&amp;utm_campaign=3ea6e2da1a-nature-briefing-daily-20241009&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_b27a691814-3ea6e2da1a-50070192">AI pioneers</a> for enabling this breakthrough, which will help with drug discovery.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that is different from the attempt to build a general-purpose reasoning machine that outstrips humans, a “magic intelligence in the sky.” While plenty of people do want narrow AI, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll">polling shows that most Americans do not want AGI</a>. Which brings us to …</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Objection 2: “The public is too ignorant to tell innovators how to innovate”</strong> </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here’s a quote commonly (though <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/28/ford-faster-horse/">dubiously</a>) attributed to car-maker Henry Ford: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The claim here is that there’s a good reason why genius inventors don’t ask for the public’s buy-in before releasing a new invention: Society is too ignorant or unimaginative to know what good innovation looks like. From the printing press and the telegraph to electricity and the internet, many of the great technological innovations in history happened because a few individuals decided on them by fiat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that doesn’t mean deciding by fiat is always appropriate. The fact that society has often let inventors do that may be partly because of technological solutionism, partly because of a belief in the “great man” view of history, and partly because, well, it would have been pretty hard to consult broad swaths of society in an era before mass communications — before things like a printing press or a telegraph!&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And while those inventions did come with <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-victorians-had-the-same-concerns-about-technology-as-we-do-60476">perceived risks</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/23178764/florida-us19-deadliest-pedestrian-fatality-crisis">real</a> harms, they didn’t pose the threat of wiping out humanity altogether or making us subservient to a different species.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the few technologies we’ve invented so far that meet that bar, seeking democratic input and establishing mechanisms for global oversight <em>have</em> been attempted, and rightly so. It’s the reason we have a Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and a Biological Weapons Convention — <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/23510633/arms-control-bioweapons-convention-nukes-ukraine-putin">treaties that, though it’s a struggle to implement them effectively, matter a lot</a> for keeping our world safe.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s true, of course, that most people don’t understand the nitty-gritty of AI. So,<strong> </strong>the argument here is not that the public should be dictating the minutiae of AI policy. It’s that it’s wrong to ignore the public’s general wishes when it comes to questions like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/364384/its-practically-impossible-to-run-a-big-ai-company-ethically">“Should the government enforce safety standards before a catastrophe occurs or only punish companies after the fact?”</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/19/18412674/ai-bias-facial-recognition-black-gay-transgender">“Are there certain kinds of AI that shouldn’t exist at all?”</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Daniel Colson, the executive director of the nonprofit AI Policy Institute, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll">told me</a> last year, “Policymakers shouldn’t take the specifics of how to solve these problems from voters or the contents of polls. The place where I think voters <em>are</em> the right people to ask, though, is: What do you want out of policy? And what direction do you want society to go in?”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Objection 3: “It’s impossible to curtail innovation anyway”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, there’s the technological inevitability argument, which says that you can’t halt the march of technological progress —&nbsp;it’s unstoppable!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/10/1/20887003/tech-technology-evolution-natural-inevitable-ethics">a myth</a>. In fact, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23621198/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-china-ai-safety-technology">there are lots of technologies that we’ve decided not to build</a>, or that we’ve built but placed very tight restrictions on. Just think of human cloning or human germline modification. The recombinant DNA researchers behind the Asilomar Conference of 1975 famously organized a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/455290a">moratorium</a> on certain experiments. We are, notably, still not cloning humans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or think of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty. Adopted by the United Nations against the backdrop of the Cold War, it barred nations from doing certain things in space —&nbsp;like storing their nuclear weapons there. Nowadays, the treaty comes up in <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/21/18224984/arecibo-message-aliens-kids-contest-seti-meti-extraterrestrial">debates about whether we should send messages into space</a> with the hope of reaching extraterrestrials. Some argue that’s dangerous because an alien species, once aware of us, might conquer and oppress us. Others argue it’ll be great — maybe the aliens will gift us their knowledge in the form of an Encyclopedia Galactica! </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Either way, it’s clear that the stakes are incredibly high and all of human civilization would be affected, prompting some to <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/6/20680228/aliens-survey-seti-meti-scientists-extraterrestrial-message">make the case for democratic deliberation</a> before intentional transmissions are sent into space.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the old Roman proverb goes: What touches all should be decided by all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That is as true of superintelligent AI as it is of nukes, chemical weapons, or interstellar broadcasts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s an old saying that “writing about music is like dancing about architecture.” It’s intended as a dig at music criticism, but beneath that, there’s a deeper truth: Music is intangible, subjective; it’s universal yet still deeply personal. And while science and math are involved in its creation, there is something undeniably mystical about it. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Laraaji is a 80-year-old pioneer of so-called New Age music and someone who’s been sitting on the fringes of the music world for decades — though, last year, he joined Andre 3000 onstage in Brooklyn. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When he was young, Laraaji experimented with acting, including a role in the landmark experimental film <em>Putney Swope</em>, and spent time in the 1960s standup comedy scene. After that, he became interested in spiritual communities, discovered the autoharp, and devoted his life to making music. He’s been a truly prolific artist ever since.<br><br>I recently invited Laraaji on <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> to talk about music, meditation, spirituality, and the therapeutic power of laughter. As always, there’s <em>much</em> more in the full podcast, so listen and follow <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-gray-area"><em>The Gray Area</em></a> on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/id1081584611">Apple Podcasts</a>,<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/6NOJ6IkTb2GWMj1RpmtnxP"> Spotify</a>,<a href="https://www.pandora.com/podcast/the-gray-area-with-sean-illing/PC:30793?source=stitcher-sunset"> Pandora</a>, or wherever you find podcasts.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m so intrigued by all the artistic interests you&#8217;ve had in your life. You&#8217;ve done standup comedy. You&#8217;ve done acting. Obviously, in the end, you gave yourself over to music. Did the experience of acting and doing comedy make you a better musician? Or is it just creatively a totally different thing? </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s the same thing, Sean. It&#8217;s wherever I choose to open and give expression to. I&#8217;m practicing the art of surrendering and spontaneity.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I think that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m a lousy musician. I&#8217;m too in my own damn head.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I say observe your body language when you have your next orgasm.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I don&#8217;t think anybody — including myself — wants to see that!</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Seriously, look at your breath. Look at your body language. Look how focused you are into surrendering to this energetic expression. And I see some of that expression carried over into the way people sing pop music, rock music. They get into the more orgasmic, passionate level of release.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you think of yourself as primarily an improvisational musician for those reasons?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I depend more on improvisation than I do on set scores. I find that improvisation is aligned with what I call my spiritual belief that every moment is new. And to trust that what I need in this moment is here.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Musicians always talk about that, feeling more like a conduit than an author. Is that what it&#8217;s like for you on stage?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, and it&#8217;s magical and mystical and a transportive place because you&#8217;re somehow beyond linear time flow. You&#8217;re in the midst of local time, but you&#8217;re also witnessing an unbroken, constant present time. It&#8217;s speaking through me and it&#8217;s speaking as me. I&#8217;m sound, I&#8217;m space, I&#8217;m timelessness. This is like music I can dream up. Part of my art is knowing when to get out of the way, how to set up a musical flow or a musical event, and then to step to the side of it and let it speak through.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You also sing but it feels like part of the music, like there&#8217;s little distinction between the instruments you&#8217;re playing and what&#8217;s coming from your voice. Do you think of your voice as another instrument and not something separate?</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes, I do like doing everything at the same time. Spontaneous, unified flow.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Create a flow with several instruments at the same time, using the voice without calling the mental process into linear thinking. And using a voice as an emotional expressional instrument. That&#8217;s what I’ve been exploring, especially with meditation or deep contemplation of contacting altered planes of conscious present time. And so to talk about it is to take the mind out of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there&#8217;s sounds of passion, passionate immersion. The voice can be used to express witnessing inside of an awe-inspiring perception. So the whole body becomes the voice and the breath and the movement and become a conduit. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Invented or improvisational language can be the evidence of a person or practitioner in total immersion, total submission, getting involved with a total perception that&#8217;s beyond linear description. So the brain is given a vacation, and in that vacation or place, it might be freed up to have an alternative space-time experience. And that might be the message the artist wants to convey, that there is an alternative way of being conscious here and now.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I have heard you talk about music as a tool for total presence. Why do you think music has that kind of effect on us?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Music generated or channeled by the right musician or artist? The artist is in a state of contemplation or meditation or a suspended time awareness. And in the languaging that occurs with their instrument, their interaction with their instrument and with their voice can convey this repurposing of the human instrument, repurposing it from a conveyor of local human-based emotion to a conduit of exalted emotion, direct perception inside this timeless present moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It&#8217;s always available. Certain sounds. Drones can do that. Music that&#8217;s very spontaneous, that can pull the mind out of linear thought, could allow the perceiver, the listener, to suddenly directly notice the reality of eternal time and the infinite space.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sound can point to the invisible and sound can suggest the flowing of energy, the flowing of blood, the flowing of breath. It can suggest the integration of seemingly separate and discordant. In the case of a harp, all 36 strings are vibrating at the same time and producing this synergetic tonal event. So, as you say, that sound can throw a suggestion. It can point to the invisible, it can point to the transcendent. It can direct the emotional body out of heaviness so that a lightness, a more ethereal resonance can be directly witnessed.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Once we start talking and using words, we&#8217;re already in the world of ideas and abstractions. But music is more primary than that, right? It touches something in us that existed before we invented words.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes. Music might be able to say more than what speech can say. My general mode of operation is to prepare before a performance or recording through just dropping into a refined sense of the meditative field. Do some yoga postures, some breathing exercises, some positive affirmations, and then sculpt this field or point to this transcendental field and let it transmit itself into a sound repetition through me. When this happens, I tend to call it a sound bath. A celestial sound bath. It’s an immersion experience. And once again, here we&#8217;re away from the words and we&#8217;re into the pure impacting force of sound.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Do you actually find a meaningful distinction between music and meditation, or is it all just different manifestations of the same practice?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">My ultimate answer is that they&#8217;re one and the same, meaning that in the moment of deepest meditation, I consider meditation to be the highest romance and that romance is the highest meditation. This meditation is simultaneous with music. It couldn&#8217;t be separated.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When did laughter become such an important thing for you?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It shifted the energies of the bullies in my neighborhood when I was young to use humor. I wouldn&#8217;t be so afraid of their presence when I could use humor. And in church, we use humor because it could get so boring. And because I was in the right place to use it, we&#8217;d use it to get other peers to laugh in the middle of a serious sermon. But I notice the power of laughter to alter, to break the sense of rigidity and separation. I began writing scripts in high school and doing situation comedies for talent shows because I enjoyed seeing people lose it to laughter. The family I grew up in, the uncles, aunts, the cousins all were laughter friendly, so laughter was always on the menu. I can&#8217;t remember even a funeral where laughter was outlawed.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You really do see it as a transformative force?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, after doing standup comedy I decided to let standup comedy go for a while and just focus on music. It was a book by Rajneesh, Osho Rajneesh, that helped me to realize that I could access the laughter experience without doing comedy, and that I could guide other people into the laughter zone and enjoy the deliciousness of laughter without using humor and at the sacrifice of something. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And now, through laughter — play shops, I call them — we use laughter to get people into the play zone and to get them into contact with their inner child and to get them into deep relaxation. Yeah. And I really enjoy laughter now because it can come up out of people without it having to be nervous. Yeah, the entire body can get involved. The entire breath can be open, and it&#8217;s getting sweeter and more delicious every time I do one of these. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So laughter is another way to transcend the thinking mind?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yes. Rajneesh pointed out that when you&#8217;re laughing, really involved with laughter, that you or us or whoever is laughing is not thinking, they&#8217;re not involved in the thought process of linear thought. That may be so if you&#8217;re into pure, open laughter. If it&#8217;s a nervous laughter where you&#8217;re mindful of a threatening situation, that would be a different situation. But real, full body, cathartic laughter, you&#8217;re releasing faster than you can think. So there&#8217;s no thought process processing what it is that&#8217;s being released. It’s just a yummy, open, nurturing release. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You&#8217;ve been a professional musician for decades, performing all over the world. You&#8217;re entangled with the business and the commercial side of music. I guess I just wonder how you navigate that element, of being a professional musician and being a spiritual person at the same time?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Well, I did many years ago get that unless I integrate my spiritual nature, I would never be totally happy, content, or experience resolution because I can&#8217;t get it from the physical world. I&#8217;m not hating the physical world, but things in the physical world are temporary and constantly we&#8217;re reminded that things come, they stay, and then they leave. And some things are just too beautiful for us to accept that they&#8217;re ever going to leave. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And I grew to understand that behind the world that is changing, there is this spiritual field that if I learn how to embrace it constantly, even while I&#8217;m embracing my outer wealth, that when the outer wealth shifts, I&#8217;m not bent out of shape because I&#8217;m still connected to this inner spiritual platform that doesn&#8217;t get bent out of shape when the outer world shifts. So for me, staying constant and staying with my spiritual practice allows me to be more playful and less fearful of the physical world, and less fearful of change and less fearful of losing. And so I find that the spiritual side helps me to be more present, more experimental, and more risk-taking with my musical expression.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;ve also heard you say that you think our core spiritual problem is our misidentification with our bodies. What does that mean?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;m not going to do this. I wouldn&#8217;t think of doing this to you, Sean. </p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wait, what are you going to do to me?!&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I would amputate your leg. Your feet. You&#8217;re still there. Your torso. You&#8217;re still there. Your arms, your elbows. You&#8217;re still there. That&#8217;s just a head. And you&#8217;re still there. Your ears and nose goes. You&#8217;re still there. Your lips and tongue. God is still there. Suddenly your head disappears. But you&#8217;re still there. And you&#8217;re saying to yourself, wait a minute. I thought I was that body. Look. I&#8217;m timeless. I&#8217;m invisible. I&#8217;m wingless. What do I do with this? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And I believe that identification with the physical body, which is birth, that lives and dies, and we get attached to it, and we get sentimental with it. And we try to enjoy its five senses, and we forget, or we don&#8217;t access the joy that we can have, the more expansive joy we can have through the infinite self that is always here.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Perhaps your buddies have had an epiphany through the use of certain ceremonies. Where you&#8217;re suddenly in another sense of present time and space, a different sense of expansiveness, a different sense of how time is unfolding, slower or not at all. And to have this experience is to be taking advantage of a different form of body. The deepest sense of happiness and joy I feel comes from having an intimate, communing experience with my eternal present time-self. The spiritual presence which is always here, always everywhere. It just needs to be totally present, to dig it in, to catch it and to wear it and to behold it.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Sean Illing&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You&#8217;re 80 years old. You&#8217;ve been making music for over 40 years. You&#8217;ve lived such an interesting life as an artist and a contemplative. As you sit here now, today, what is your spiritual mission? What gets you out of bed every day?&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Laraaji&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I&#8217;ll go through what I have to do the moment I get out of bed. Usually what gets me up is a sense of a daily agenda, which is different every day. Something that I&#8217;m going to do that day that I&#8217;m going to really enjoy, whether it&#8217;s music, performance, or designing, new tuning or getting to know a new piece of equipment, or sitting for an extra period of time in meditation, either in lotus position in my house or going for a walk in Central Park or Riverside Park and sitting on a bench in the sun, getting into meditation. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What keeps me enthusiastically involved in life and passionately involved with life is the sensation of an eternal non-human intelligence that&#8217;s generating this thing called creation and is allowing me to participate in it and to co-witness and to co-collaborate with it. And then in the midst of this, it is remaining invisible and remaining infinite. And I&#8217;m feeling it through my connection with it. And so it&#8217;s not so much what I&#8217;m getting out of bed for, but as I&#8217;m getting out of bed there’s this sense of conscious improvisational collaboration within the divine alternating intelligence. But when I&#8217;m doing tours and I&#8217;m put in a nice, beautiful hotel, I&#8217;ll happily get out of bed for the breakfast.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Run by a subsidiary of the poultry giant Perdue, which raises hundreds of thousands of chickens on factory farms across Sonoma, the slaughter plant typifies the unusual politics of agriculture in this part of the country, where a cultivated image of gentle, humane farming sometimes sits uneasily alongside an increasingly consolidated agriculture sector. The county has also seen a recent influx of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/09/animal-rights-california-sonoma-farms-00162034">new residents</a> fleeing rising housing prices in San Francisco, a longtime center of animal rights activism and utopian thought.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The region’s rural heritage and progressive politics will collide next month when Sonoma County residents vote on a first-of-its-kind ballot measure that could banish Perdue’s chicken facilities, along with all other large factory farms. The <a href="https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/measure-text" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/measure-text">proposed law</a> — which would cap the size of animal agriculture facilities and phase out all large factory farms in the county within three years — faces long odds. If successful, it could reshape the face of farming in the county and set a precedent that has terrified agricultural interests in California and across the country.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Known as <a href="https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/">Measure J</a>, the proposal has produced fierce debate in the county over the environmental, public health, and animal welfare impacts of modern animal agriculture. It’s <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/sonoma-county-measure-j-factory-farming-campaign-contributions/">poised</a> to generate the highest campaign spending of any ballot measure in Sonoma County history, with about $2 million in contributions made for and against — the vast majority of which has been spent by industry in <a href="https://www.noonmeasurej.com/">opposition</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Measure J is one of a pair of local ballot initiatives this fall seeking to abolish industrial animal agriculture. In Denver, a historic center for the Western livestock trade and still an important hub for the US sheep industry, voters will decide next month whether to <a href="https://proanimal.org/campaigns/denver-slaughterhouse-ban/">ban slaughterhouses</a> in the city. The measure’s passage would shut down a lamb slaughter plant that butchers <a href="https://csuredi.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/REDI-Research-May-24-Denver-Slaughterhouse.pdf">up to 500,000</a> lambs per year, accounting for between 15 and 20 percent of all US lamb meat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both measures face opposition from their respective political elites, including the local Democratic Parties in Denver and Sonoma and the entire Sonoma County Board of Supervisors. While some prior farm animal welfare ballot measures — like California’s historic 2018 animal welfare law, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23721488/prop-12-scotus-pork-pigs-factory-farming-california-bacon">Proposition 12</a> — have been more limited in scope, aiming to incrementally improve horrific factory farm conditions, the Sonoma County and Denver measures are more clearly perceived as bans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The measures are easily perceived as negative, as snatching things away from people — and they put proponents in the awkward position of trying to persuade voters to effectively abolish an industry, at least locally, on which they depend for abundant cheap meat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s already famously expensive to live in California in part because it’s <a href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-144156645">difficult</a> to build housing, and some Sonoma residents may roll their eyes at Measure J as yet another bid to make it <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/californias-business-cost-remains-expensive-new-study-says/">prohibitively expensive</a> to do business in the Golden State.&nbsp;But industrial animal agriculture —&nbsp;a sector that exacts <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">immense costs</a> on the public in the form of greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, strain on local resources, disease risk, and animal suffering — makes a more worthy target for a ban.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In principle, there’s a lot of sense in capping the size of factory farms. Measure J&#8217;s proponents are betting that progressive Sonoma County, better known for its tasting rooms than its slaughterhouses, can push California — and the nation — in that direction.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Animal cruelty in a farming paradise</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Measure J, advanced by a <a href="https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/">coalition</a> of animal rights, environmental, and public health groups known as the Coalition to End Factory Farming, would require farms <a href="https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sector_table.pdf">classified by the US Environmental Protection Agency</a> as large “concentrated animal feeding operations” (known as CAFOs) to either downsize or shut down within three years. The proposal is similar to a farm reform <a href="https://www.booker.senate.gov/news/press/booker-reintroduces-bill-to-reform-farm-system-with-expanded-support-from-farm-labor-environment-public-health-faith-based-and-animal-welfare-groups">bill</a> introduced by Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) that would phase out large CAFOs by 2040.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sonoma doesn’t have the <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">mega factory farms</a> found in the Midwest or South, or elsewhere in California, that pack together millions of chickens or several thousand cows in one place. But it does have big industrial farms that employ standard factory farm methods.&nbsp;</p>

For dairy farms, the cap is 700 mature dairy cows; for duck farms, 30,000 ducks; for egg-laying hens, 82,000, and for chickens raised for meat, 125,000." data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Weber Family Farms, one of the county’s top egg producers, was <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/latest-sonoma-county-front-in-avian-flu-crisis-how-exposed-farm-raised-bir/">hit</a> last year with a bird flu infection and killed its flock using <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23963820/bird-flu-surge-us-ventilation-shutdown-veterinarians">“ventilation shutdown plus”</a> — a highly controversial, painful method being used on many large farms to mass cull poultry birds by sealing up sheds and pumping in extreme heat, killing them via heatstroke.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Yes on J campaign has <a href="https://www.endfactoryfarming.vote/cafos#cafo-map">compiled</a> a list of 21 farms in Sonoma County that they believe meet the large CAFO threshold, including several egg farms and chicken meat farms, six dairies, and one duck farm. Dairy operations of 700 or more mature dairy cows are classified as large CAFOs, while chicken farms can house up to 125,000 birds before being considered large CAFOs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The trend is toward mergers and toward ever-increasing sizes in animal agriculture,” Woody Hastings, a Sonoma County resident who works in climate policy and supports Measure J, told me. Hastings has worked with environmental justice organizations in California’s Central Valley, a far more CAFO-dense, ultra-productive agricultural region where residents <a href="https://nature.berkeley.edu/classes/es196/projects/2022final/SallstromE_2022.pdf">are afflicted by</a> air and water pollution and terrible odors. “What I learned in my work in the Central Valley is seeing how bad things can get if there is no cap on the size,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal farming industries have <a href="https://sonomaunitedvote.org/">mobilized</a> an all-out war against Measure J, pushing social media campaigns, TV ads, and a direct mail blitz, at times making exaggerated claims about the measure’s potential to wipe out all animal agriculture in the county or cause a <a href="https://www.noonmeasurej.com/faq">dramatic spike</a> in food prices.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One direct mailer sponsored by Western United Dairies (WUD), a dairy trade group, claimed the measure would shut down “more than 60 organic dairy farms” — but there are only 50 dairy farms of all categories in the county, according to the most recent USDA <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2022/Full_Report/Volume_1,_Chapter_2_County_Level/California/st06_2_011_011.pdf">data</a>, and most of them don’t meet the threshold to be affected by Measure J. “We do not differentiate between any dairy farming operations,” WUD told me in a statement, adding that they were concerned that Measure J would affect all dairy farms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The measure is written in a confusing way, and there’s been uncertainty&nbsp;in the county about&nbsp;its scope,&nbsp;with some arguing that it could be construed to include farms that are smaller than large CAFOs.&nbsp;The measure says that it would phase out both medium and large CAFOs, but because the definition of a medium CAFO requires that it directly discharge manure into surface water, no&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/chicken-farms-dairy-factory-animal-activists-farmers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known farm</a>&nbsp;in the county, based on EPA data, meets the EPA&#8217;s standard to be a medium CAFO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of the opposition to Measure J has centered on Sonoma County’s dairy industry, which has been declining in recent decades and has almost entirely <a href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/business/north-bay-dairies-shift-to-organic-milk-production-seeking-higher-income-a/">converted</a> to organic, pasture-based operations because they command higher retail prices, according to Daniel Sumner, an agricultural economist at UC Davis. Although the measure wouldn’t affect consumer prices much because grocery stores would simply stock more milk from elsewhere in the region, Sumner said, it is<em> </em>likely to reduce significantly how much milk is produced in Sonoma.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s left some Sonoma voters asking: Why punish dairies that are doing things better than the vast majority of the US dairy industry? Measure J “threatens what is probably one of the best progressive dairy environments, certainly in California, probably in the country,” Roy Smith, a small farmer in Sonoma County, told me.&nbsp;“Yes, there are compromises that are made, but if we wanted to improve the well-being [of animals], I would suggest that more dairies reopen here, and close the ones that are low-welfare in Wisconsin.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No dairy farm in Sonoma is as big as America’s biggest <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">mega-dairies</a>, and it’s undoubtedly true that cows with access to a pasture have it better than those raised on conventional factory farms. But organic dairies can still qualify as <a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/organic-concentrated-animal-feeding-operations-dairy-usda-factory-farms">CAFOs</a>. Most of Sonoma’s milk cows are still concentrated on farms that are very large, and large-scale dairy production of any kind is hard to justify on environmental and animal welfare grounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether they’re raised organic or conventional, ruminant grazing requires a lot of land and water — the latter increasingly scarce in the <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23655640/colorado-river-water-alfalfa-dairy-beef-meat">parched American West</a> — and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf">produces significant greenhouse gas emissions</a>. Organic dairy CAFOs, including some in Sonoma, share some of the characteristics of conventional ones, like the use of manure lagoons — giant pools of animal waste that pollute air and water and can harm human health. And, organic or not, the dairy business model depends on repeatedly impregnating dairy cows and taking away their newborns (highly social animals that are then generally forced to live alone in small hutches) to extract the cows’ milk, keeping them alive just as long as they remain productive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A recent Atlantic <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/04/alexandre-farms-treatment-of-animals/677980/">investigation</a> into one of the nation’s most celebrated organic dairies, a few counties north of Sonoma, found pervasive animal cruelty, including some techniques that were unique to the organic model. (Because milk from cows that have ever received antibiotics can’t be marketed as organic, cows can be denied them even when they really need them for a painful disease or injury.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In my experience writing about the livestock industry, it’s often the worst factory farms that set the bar for how we talk about animal agriculture, allowing other producers — including organic facilities — to appear idyllic by comparison. We rarely frame the conversation around what animals truly deserve: Does it really make sense to mass produce another mammal for its milk, separating mothers from babies, all for a product that <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/352359/milk-dairy-schools">isn’t nutritionally necessary</a> and that climate scientists <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf">say</a> is so high in emissions that we have to scale it down?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Measure J, a blunt instrument for shrinking a bloated industry, offers one possible answer: We have to make less of it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Slaughterhouse zero</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Denver, meanwhile, the proposed slaughterhouse ban, led by the advocacy group <a href="https://proanimal.org/">Pro-Animal Future</a>, looms like a “black cloud” over the US sheep industry, as one sheep feedlot employee <a href="https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/21538-lamb-processors-fate-in-question-as-denver-voters-weigh-slaughterhouse-ban">put it</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last 50 years, American lamb farming has <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat?country=~USA">declined precipitously</a>; the Denver slaughterhouse that would be shut down by the ballot measure, run by top lamb producer Superior Farms, is one of relatively few important facilities remaining.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the measure passes, it&#8217;s possible that some producers will be able to send their animals to be slaughtered elsewhere or that a new slaughterhouse will open outside Denver limits. Or, Sumner told me, the measure could hasten the death of the lamb industry altogether. Not many investors are saying, “Gee, I think I&#8217;ll go into the lamb slaughtering business,” he said. “Mostly they look for something that’s growing, and nobody thinks the lamb business is growing.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pro-Animal Future, much like the coalition campaigning for Measure J in Sonoma County, sees the ballot initiative as a means to start civic conversations about building a more humane, planet-friendly food system, without making people feel like the only option available to them for making change is to go vegan.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The lamb industry, particularly an industrial slaughterhouse, is a reasonable target for such a reckoning: Most people rarely eat lamb — making them perhaps more sympathetic to them as animals — while slaughterhouses are, pretty much invariably, sites of terrible violence. The per-serving climate impact of sheep’s meat is also <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/ghg-per-protein-poore">significant</a>, second only to beef.&nbsp;The Superior slaughterhouse, under the name Mountain Meadows, was also recently <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-settlement-superior-farms-resolves-chemical-risk-violations-north-denver-facility">fined</a> by the EPA for Clean Air Act violations, and has been <a href="https://violationtracker.goodjobsfirst.org/?company=Mountain+meadows+lamb">fined</a> multiple times for labor violations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This week, the Intercept <a href="https://theintercept.com/2024/10/09/lamb-slaughter-ban-superior-farms-denver-ordinance-309/" data-type="link" data-id="https://theintercept.com/2024/10/09/lamb-slaughter-ban-superior-farms-denver-ordinance-309/">published</a> findings from a recent <a href="https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/campaigns/denver-slaughterhouse-animal-cruelty-exposed-superior-farms-investigation-reveals-shocking-violence" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/campaigns/denver-slaughterhouse-animal-cruelty-exposed-superior-farms-investigation-reveals-shocking-violence">undercover investigation</a> into conditions at the Superior slaughterhouse, including gruesome footage of partially eviscerated, thrashing lambs hanging upside down on the slaughter line, with one lamb appearing to lift its head and open its mouth, and injured lambs who are unable to walk being thrown, dragged, and kicked toward slaughter. It also documented what appears to be the use of <a href="https://ambrook.com/research/livestock/judas-goats-slaughter-meatpacking-wildlife-control">“Judas sheep”</a>: sheep who live at the slaughterhouse and have been trained to greet incoming truckloads of lambs and lead them to slaughter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Superior Farms spokesperson Bob Mariano told me in a statement that “nothing included in the footage we have seen is evidence of extreme violence, animal cruelty, or halal violations [the slaughterhouse is halal-certified]. This is yet another example of proponents of the slaughterhouse ban misunderstanding or misrepresenting standard, legally compliant parts of the slaughter process in an attempt to shock voters and influence an election. This is not the first time our workers have been attacked by activist groups falsely claiming that illegally obtained footage shows things that it simply does not.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The investigation’s findings echoed a recent Denver Post <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/10/06/denver-slaughterhouse-ban-ordinance-309/">op-ed</a> by Denver resident Jose Huizar, who worked at the slaughterhouse decades ago: “Someone has to wield that knife — over and over,” he wrote. “Spending your day slitting throats, stepping in guts, ripping the skin from the spasming bodies of animals who were alive moments ago — it’s hard to go home to your family after that.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The slaughterhouse, located in Denver’s low-income, majority nonwhite neighborhood of Globeville, <a href="https://www.denver7.com/news/local-news/november-ballot-measure-threatens-to-shut-down-denvers-only-slaughterhouse-160-jobs-on-the-line">employs</a> about 160 people — people who don’t want to lose their jobs. Like Measure J, the Denver ballot initiative directs local government to prioritize people whose jobs are eliminated as a result of the measure in workforce training programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Our hope is not just to stick it to this one slaughterhouse, but to draw a connection to the fact that this is how the industry is run generally,” Olivia Hammond, an organizer for Pro-Animal Future, told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Woody Hastings, the Sonoma resident, compared the fight against factory farming to oil and gas phase-outs: Just as we need to transition away from fossil fuels, we know we need to scale down industrial animal agriculture. We also know there will be economic impacts to such change that ought to be distributed fairly, and workers who lose their jobs ought to be treated with dignity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The anti-factory farming movement has a long way to go in convincing the people of Sonoma County and Denver to see industrial animal agriculture the way they do fossil fuels.&nbsp;And without meaningful change in either the underlying demand for meat and dairy, or in nationwide regulation of CAFOs, isolated local initiatives are, for now, likely to only shift production elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But should even one of the ballot measures succeed next month, political leaders might be persuaded that their constituents care enough about farm animal issues to create momentum for further reform. Win or lose, though, animal advocates will still face the wearying task of trying to bridge the public’s cognitive dissonance about where our meat comes from and channel it productively into politics.&nbsp;</p>

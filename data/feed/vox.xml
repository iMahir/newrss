<p class="has-text-align-none">The United Kingdom’s left-leaning Labour Party won —&nbsp;and won big —&nbsp;in the country’s national elections on Thursday, returning to power after 14 years of Conservative Party leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour made many promises in the party’s quest to win the race, and keeping them will be a gargantuan task that will require tackling Britain’s biggest issues including the cost of living, immigration, and rebuilding the country’s services like the health and transportation systems. A mixture of poor policy and world events outside the government’s control has left the UK’s&nbsp;economy struggling, translating to wage stagnation and lack of investment in state services.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The party’s exact approach to those issues is still coalescing as the party gets a sense of how it will wield its newfound power.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After a truly chaotic spin through three Conservative prime ministers in just under four months, Labour’s message of stability has resonated with the electorate as they voted in Labour members for a majority of the 650 House of Commons seats, making its leader, Keir Starmer, prime minister.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Starmer is a bit of a cypher, his platform this campaign has often been vague or unexciting, and the British public is decidedly <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/uk-general-election-keir-starmer-labour-party-prime-minister-sunak-rcna157473">lukewarm</a> on him as a figure. But he’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jul/03/general-election-labour-winning-keir-starmer-historic-victory-opposition-leader">successfully rehabilitated</a> the Labour Party’s image with more moderate voters, and, above all, what he has going for him is that he isn’t a Conservative.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[Conservatives are] suffering from having been in power for 14 years,” <a href="https://www.nuffield.ox.ac.uk/people/profiles/ben-ansell/">Ben Ansell</a>, professor of comparative democratic institutions at Nuffield College, Oxford, told Vox. “And it’s very, very hard at that point to win another election anywhere.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour’s campaign slogan is simple: “Change.” But now it won’t be enough to simply be the alternative to the Conservatives; Labour must actually deliver on the main policy issues people are concerned about in order to create the stable government it needs to stay in power.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Britain’s big issues and how Labour plans to address them</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Britain’s multiple overlapping crises developed over years, and they won’t be instantly solved just by a change in leadership.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take the UK’s battered public services. When the Conservatives (also known as the Tories) came to power in 2010 under current Foreign Minister David Cameron, the world was reeling from the 2008 financial crisis. The UK was particularly hard-hit, with much of its economy based in the financial sector.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To dig the country out of dire financial straits, Cameron’s government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/sep/10/how-austerity-and-ideology-broke-britain">decided to disinvest in social services</a> like the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jul/05/austerity-has-led-to-nhs-quality-of-care-deteriorating-across-the-board-study-finds#:~:text=11%20months%20old-,Austerity%20has%20led%20to%20NHS%20quality%20of,in%20key%20areas%2C%20study%20finds&amp;text=The%20quality%20of%20care%20that,more%20common%2C%20research%20has%20found.">national health service</a> (NHS), education, and transit, particularly the railways. That choice still reverberates today, and has meant long waits to see doctors, crumbling public schools, wage stagnation in the care and state services sectors and, accordingly, labor strikes to protest working conditions and pay.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And though the economic and cost of living crisis is not unique to the UK, some Tory decisions have made its situation uniquely challenging. The choice to leave the European Union, first decided in a referendum in 2016 and pushed through by Conservative Prime Minister Boris Johnson in 2019, has had detrimental effects to trade, employment, and the cost of living. <a href="https://www.niesr.ac.uk/publications/revisiting-effect-brexit?type=global-economic-outlook-topical-feature">One independent analysis estimated</a> that the UK’s real GDP is about 2 to 3 percent lower today than it would be if it had stayed in the EU. The <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/overview/survey-results/daily/2024/06/12/69919/1">decision to leave the EU is now deeply unpopular</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Tories have overseen “singularly the worst economic performance of any decade in Britain since the Napoleonic era,” Ansell said, making Labour’s promised change —&nbsp;ambiguous though it is — attractive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scandals and policy flip-flops didn’t help Conservatives either. <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/7/7/23198063/boris-johnson-prime-minister-resigns">Johnson fell from grace</a> following a series of scandals known as Partygate, in which he allowed or participated in social gatherings during the Covid-19 pandemic, while the rest of the country was in lockdown. Following his <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/6/10/23756380/boris-johnson-resign-tory-party-sunak-next-dorries-adams">2022 ouster</a>, Liz Truss — Johnson’s foreign secretary — won leadership of the party and the country. She lasted all of 44 days following her proposal to cut taxes on corporations and the ultra-wealthy that was so disastrous it threw <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66897881">global bond markets into panic</a> for weeks. Current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak followed her, positioning himself as the adult in the room who could set things straight.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But his signature policy position has been to “stop the boats,” referring to the surge in irregular migration via small boats crossing the English Channel from Europe. To do that, his government has pursued a policy to detain and deport irregular migrants to Rwanda. In addition to effectively violating the right to asylum, the plan has been ineffective; no one has been sent to Rwanda, although some migrants have been detained under the scheme, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/sep/19/cost-housing-asylum-seekers-hotels-rise-home-office">costing the government an estimated 8 million pounds per day</a>. It’s also worth noting: migrants seeking asylum make up <a href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN01403/SN01403.pdf">only about 11 percent of Britain’s migrant</a> population.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And though migration overall <a href="https://www.brunel.ac.uk/news-and-events/news/articles/Post-Brexit-UK-migration-trends-and-the-all-time-highs#:~:text=Contrary%20to%20expectations%2C%20the%20new,double%20this%20amount%2C%20totalling%20333%2C000.">was at an all-time high in 2022</a>, much of the electorate doesn’t actually see migration <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/society/trackers/the-most-important-issues-facing-the-country-full">as one of their top three issues</a> —&nbsp;and people’s feelings about migration are <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/uk-public-opinion-toward-immigration-overall-attitudes-and-level-of-concern/#:~:text=Public%20opinion%20on%20migration%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20is%20divided&amp;text=In%20April%202023%2C%2032%25%20thought,lot)%20(Figure%201).">highly fractured</a>. In a sense, the Tory government suffered from a crisis of its own making with the Rwanda policy and the Illegal Migration Act —&nbsp;instituting draconian policies that haven’t been successful and that voters see as costly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of this dysfunction culminated in the Tories’ defeat. (Heading into the election, <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/06/27/keir-starmer-should-be-britains-next-prime-minister">the Economist even endorsed Labour for the first time in almost two decades</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour’s signature achievements in the post-World War II era have been forming the NHS and instituting a national minimum wage. Now, the party has to tackle three overlapping marquee issues: the economy and cost of living; struggling government services; and migration policy. But, as outlined in its <a href="https://labour.org.uk/updates/stories/labour-manifesto-2024-sign-up/">election manifesto</a>, Labour’s policy suggestions aren’t terribly specific or fleshed out in most cases. In the short term, the party is likely to focus on trying to create a stable government to prove it should maintain power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the short term Starmer and Labour have promised to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-68984778">undo the Rwanda policy immediately</a> on gaining power, focusing on the human smuggling groups that operate and profit from the dangerous boat crossings. Labour says the government <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2q0rvgv25xo">will again allow irregular migrants to apply for asylum</a>, and has promised to sort through the backlog of asylum cases which have not been processed due to the Illegal Migration Act.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the economy, Labour has promised to <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/kickstart-economic-growth/#industrial-strategy">invest in industry and create a pro-business environment,</a> without outlining what that means specifically. In terms of managing the cost of living crisis, Labour could increase the minimum wage or encourage cities to adopt “living wages,” <a href="https://www.oxford.gov.uk/fairer-economy/oxford-living-wage#:~:text=Oxford%20Living%20Wage%20Overview,by%20the%20Living%20Wage%20Foundation.">as Oxford has</a>, a localized norm that recognizes the different cost of living in different areas.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour will opt to “improve the UK’s trade and investment relationship with the EU, by tearing down unnecessary barriers to trade,” though it will not rejoin the EU or the common market. Negotiating agreements about agriculture and livestock aim to bring down food costs, and professional services agreements will help UK professionals work in EU countries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour has also promised to “<a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/build-an-nhs-fit-for-the-future/">save the NHS</a>” and build a health service for the future. But that will require public investment, as Starmer’s party has promised the service will always be publicly funded. That means money from somewhere, and raising individual taxes right now isn’t an appealing option given the economic challenges facing many voters. In the short term, Labour promises to reduce wait times, enlist the private sector to help deal with high volume, and improve relations with the health care unions.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">But can Labour deliver —&nbsp;and maintain power?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How exactly Labour plans to accomplish their goals is an open question. Labour doesn’t really have a strong, bold new policy regarding the economy; there isn’t a big, splashy ideological framework.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And on one of the major factors dragging Britain’s economy down — Brexit — Labour plans to negotiate agreements about agriculture and livestock with the EU to bring down food costs, and hopes to make professional services agreements that will help UK professionals work in EU countries. Still, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/article/2024/jun/22/starmer-growth-plan-doomed-access-eu-markets-economists">many of the economic pains of Brexit may remain</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And on migration, other than scrapping the Rwanda plan, there’s not too much daylight between Labour and the Tories.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The current government already has quite a large focus on enforcement,” <a href="https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/about/people/ben-brindle/">Ben Brindle</a>, a researcher at the Oxford Migration Observatory, told Vox. Labour’s approach is “still doing many of the things which the current enforcement operation is already doing” to deter irregular migration. And when it comes to migration for students and skilled labor, net migration is likely to go down anyway due to policies already in place, rather than anything Labour is actually doing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Labour does have <a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/kickstart-economic-growth/#get-britain-building-again">proposals on hand to address the housing</a> and transit crises —&nbsp;including by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-20/starmer-s-labour-eyes-blitz-of-uk-planning-reforms-within-weeks?sref=qYiz2hd0">loosening up building restrictions</a> in the immediate term&nbsp;so that new housing, infrastructure, and transit services can actually be built, which could help stimulate the economy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’re using a planning regime that was created in 1948, that is incredibly stringent, and means that we’re just not building things anywhere,” Ansell said. “We have a housing crisis. We have a transportation crisis, and we have a public infrastructure crisis and an energy crisis — it’s all because we can’t build stuff. That gives [Labour] a narrative. It also gives businesses the expectation that actually there’s going to be loads and loads of infrastructure or investment and probably over quite a period of time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, though, Labour sees building a stable government, especially after the years of uncertainty post-Brexit, as a useful framing — but potentially a part of its mandate. The party’s manifesto is built around the idea that it “can stop the chaos” which has helped exacerbate external problems into national crises when it is in power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last century, people have started demanding more from the businesses where they shop. Whether it be <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22632448/xinjiang-cotton-ban-china-uyghurs-fast-fashion">a pair of jeans</a> or <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/22766151/tyson-poultry-plant-worker-safety-meat-processing">the food</a> on <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/15/23296481/fast-food-ab257-california-sectoral-labor-unions" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/8/15/23296481/fast-food-ab257-california-sectoral-labor-unions">their plates</a>, consumers want to know that what they’re buying isn’t just <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23529587/consumer-goods-quality-fast-fashion-technology">good quality</a> but also ethically and sustainably made. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the early 20th century, groups like the National Consumers League and the now-defunct League of Women Shoppers organized consumers <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/01/ethical-consumption-labor-movement-organize-working-class-consumer-movement">to take advantage of their power</a> in an effort to improve labor protections and the rights of workers in the United States. Today, ethically minded consumers are <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2021/10/05/do-consumers-care-about-ethical-sourcing/">also motivated</a> by climate change and animal rights, as the consequences of our overconsumption have become clearer. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fast-forward 90 years and the global marketplace has become exponentially more complex. Globalization has remade how and where corporations make products. If it was difficult for activists at the turn of the 20th century to identify ethically made products, the challenge to the modern consumer is even greater.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might think regulations or legislation could compel companies to produce more ethically made goods. But ultimately, no one government is responsible for a supply chain that crosses borders and oceans. In a globalized economy, nobody is in charge. So “corporate social responsibility” — or the idea that companies can hold themselves accountable — emerged, responding to this consumer demand.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In practice, corporate social responsibility can look like companies donating to charities every year, committing to net-zero emissions by a certain date, or focusing on labor practices. To prove they’re doing this work, companies will partner with nonprofits or hire third-party consultants to audit their supply chains, and then measure and report their progress in annual reports, press releases, and on their websites.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These practices are now nominally widespread in modern business. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/smartway/resources-corporate-social-responsibility-csr-and-freight-sustainability-planning">According to the EPA</a>, roughly 80 percent of all Fortune 500 and S&amp;P 500 companies publish a report on their corporate social responsibility practices and progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while corporate social responsibility sounds good on paper, the workers deep within these corporations’ supply chains — the ones that sew the clothes you wear and harvest the produce and ingredients for your food — say that they are not feeling the benefits of such programs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the profits they help companies rake in through their labor, many of these <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22278245/garment-workers-bangladesh-unpaid-factories-sweatpants">workers are still making pennies</a> while stuck <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/6/16/23762593/child-labor-laws-republicans-agriculture-farm-care-act">working in unsafe environments</a>. In some cases, the conditions are so bad that they amount to exploitation that is clearly unethical and, in many cases, illegal, as many <a href="https://www.workersrights.org/issues/">labor rights advocates</a> and <a href="https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/big-issues/labour-rights/">corporate watchdogs</a> have argued. Some of what corporate responsibility programs claim they’re doing and have achieved, workers and advocates say, qualifies as greenwashing or “social washing” — using these strategies and initiatives to <a href="https://grist.org/accountability/companies-are-claiming-to-be-plastic-neutral-is-it-greenwashing/">mislead the public</a> and appear as if they have robust, effective environmental or labor practices. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To fill the gap between a commitment and reality, collectives of workers and labor advocates worldwide are organizing to create a solution that will not just address labor abuses when they happen but encourage the prevention of exploitation altogether. They come from a variety of industries, and they’re leaving the promises of corporate social responsibility behind and creating something new — and more importantly, effective — in its place: worker-driven social responsibility. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What is corporate social responsibility?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The price of America’s rapid industrialization at the turn of the 20th century, which brought dramatic economic expansion and the proliferation of consumer goods, was unchecked corporate power. It was common for young children to be employed in dangerous workplaces, for factory workers to take home just a couple of dollars after hours of work, and for workers to be seriously injured or killed on the job. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In response to this power imbalance, activists and writers like Upton Sinclair pressured the government to enact various reforms, including labor rights. This period, known as the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/progressive-era-to-new-era-1900-1929/overview/">progressive era</a>, was marked by a growing sense of humanitarian concern for the vulnerable and the idea that the government should do something about it. (Though people of color and immigrants were largely excluded from these conversations and reforms.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1953, Howard Bowen, an American economist known as the “father of corporate social responsibility,” argued that business owners should also take the idea of human welfare seriously in his book, <em>Social Responsibilities of the Businessman</em>. He said the choices of businessmen have significant influence on the lives of everyday people, and thus, businesses should operate in a way that considers “valued social goals,” like a high standard of living, personal security, and justice. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Corporate social responsibility went mainstream during the new wave of globalization and the growth of multinational corporations that followed in the second half of the 20th century. As these businesses expanded their reach and production speed, they sought to cut their costs by contracting cheaper labor in other countries with weak worker protections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This idea of outsourcing wasn’t necessarily new. Businesses in the US already had a <a href="https://prospect.org/labor/american-south-drives-low-wage-economy/">history</a> of moving to Southern states where they knew <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/rooted-racism-part1/?mc_cid=9f4d28fdab&amp;mc_eid=131a3ffbe6">corporate regulation was more relaxed and labor would be less expensive</a>, made possible by the racist legacy of slavery and Jim Crow laws. A century later, new technology — particularly the internet — made it even easier for companies to scale up and outsource their operations. By moving overseas, companies could obscure unsafe working conditions from American consumers, who might’ve known very little about how their products were being made. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But public awareness of the costs of globalization started to grow in the early 1990s, thanks to stories and reports from human rights organizations and newsrooms that laid out the abysmal working conditions and standards of major brands, often in their factories overseas. Nike, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1173928/leading-active-footwear-companies-by-sales-worldwide/">the world’s biggest shoe seller</a>, faced backlash after multiple stories came out about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/08/business/nike-shoe-plant-in-vietnam-is-called-unsafe-for-workers.html">grueling conditions</a> and the use of <a href="https://laborrights.org/in-the-news/six-cents-hour-1996-life-article">child labor</a> in its contracted factories, sparking boycotts and protests against Nike from consumers and activists alike. Businesses saw how consumers could rise against them if they weren’t careful about what went on in their supply chains, leading to more companies developing their own voluntary corporate social responsibility initiatives to address their environmental and social impacts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Today, corporate social responsibility programs are widespread. They often refer to commitments a company makes toward a particular area of social impact, like diversity, ethical sourcing, or the environment. It usually looks like this: A company will set goals around one or more of these areas, assess its progress, and then publish its results.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To legitimize these programs, companies will hire social auditing firms, seek certifications from multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) like the <a href="https://www.fairlabor.org/">Fair Labor Association</a> or <a href="https://www.fairtradecertified.org/">Fair Trade</a> to show they meet certain standards, or develop codes of conduct around labor and human rights. Such programs matter to consumers, and they’re <a href="https://sustainablebrands.com/read/marketing-and-comms/majority-of-us-consumers-say-they-will-pay-more-for-sustainable-products">willing to pay more</a> for sustainably made products — and hey, if something is good for both the world and for business, what’s the harm?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Corporate social responsibility in practice</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Corporate social responsibility is everywhere today, driven by consumer demand and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/afdhelaziz/2020/03/07/the-power-of-purpose-the-business-case-for-purpose-all-the-data-you-were-looking-for-pt-2/">a growing socially conscious workforce</a>. One 2023 study found that over 80 percent of companies are <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/over-80-of-companies-to-increase-budgets-for-environmental-sustainability-goals-over-next-year-honeywell-survey/">increasing their budgets</a> for sustainability initiatives. Chief sustainability officers are now common, and more companies are <a href="https://www.everlane.com/factories">disclosing the exact factories their products are made in and the reported conditions</a>.   </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s hard to know how honest or effective these programs really are at protecting labor and the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of the issue is they’re voluntary. While companies must comply with local, federal, and international laws, that’s the end of their legal obligations. Beyond that, there’s no requirement for corporate social responsibility programs to show their methodology or metrics for calculating their progress and no obligation to release all results from a social audit. A company can change its corporate social responsibility programs at any point, or drop them entirely.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of these initiatives also have a top-down approach: High-level management in a company will design its corporate social responsibility programs with no requirement to seek input from people they may impact. “That failure to really actively incorporate workers in a meaningful way in the auditing process means that social auditors miss huge things all the time,” said Charity Ryerson, executive director of the <a href="https://corpaccountabilitylab.org/">Corporate Accountability Lab.</a> </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One study that highlights these concerns in-depth is the 2020 <a href="https://www.msi-integrity.org/not-fit-for-purpose/">“Not Fit-for-Purpose”</a> report from <a href="https://www.msi-integrity.org/">the Institute for Multi-Stakeholder Initiative Integrity</a>. After 10 years of analyzing dozens of MSIs — tools that companies often use within their corporate social responsibility programs — the report found that broadly, MSIs were neither capable nor designed to hold corporations accountable for human rights abuses in their supply chains, and didn’t provide sufficient access to remedies for those impacted by such abuses. Well-known supply chain MSIs that have been around for decades, like Fairtrade International, the Rainforest Alliance, and the Fair Labor Association, were some of the many MSIs analyzed in their research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The report included interviews with workers at certified factories in Cameroon and the Philippines, in which workers said they were told ahead of time what to say during audits and were threatened with retaliation if they didn’t comply. If workers can be intimidated into keeping quiet, and if audits don’t catch that and move forward with certifying the factory as a fair workplace, then social auditing, certifications, and MSIs are, at best, well-intentioned but ineffective tools for preventing and correcting abuses. At worst, they preserve corporate power at the expense of communities affected by company activity. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Some [corporate social responsibility programs] have really good intentions and people working really hard,” Ryerson said. “Other ones were designed as a PR initiative, front to end.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Giving the veneer of social responsibility without actually addressing the underlying problems is misleading to consumers and harmful to the communities affected by these businesses’ operations. Businesses and corporations may tout their high standards for ethical sourcing or their commitment to ensuring safe working conditions across their supply chains — but in reality, many workers are still prone to abuse and exploitation because, fundamentally, the business model that created these poor working conditions hasn’t changed. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But some workers are organizing to disrupt that model entirely.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The rise of worker-driven social responsibility</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around the same time that corporate social responsibility was taking off in the 1990s, a group of farmworkers in a rural Florida town called Immokalee had a meeting that would challenge the status quo, from the bottom of the supply chain all the way to the top.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The farmworkers were Mexican, Guatemalan, and Haitian migrants, and they harvested buckets of tomatoes in grueling conditions for as long as 12 hours a day, receiving poverty wages for providing crucial produce to US grocery stores and restaurants. The fields they worked in were rife with verbal and physical abuse, sexual harassment, wage theft, and, in the worst cases, involuntary servitude. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tired of the exploitation they encountered in the fields, the Immokalee farmworkers discussed how they could really change the way things were done. This 1993 meeting marked the beginning of the <a href="https://ciw-online.org/">Coalition of Immokalee Workers</a> (CIW) and, later on, the first ever worker-driven social responsibility program. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lucas Benitez, one of the founders of the CIW, told me that, at first, the farmworkers thought their employers, the tomato growers, had all the power. “Then we came to see and recognize what was essentially an invisible hand that was putting that pressure further and further down on the supply chain,” Benitez said via an interpreter. “That started at the top, because it’s those retailers that fundamentally dictate to growers the conditions under which that food is being produced. And so that’s really where the power lay, and so that’s where we turned.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2001, the CIW set its sights on Taco Bell and called for a boycott over the reportedly <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/30/world/ciw-fair-food-program-freedom-project/index.html">abysmal conditions</a> in its tomato supply chain. Four years later, <a href="https://ciw-online.org/blog/2005/03/agreement-analysis/">Taco Bell signed an agreement</a> that included vital demands from the CIW: Taco Bell would pay a premium for its tomatoes that would go directly to workers’ paychecks, it would only buy from growers who met the code of conduct that protected workers, and this would be monitored and enforced by an investigative body with help from the CIW. It was all backed by a legally binding contract.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A binding contract is crucial to worker-driven social responsibility, a sharp contrast to those toothless corporate social responsibility initiatives. If one of the tomato growers that Taco Bell bought from was found not to be passing on the premium to workers’ pay or wasn’t living up to the code of conduct, then Taco Bell was obligated to stop buying from the grower until they corrected their actions. Thus, it incentivized the growers to abide by the standards set by this agreement. Corporate social responsibility programs, on the other hand, don’t regulate themselves in this way because no legal agreements are involved.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By 2011, the first worker-driven social responsibility program, created by the CIW, had a name: the <a href="https://fairfoodprogram.org/">Fair Food Program</a>. Since then, it has secured agreements with McDonald’s, Trader Joe’s, Walmart, and other major retailers, and now covers <a href="https://fairfoodprogram.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/FFP_2021-SOTP-REPORT_ENGLISH_client_download.pdf">90 percent of tomato growers in Florida</a>. In mid-June, <a href="https://ciw-online.org/blog/2024/06/ciw-fair-food-program-join-secretary-of-agriculture-tom-vilsack-ffp-participating-farmers-for-announcement-of-historic-program/">the CIW announced</a> that 27 farms covering thousands of workers are set to join the Fair Food Program after the United States Department of Agriculture <a href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2024/06/14/usda-awards-50-million-support-farmworkers-and-agricultural">announced</a> big financial incentives for farms that strengthen worker protections. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Fair Food Program has also expanded its operations and strengthened its standards since that first contract. It now includes worker-to-worker education sessions and monitoring from the Fair Food Standards Council, which audits farms extensively, operates a 24/7 complaint line for farmworkers, and investigates potential violations of the Fair Food Program. Its work evolves as workers face new challenges: A few years ago, the Fair Food Program added <a href="https://ciw-online.org/blog/2021/08/relief-from-the-heat/">heat protections</a> to its standards as the threat of climate change on workers grows and the absence of a federal <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/356217/osha-federal-workplace-heat-standard-protections">workplace heat standard</a> leaves most farmworkers endangered. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to its website, the Fair Food Program has resulted in more than $45 million being added to workers’ paychecks, over 82,000 farmworkers attending worker-to-worker education sessions, and over 9,300 violations caught during audits and addressed by growers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There has been a bright light of not only hope but real and positive change in the darkness of continuing violence and human rights violations,” wrote Susan Marquis, a visiting professor at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs, in <a href="https://clje.law.harvard.edu/worker-driven-social-responsibility-a-new-proven-model-for-defining-claiming-and-protecting-workers-human-rights/">an extensive report.</a> “In Fair Food Program fields, abuse long endemic to our nation’s large-scale agricultural operations is now effectively eliminated.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The concept has spread to workers in other industries across the US and around the world.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A group of dairy workers was directly inspired by the Fair Food Program to found <a href="https://migrantjustice.net/">Migrant Justice</a>, a farmworker-centered organization. After learning about the CIW’s work, Migrant Justice created its own worker-driven social responsibility program, <a href="https://migrantjustice.net/milk-with-dignity-campaign">Milk with Dignity</a>, that included all of the same standards as the Fair Food Program. Milk with Dignity got Ben and Jerry’s to sign on as its first retailer in 2017.<br><br>“For us, [the Fair Food Program] was a light,” former dairy worker and current Migrant Justice staffer Enrique Balcazar told me via an interpreter. “That was a really exciting thing to realize that there was this model … for us to bring change to our context to the dairy industry.”<br><br>On the other side of the world, around the time the Fair Food Program was established, <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22278245/garment-workers-bangladesh-unpaid-factories-sweatpants">garment workers in the Asian and Pacific regions</a> were facing increasingly serious issues of their own. As more major Western clothing brands <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/2023/11/14/23955673/fast-fashion-shein-hauls-environment-human-rights-violations">outsourced work overseas</a>, garment workers were forced to work in <a href="https://cleanclothes.org/fashions-problems">unsafe conditions</a>, like factories housed in dilapidated buildings with little to no safety standards — a dangerous combination that led to fatalities in the form of fires and building collapses. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Bangladesh, one of the world’s largest clothing exporters, human rights groups and labor organizations worked together to create a program that would legally bind brands to address working conditions and safety in Bangladesh factories in order to prevent these fires and collapses from happening again and again. Unfortunately, they had little success getting signatories until after the worst disaster in the garment industry struck. In 2013, a building that housed multiple garment factories called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/fashion/rana-plaza-anniversary.html">Rana Plaza collapsed</a>, killing over 1,110 workers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/04/17/decade-after-rana-plaza-safety-flaws-persist">Rana Plaza had been audited</a> prior to the collapse, and a day before the tragedy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/world/asia/after-building-collapse-tears-and-rage-as-hope-fades-in-bangladesh.html">cracks were discovered in the building</a>. Yet, workers were told it was safe to go to work. The Worker Rights Consortium, an independent labor rights monitoring group, <a href="https://www.workersrights.org/commentary/10-years-after-rana-plaza-collapse-founding-group-behind-the-accord-on-health-and-safety-calls-on-fashion-industry-to-learn-their-lesson/">wrote</a> that brand audits and inspections failed to check for critical safety issues, like fire exits or building integrity. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A month after the Rana Plaza collapse, 43 corporations based in over a dozen countries, alongside local and global trade unions, signed the <a href="https://www.bangladeshaccord.org/">Accord on Fire and Building Safety</a> in Bangladesh. It required participating retailers to provide financial support so suppliers could afford safety renovations, education sessions around worker safety, consistent inspections, and a mechanism for workers to make complaints and independent investigators to follow through — all key aspects for creating a legitimately safe workplace.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since this first agreement, the Accord has evolved into <a href="https://internationalaccord.org/">the International Accord</a> and expanded to Pakistan. While there’s still a long way to go before the garment industry as a whole is free from hazardous conditions, the International Accord has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/24/fashion/rana-plaza-anniversary.html">a major step</a> toward creating a safer, more sustainable environment for garment workers covered by the agreement.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Where is worker-driven social responsibility going?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the success of the worker-driven social responsibility model shouldn’t be underestimated, it’s still in its early stages and has not quite yet become a household name in the business world. Organizing meaningful change takes time. The responsibility shouldn’t be placed entirely on workers to end their exploitation: Governments need to improve regulations and enforcement to protect workers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s still an exciting moment for worker-driven social responsibility, as a growing number of industries outside of the US are looking at the model. <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ethicalcampaigns/funding-worker-driven-rights-programme-spain">Funding has been secured</a> to explore worker-driven social responsibility in Spain’s farms, where migrant workers face abysmal conditions; a <a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/ilab/ilab20230214">$2.5 million dollar grant from the Department of Labor</a> was awarded to implement a worker-driven social responsibility program like the Fair Food Program in Chile, Mexico, and South Africa; and in the United Kingdom, they’re about six months into their worker-driven social responsibility pilot program in <a href="https://labourexploitation.org/news/announcement-europes-first-worker-driven-social-responsibility-initiative-launches-pilot-to-fight-the-exploitation-of-workers-at-sea/">northeast Scotland’s seafood industry</a>, where migrant fishers are often isolated, paid low wages, and abused. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We need to make sure that the only model that is given any credibility and is demanded by the supply chain is something that centers workers,” Chris Williams, a fisheries expert with the <a href="https://www.itfglobal.org/en">International Transport Workers’ Federation</a> working on the pilot program in Scotland, told me. ”Because otherwise, it’s all just a waste of time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The exploration of worker-driven social responsibility across different industries doesn’t just center workers — it’s led by them, too. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers is involved in all of these developing projects as the expert and original pioneer of this emerging field. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“With [worker-driven social responsibility, we’re no longer letting the foxes guard the henhouse,” Benitez, co-founder of the CIW, told me. “We as workers are protecting our own rights.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By now, you may have heard the news that President Joe Biden is old — so old that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/biden-debate-performance-democrats/index.html">even some Democrats</a> are calling on him to drop out of the presidential race.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden, of course, is not the only old high-ranking American politician. His main opponent, Donald Trump, is 78, and the median age in the US Senate is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/01/30/house-gets-younger-senate-gets-older-a-look-at-the-age-and-generation-of-lawmakers-in-the-118th-congress/">over 65 years old</a>. In fact, American politicians have aged so much that the United States has been <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/faa721e6-4fcf-4b9b-ae39-9ad6c44ed971">dubbed a gerontocracy</a> — a system of government where power is concentrated among the elderly.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is absolutely nothing wrong with older people holding positions of power. If voters want experienced officials to lead the country, then the chances are that those officials will skew older than the average worker. What is concerning, however, is just how over-represented older Americans are in national politics, and how that could lead to a political class that’s out of touch with the many challenges that younger people face.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That concern is only compounded when politicians share little information about their health. The late Dianne Feinstein, for example, spent the last few years of her life clinging to her Senate seat, even as she approached 90, despite serious concerns <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/dianne-feinsteins-missteps-raise-a-painful-age-question-among-senate-democrats">about her mental fitness</a> and clear signs of cognitive decline, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/politics/article/dianne-feinstein-senate-17079487.php">including memory loss</a>. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, 82, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/sen-mitch-mcconnell-appears-freeze-kentucky-event-rcna102583">appeared to freeze</a> in multiple public appearances last year before eventually announcing that he plans to step down from his role. And more recently, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/politics/biden-lapses.html">Biden’s missteps and disastrous debate performance</a> have sparked a panic about whether the 81-year-old president is actually capable of campaigning, let alone executing his official duties.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A lot of Americans are frustrated with the fact that the choices they have for president in the last few election cycles <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/majority-americans-think-both-biden-and-trump-are-too-old-serve-second-terms">have been older candidates</a> — so old that each would have been the oldest president in history. (Biden is the oldest president to date; Trump, if elected, would break that record by the end of his term.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But part of the reason that voters seem to have so few choices is because one of the major pipelines to the presidency is Congress, which itself has been getting older. In fact, the current Congress is <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/aging-congress-boomers/">the oldest in American history</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That there are so many aging politicians has prompted many to call for simple solutions, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/04/most-americans-favor-maximum-age-limits-for-federal-elected-officials-supreme-court-justices/">including age limits</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But having so many older politicians is a symptom of deeper problems with our democracy, which won’t be addressed by simply banning older people from running for public office. Democracies should be representative, and having younger people underrepresented among lawmakers can lead to a government that fails to adapt to a changing world.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why are American politicians so old?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The most straightforward explanation for why America’s elected representatives have been getting older is simply that the American population as a whole has, too. The median age in the United States <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/population-estimates-characteristics.html">is now 39</a>, according to the US Census Bureau, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/us/census-median-age.html">up from 30 in 1980</a>, and baby boomers are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/07/24/baby-boomers-us-labor-force/">staying in the workforce</a> much longer than earlier generations. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While that might explain why elected officials are getting older, it doesn’t necessarily explain cases like Feinstein’s or McConnell’s or Biden’s — people serving into their 80s while battling public concerns about their health — or why <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/11/10/1135856127/congress-is-older-than-ever-it-hasnt-always-been-this-way">roughly a quarter of Congress</a> is made up of members who are over 70.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s where signs of an eroding democracy start to emerge.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because if voters want to elect an 80-year-old, they should have the right to do so; having older politicians would be the outcome of a democratic process. In reality, many Americans don’t actually have that much of a choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because there are systemic barriers to having any real competition, in most cases allowing incumbent members of Congress to stay in power as long as they please. (Biden, after all, served in the Senate for 36 years before becoming vice president in 2009.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past century, congressional elections have been <a href="https://jackson.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Kustov-et-al.-2021.pdf">getting less and less competitive</a>. And in recent years, the vast majority of House races have been won by a <a href="https://fairvote.org/report/dubious-democracy-2022/">10-point margin or higher</a>. In 2018, for example, only 44 out of the 435 congressional districts were considered toss-ups — that is, decided within a 5-point margin — <a href="https://fairvote.org/report/dubious-democracy-2022/">according to the advocacy group FairVote</a>. In 2022, it was even lower, with 36 House elections being considered competitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As competition declined, the average age of congressional members rose. In 1981, for example, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/aging-congress-boomers/#:~:text=Data%20for%20the%20118th%20Congress,median%20representative%20never%20surpassed%2055">median age of a US senator was 52</a>; in 2022, it was 65.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two main reasons why House elections are so uncompetitive: polarization and gerrymandering. As Americans became more polarized, they became more loyal to their political parties. That meant that fewer and fewer Americans <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2024/05/29/is-ticket-splitting-back-00160530">split their tickets</a> — voting for, say, a Democratic presidential candidate while also voting for a Republican candidate for the House or Senate — making congressional districts safer during a general election. And more importantly, partisan gerrymandering, where lawmakers draw up congressional districts to benefit one party, has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/aggressive-gerrymandering-may-make-elections-far-less-competitive-experts-say-n1284179">made competitive elections all the more rare</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means that most congressional elections are essentially decided by the primaries. Once someone wins a primary in a very safe Democratic or Republican district, for example, the general election becomes nothing more than a formality. But there’s another roadblock to real competition during the primaries as well, one that leads to politicians serving longer tenures: <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/reelection-rates">the power of incumbency</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Incumbents tend to have a sizable advantage over their challengers for various reasons, including name recognition, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-democrats-launch-pac-protect-incumbents-attacks-within-n1272428">party support</a>, and <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/incumbent-advantage">campaign cash</a>. In fact, while you might hear of some surprising upsets from time to time — like in 2018, when Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), who was 29 at the time, defeated Joe Crowley, who had served in Congress for two decades — it’s actually extraordinarily rare for incumbents to lose their primaries. According to the Brookings Institution, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-2018-primaries-project-introduction-to-the-candidates/">only a handful of incumbents</a> lose their primaries each cycle. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Massachusetts is one example of a state whose lawmakers notoriously <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022-09-28/64-of-beacon-hill-lawmakers-face-no-reelection-challenge-nov-8">face little competition</a>: In 2022, not one of its incumbent members of the US House of Representatives faced a primary challenger.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The result of a system like this is that incumbents can hold onto their seats for decades — or until they choose to retire. That means that while voters technically can vote for whomever they want, they have very little say in who appears on their ballots and whether there are any serious alternatives to choose from.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The solution isn’t age limits. It’s giving voters more choice.</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politicians in the United States are old by design. From campaign financing to gerrymandering to third parties having to face often <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/how-us-states-make-it-tough-third-parties-elections-2024-01-18/">insurmountable hurdles to appear on a ballot</a>, incumbent politicians can essentially stay in office as long as they like.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Polls show that <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/10/04/most-americans-favor-maximum-age-limits-for-federal-elected-officials-supreme-court-justices/">most Americans support imposing age limits</a> on federal lawmakers, and there have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/11/us/north-dakota-age-limit-election.html">some efforts</a> in recent years to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/john-james-age-limits-trump-75-constitutional-amendment-2023-9">try to implement them</a>. But while age limits would certainly remove the possibility of having too many older people in office, they also have many problems: For starters, they’re discriminatory, barring people from participating in certain aspects of democracy simply because of their characteristics. People also don’t age uniformly, and while one person might start showing signs of cognitive decline in their 70s, another person might be perfectly capable of serving in office well into their 80s. Deciding an age cutoff based on scientific averages of physical and mental health can also be relatively arbitrary, especially with medical treatment getting better and life expectancies getting longer over time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second problem with age limits is that they do not address the underlying problem, which is that there’s very little competition in elections.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s why efforts should largely focus on making elections fairer and more competitive: By making incumbency less of a guarantee that a candidate will win an election, turnover in Congress and elsewhere will be higher, and it will be more possible for younger people to get elected. That would help create a reality where elected officials are more representative of their constituencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To get there, lawmakers should focus on democratic reforms that include limiting partisan gerrymandering, making it more affordable to run for office, giving deep-pocketed donors less influence, and improving ballot access.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those technical reforms might not immediately make Congress younger, and certainly won’t solve the current crisis of confidence faced by Biden, but they would make this era of gerontocracy less likely to happen again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They would also give voters a chance to elect whomever they want — be it a young up-and-comer or a retiree looking to jump back into the workforce by serving their country in public office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s ultimately what voters should have: choice.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every so often, a true crime case comes along that seems to be a Rorschach test — where there’s so much complicated, compelling, and contradictory evidence on all sides that it becomes easy to believe what you want to believe.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s arguably the best way to describe why the case of Karen Read, which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/karen-read-murder-trial.html">deadlocked</a> a “starkly divided” jury after an intense nine-week trial, has hypnotized and polarized the city of Boston, and increasingly the rest of the nation. Following Judge Beverly Cannone’s declaration of a mistrial, the prosecution immediately vowed to pursue a retrial. That likely means heightened public interest and further entrenchment of the bitter camps in this case.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The prosecution alleges that Read, a successful finance analyst and adjunct professor who’s far from the “typical” murder suspect, killed her boyfriend, 46-year-old Boston police officer John O’Keefe, in the early, snowy morning hours of January 29, 2022. According to prosecutors, Read, who stood trial for second-degree murder and manslaughter, deliberately backed into O’Keefe with her SUV while she was intoxicated, then drove home, leaving him lying in the cold. O’Keefe <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/karen-read-trial-john-okeefe-death-what-know-rcna155905">died from</a> blunt force trauma and hypothermia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among the main pieces of evidence in the state’s favor: Read herself asking various witnesses, “Could I have hit him?” the next morning, after awakening and returning to the house to look for him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Read, on the other hand, alleges that she’s been framed, in a spiraling conspiracy that began with a party full of witnesses lying about what happened and soon encompassing the entire Boston Police Department (BPD) and the prosecutor’s office. While from one standpoint, Read’s defense may be grasping at straws in its attempt to paint the case as a frame-up; from another, it’s the kind of police work Bostonians — and those in other cities across the country — have come to expect.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The trial has developed from what initially seemed to investigators like an open-and-shut case into a reckoning with a criminal justice system the public no longer trusts.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The murky facts of the case</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Read claims that after she and O’Keefe spent until <a href="https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/05/10/karen-read-murder-trial-day-9-a-full-day-of-new-witnesses/">around midnight</a> drinking at a local bar, she dropped O’Keefe off to hang out at the home of retired BPD officer Brian Albert. Several people who were either members of the BPD or affiliated with the local justice system were also at the house, but no one who was there corroborates her story. Not one of them says they saw O’Keefe enter the building; instead, they all claim they had no idea O’Keefe had even arrived at the house until his body was located outside of it in the snow the next morning. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Read, however, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZvaqbbul6o">maintains</a> that she watched O’Keefe go into the house before she left the scene. She alleges that O’Keefe must have been injured inside the house, that the partygoers staged the crime scene to look like a hit-and-run, and that they have lied about it ever since. Her defense argues that the injuries O’Keefe sustained resulted from a physical fight and a dog attack from a German shepherd mix Albert owned.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The defense alleges the investigation was hindered from the start by a failure to treat the Albert house as a possible crime scene and a failure to treat the witnesses as possible persons of interest; <a href="https://apnews.com/article/karen-read-officer-death-boston-officer-testimony-298b2aa70e1b6d8b13cc556daf3b4b0c">two</a> of the primary investigative team members also have <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-day-13/3371005/">personal links</a> to the witnesses. Further undermining the police were the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/police-red-plastic-cups-collect-204315489.html">bizarre methods</a> they used, including using leaf blowers to clear away snow (and potentially evidence) at the crime scene, and using <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-items-police-used-scene-john-okeefes-death-canton-shown-court/L7ZEE2HGAVEU5NKMINUYB6KJWQ/">solo cups and grocery bags</a> to collect evidence. Add to that a parade of unprofessional conduct and comments from officers, particularly from a lead investigator <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/michael-proctor-relieved-of-duty-state-police-say-after-karen-read-mistrial/3416025/">who was fired</a> immediately after the mistrial, and the case has morphed into a genuine public scandal. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the investigation and the widely publicized trial, a highly vocal contingent of supporters from Boston and beyond have made Read into a true crime cause célèbre; one <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/809459493961162/">Facebook group</a> supporting her has over 50,000 members. Thanks to <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/351238/serial-true-crime-podcast-criminal-justice-adnan-syed">a decade of thriving interest in true crime</a>, trial-watchers are hyper-vigilant to potential injustices and the shortcomings of law enforcement. In the eyes of many, the case has become a referendum on corrupt cops — a subject Bostonians <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/investigations/cdl-bribery-scheme-is-one-of-several-recent-misconduct-cases-plaguing-mass-state-police/3263475/">know</a> all too well after decades of police misconduct ranging from <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/mass-state-trooper-ordered-to-falsify-records-cleared-of-wrongdoing/1959608/">cover-ups</a> to <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/ex-head-of-mass-state-police-union-gets-prison-for-fraud-racketeering/3042305/">kickbacks</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Read’s relentless conspiracy defense has been driven by incendiary star lawyer Alan Jackson, a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-xpm-2013-feb-06-la-me-jackson-20130207-story.html">former prosecutor</a> turned defense attorney who’s defended both <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24144453/harvey-weinstein-overturned-conviction-explained-eliza-orlins-molineaux-rule-sandoval">Harvey Weinstein</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/3/16602628/kevin-spacey-sexual-assault-allegations-house-of-cards">Kevin Spacey</a>. O’Keefe, the victim, has been fully overshadowed by the conversation around the case, with Read’s supporters <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-aidan-kearney-turtleboy-canton-massachusetts/">allegedly</a> <a href="https://www.courttv.com/title/okeefe-family-reportedly-being-harassed-by-read-supporters/">harassing</a> his family members.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This polarization outside of the courtroom seems to have been reflected in the jury. After deliberating for less than a week, the jury tried repeatedly to declare themselves deadlocked to Judge Cannone, sending her notes to that effect. “We find ourselves deeply divided by fundamental differences in our opinions and state of mind,” a note from the day of the mistrial <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-deadlocked-jury-note/3415285/">read</a>, citing “deeply held convictions that each of us carry, ultimately leading to a point where consensus is unattainable.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A deadlocked or hung jury results in a mistrial, after which the prosecution has to decide whether to retry the case. In this case, the prosecution seems intent on a retrial — despite the many, many problems with their arguments. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The prosecution’s case is a circumstantial mess</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite presenting over 70 witnesses at trial, the prosecution’s primary evidence against Read remains largely circumstantial — meaning there’s very little direct or physical evidence backing their theory of what happened — and Read’s defense has offered up alternative theories for much of it. The timeline of the evening goes like this: After leaving a bar in Canton, Massachusetts, Read — whose blood alcohol content was likely <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-brian-higgins/">over</a> the legal limit — drove O’Keefe to Albert’s house. There, she either saw him safely inside or backed over him in the snow. In either event, she left the scene and drove home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Afterward, she left him an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-live-stream-today-day-27/">angry voicemail</a> declaring, “John, I fucking hate you.” Throughout the night, <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/06/20/karen-read-murder-trial-livestream-video-thursday-june-20/">Read called</a> O’Keefe and numerous other people. Early the next morning, she met up with two friends, including major prosecution witness Jennifer McCabe, who is also Albert’s sister-in-law, and drove back to Albert’s house, where they discovered O’Keefe in the snow. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-brian-higgins/">According to witnesses</a>, Read repeatedly asked whether O’Keefe could have been hit by a snow plow, or whether she could have hit him. Multiple first responders <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-massachusetts-murder-trial/">also testified</a> to hearing Read repeatedly exclaiming that she hit him, though none of them <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/court-video-updates-karen-read-murder-trial-continues-with-more-first-responder-testimony/CINVO2VGPJCVDF6JDAPI3VJ6PU/">noted this</a> in their <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/karen-read-trial-day-2-witness-testimony-continues/3354128/">initial reports</a> from the scene.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This alleged repeated refrain of, “Could I have hit him?” and “I hit him,” was one the prosecution <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/i-hit-him-prosecution-quotes-testimony-in-closing-argument-for-karen-read-case/61367569">leaned on heavily</a> as an argument for guilt. However, per witness accounts, Read also appeared to have no clear idea what had happened to O’Keefe. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What concrete evidence the prosecution did offer was hotly contested inside as well as outside the courtroom. One crucial piece: a broken taillight. An investigator who interviewed Read at her parents&#8217; house that night <a href="https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/state-police-lead-investigator-testifies-about-taillight-pieces-texts-at-karen-read-murder-trial/article_58683bd5-8ca1-55fc-9dcc-42da220c3228.html">reported</a> seeing “some damage” to the right rear light of Read’s SUV; he testified that it was allegedly “cracked and a piece was missing.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearly three weeks after O’Keefe’s death, the state’s lead investigator, Michael Proctor, <a href="https://www.courttv.com/title/scientist-compares-plastic-tail-light-pieces-in-karen-read-trial/">allegedly located</a> more fragments of a tail light at the crime scene and transported the evidence to the crime lab. <a href="https://www.thesunchronicle.com/news/local_news/state-police-lead-investigator-testifies-about-taillight-pieces-texts-at-karen-read-murder-trial/article_58683bd5-8ca1-55fc-9dcc-42da220c3228.html">Prosecutors say</a> they found minute traces of O’Keefe’s DNA on those fragments, as well as tiny particles from the tail light on some of O’Keefe’s clothes. Yet the defense hammered home the enormous delay in locating what would have been an incredibly significant piece of evidence, as well as the unreliability of evidence suddenly unearthed by Proctor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because Proctor has multiple personal ties to both the victim and the witnesses. In texts he sent a day after the investigation began, he used a <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-michael-proctor-texts/3395222/">misogynistic slur</a> to refer to Read, made it clear he thought Read’s guilt was obvious from the beginning, and even <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-murder-trial-live-stream-michael-proctor/">texted</a> his sister that he hoped Read would kill herself. The defense alleges Proctor helped frame Read for the murder, deliberately damaging her tail light in order to claim the damage was caused when she hit O’Keefe with her car. In fact, <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/karen-read-trial-mirrored-video-evidence-impact/61041808">a mysteriously altered video</a> of Read’s car that purportedly showed the damage made it all the way to trial before the defense pointed out that the image was misleadingly altered — a “mirror” video with the tail light in question inverted from its actual position.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It doesn’t help any of these optics that Proctor’s sister <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-michael-proctor-texts/3395222/">texted him</a> that Albert’s wife Julie wanted to send Proctor “a gift” after the investigation was over. Proctor protested on the stand that none of these texts impacted the integrity of the police investigation, but given Monday’s mistrial, some jurors may have disagreed with him. They evidently weren’t alone: State police announced that they had <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/canton-karen-read-case/michael-proctor-relieved-of-duty-state-police-say-after-karen-read-mistrial/3416025/">fired Proctor</a> immediately after the mistrial based on “information about serious misconduct [that] emerged in testimony” — an <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/10/19/21523030/police-unions-misconduct-accountability-brutality-massachusetts-reform-violence">extraordinarily rare move</a> on their part.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other facts of the case that on their surface might have supported the prosecution proved murkier on closer inspection. O’Keefe died of blunt-force trauma from a skull fracture and hypothermia, according to the medical examiner. He also had <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/19/metro/karen-read-trial-what-does-the-forensic-evidence-say/">gashes on his arms</a> that seemed unlikely to have been made from a car impact. The defense alleged these resulted from a dog attack on O’Keefe inside the house. O’Keefe also <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/karen-reads-boyfriend-john-okeefe-had-no-broken-bones-doctor-reveals">lacked</a> many of the injuries you’d expect to see from a car impact, such as broken bones or significant bruises. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The prosecution’s witnesses are also controversial. In addition to Read&#8217;s former friend McCabe, who had ties to both O’Keefe and the Alberts, the party attendees included several people that Read’s defense argued should have been investigated by police before taking the stand. Among them: Brian Higgins, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent who’d been <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/05/24/karen-read-trial-brian-higgins-flirty-texts-kiss/">sporadically flirting</a> with Read in the lead-up to O’Keefe’s death, and Albert’s son Colin, who as a teenager had made <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-murder-trial-day-13/">violent threats against other teens</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many of the witnesses who were at the party, including McCabe and the Alberts, exchanged a litany of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-irresolvable-tragedy-of-the-karen-read-case">phone calls to one another</a> throughout the time O’Keefe supposedly lay on the lawn, per phone records. Several later <a href="https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/why-so-many-butt-dials-who-called-who-and-when-in-the-karen-read-case/3384232/">testified</a> that the calls were “butt dials,” placed randomly and by complete mistake. As circumstances go, it’s eyebrow-raising, to say the least.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The defense’s evidence is equally unreliable</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite all the problems with the prosecution’s case, the strongest evidence for the defense is likewise fully debatable. One of the defense’s key witnesses was a veteran snowplow driver who made multiple trips past the Alberts’ house during the time O’Keefe was allegedly wounded in the snow, yet <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-trial-live-stream-today-day-28/">claimed</a> he saw no body lying anywhere on the lawn. However, snow impedes visibility, even with a bright snowplow light, and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-the-eyes-have-it/">eyewitness testimony</a> is notoriously unreliable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another piece of crucial evidence that many Read supporters consider a “smoking gun” for the defense has also been fully debunked by prosecution analysts. At issue: <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/karen-read-live-stream-today-day-16-jennifer-mccabe/">Two searches</a> McCabe made on her cellphone at some point during the early morning hours surrounding O’Keefe’s death, including a misspelled query, “Hos long to die in cold.” The prosecution claims, and McCabe testified, that she made the searches around six in the morning when she and Read found O’Keefe lying in the snow. The official cellphone records for the search, however, show the <a href="https://x.com/bostonherald/status/1793566054066569408">timestamp</a> for the search at 2:27 am. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The implication is that if McCabe searched for this then, she was part of a conspiracy to stage the scene and frame Read. But McCabe claims she merely opened that tab on her phone browser at 2:27 am, left it open, and searched the phrase hours later, after she and Read found him together. Multiple data analysts for the prosecution <a href="https://whdh.com/news/state-police-troopers-digital-forensic-expert-testify-as-karen-read-murder-trial-continues/">corroborated</a> this interpretation of the cellphone data. Still, the defense scored a point in their favor by <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/crime/2024/06/21/karen-read-murder-trial-livestream-video-friday-june-21/">noting</a> that their expert witness, who argued the search occurred at 2:27, arrived at his conclusion by using a method developed by one of the prosecution’s witnesses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other findings that leaned toward the defense included O’Keefe’s fitness tracker app, which showed him taking about 80 steps around the time Reed claimed she dropped him off. Yet here again, nothing about the timeline or O’Keefe’s activity is clear or corroborated by witnesses. The defense’s argument that O’Keefe was attacked inside the house, including by the family dog, is also speculative and unsupported by much evidence — which they claim is because the police never properly investigated. A medical expert <a href="https://www.boston25news.com/news/local/karen-read-trial-will-judge-allow-testimony-doctor-who-believes-okeefe-was-attacked-by-dog/67PPY2IWJ5DZTMVTK46CLMGEOE/">testified</a> on the stand in support of the dog bite theory, but forensic bite mark evidence is incredibly unreliable and has been more or less <a href="https://www.todaysrdh.com/the-unreliability-of-bitemark-evidence-implications-for-forensic-odontology-in-legal-proceedings/">fully debunked</a>, at least in cases involving humans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So where does all of this leave us? </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Corruption at the core</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ironically, outrage for the police’s conduct in this case has united Bostonians across political lines, with <a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2024/04/as-jurors-are-empaneled-at-karen-reads-trial-her-supporters-gather-at-a-distance.html">community activists</a> joining the likes of local conservative pundit <a href="https://wrko.iheart.com/featured/the-howie-carr-show/content/2024-06-20-1270-the-howie-carr-radio-netw-meatball-morrisseys-revenge-messages-against/">Howie Carr</a>. Meanwhile, hundreds of Read supporters traveled from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/free-karen-read-supporters-murder-trial-dedham-court/">across the country</a> to protest for her freedom outside the courthouse. They sometimes clashed with O’Keefe’s family and their supporters, who <a href="https://www.wcvb.com/article/tensions-run-high-outside-courthouse-as-jury-deliberates-karen-read-case/61456283">argue</a> Read’s defense has turned a clear case of murder into a distorted media circus and fueled unfounded accusations of conspiracy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The mistrial means that the narrative of the case has also expanded.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the one hand, popular resistance to the idea that a successful, articulate white woman could commit such a brutal murder might be fueling a good deal of the support for Read — which speaks to lots of assumptions about how we view class, privilege, and who gets to be seen as a victim. We’re accustomed, after all, to seeing women like Read in the role of the victim, no matter that she is the one on trial here. When it comes to true crime, the media <a href="https://jgrj.law.uiowa.edu/sites/jgrj.law.uiowa.edu/files/2022-11/True%20Crime%20and%20Danger%20Narratives-%20Reflections%20on%20Stories%20of%20Violence%2C%20Race%2C%20and%20%28In%29justice%20.pdf">gives more attention</a> and sympathy to attractive middle-class white women than it does to male victims, much less victims who are poor or people of color.    </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, Boston police are famously corrupt, with a long history of <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/1986/1027/abos.html">bribery</a>, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ma/pr/retired-boston-police-captain-found-guilty-overtime-fraud-scheme">fraud</a>, and <a href="https://www.wgbh.org/news/politics/2022-03-16/reforming-the-boston-police-has-been-a-hard-fought-uphill-series-of-battles-over-the-last-50-years">racial bias</a>. The Read case is being compared to another possible homicide involving a <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/06/24/metro/sandra-birchmore-death-stoughton/">horrifying allegation</a> of police conspiracy in nearby Stoughton, but this isn&#8217;t just a regional issue. American cities are frequently <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/7/26/9036859/compstat-police-corruption">beset</a> by <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/8/4/23820288/six-former-mississippi-police-offers-plead-guilty-assault">actual</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/2/16961146/baltimore-gun-trace-task-force-trial">proven</a> police <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/7/7/21293259/police-racism-violence-ideology-george-floyd">corruption</a>. Boston isn’t unique. What does feel unique is the amount of public attention and scrutiny being given to the role of potential corruption in such a high-profile trial. It all adds up to what may well be a hopelessly irreconcilable pursuit of truth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It started with a coconut tree. Sorry — actually it starts with the context of what came before.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you’re an active internet denizen, you might already know what I’m referencing: a viral clip of Vice President Kamala Harris delivering a speech while repeating a question that she says her mother often posed to her: “‘You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if you’re fortunate enough not to live online, this is your guide to catching up on all the Kamala Harris memes. Many have been percolating for months (or even longer). Now, after <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024">Biden’s disastrous debate has prompted speculation</a> he’ll drop out of the race, the memes are everywhere.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The coconut line is more than a year old: from a swearing-in ceremony that Harris led in May 2023 in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. But it’s also a stand-in for how the vice president is often perceived in pop culture, in mainstream media, and online: as a bit of a punchline, someone lacking serious power and with a perplexing political track record, and as the closest we’ll get to recreating Julia Louis-Dreyfus’s character in HBO’s <em>Veep.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Call it ironic or unironic #<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/25/20697783/khive-twitter-kamala-harris-2020-candidate-doug-hive">KHive</a> posting, being “Kamalapilled” or “coconutpilled,” or simply feeling “unburdened” (I’ll get to that in a second).  The resurgence in Harris memes is a symptom of the angst and uncertainty many Americans are feeling as the country and the Democratic Party navigate yet another crisis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, to guide you through this discourse, I’ve rounded up a few of the most popular memes, starting with the foundational one.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>“Coconut trees” and the context of what came before</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the vice president referred to her mom’s question about falling out of a coconut tree, she was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JWR29RT5sw">recounting a lesson</a> about the importance of history. Speaking to government appointees who would work on economic and education equity for Hispanic Americans, she emphasized that their task would be to aid not only young people, but also their parents, grandparents, teachers, and communities, “because none of us just live in a silo. Everything is in context.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And she <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/05/10/remarks-by-vice-president-harris-at-swearing-in-ceremony-of-commissioners-for-the-white-house-initiative-on-advancing-educational-equity-excellence-and-economic-opportunity-for-hispanics/">continued</a>:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-none is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p class="has-text-align-none">“My mother used to — she would give us a hard time sometimes, and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?’ </p>



<p class="has-text-align-none">You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the takeaway is clear enough, something that’s been said for centuries: No person is an island.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it was her delivery that turned it into a meme: in a joking voice, with exaggerated hand and arm gestures, and with a signature Kamala Harris laugh.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the time, social media users and right-wing accounts <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/fell-out-of-a-coconut-tree">accused</a> her of behaving strangely: “Obviously drunk,” one <a href="https://x.com/Rifleman4WVU/status/1656441274906320896">viral tweet</a> said, while others used clips of the speech to describe being intoxicated or inebriated (which itself is another Harris meme).</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“mr. gorbachev, tear down this coconut tree!” <a href="https://t.co/2ZvmfuUWL0">pic.twitter.com/2ZvmfuUWL0</a></p>&mdash; gregor samsung 𖢥 (@slimjosa) <a href="https://twitter.com/slimjosa/status/1808303666203697643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Being “unburdened by what has been”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around the time of the most recent return of the coconut tree clip, another of Harris’s quotes began to circulate: not a memorable one-off, but a catchphrase she uses over and over.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a <a href="https://x.com/KamalaHarris/status/1310607188566724610">go-to line</a> during her 2020 presidential primary campaign and into the general election as Biden’s running mate: “What can be, unburdened by what has been.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And thanks to a <a href="https://x.com/RNCResearch/status/1736468129528602811">Republican Party supercut</a> of all the times Harris has used the phrase in speeches, interviews, and appearances, the phrase went viral again. “Four straight minutes of ‘what can be, unburdened by what has been.’ It’s incredible. I had no idea she used it this much,” one Republican staffer <a href="https://x.com/thejcoop/status/1806867772988625316">said</a> as he reshared the clip in the aftermath of the first presidential debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The literal meaning of this catchphrase varies from speech to speech, but it’s often used in the context of Harris’s trailblazing career, marking historic firsts as a woman of color in elected office and carrying the weight of history, or as a call to arms to dream bigger and leave the past behind.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a way, this quote contradicts Harris’s coconut tree line. As one <a href="https://x.com/Sturgeons_Law/status/1807513289330450566">X user</a> put it: “How are you supposed to exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you AND be, unburdened by what has been at the same time? Waiting for her 3rd great revelation that synthesizes these two.”</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How are you supposed to exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you AND be, unburdened by what has been at the same time? Waiting for her 3rd great revelation that synthesizes these two. <a href="https://t.co/pDzyxaQdKk">https://t.co/pDzyxaQdKk</a></p>&mdash; Sturgeon&#039;s Law (@Sturgeons_Law) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sturgeons_Law/status/1807513289330450566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The “significance of the passage of time”</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Speaking at an <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?518860-1/vice-president-harris-remarks-affordable-broadband-access">event in Louisiana</a> to announce millions of dollars in funding for broadband access, Harris referenced touring a library and reflected on historical inequities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We were talking about the significance of the passage of time, right? The significance of the passage of time. When you think about it, there is a great significance in the passage of time in terms of what we need to do to lay these wires.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She repeated the phrase a few more times, as noted in a clip widely <a href="https://x.com/EndWokeness/status/1808533077271990424">shared online</a>, and especially by right-wing users in the last few days.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The wheels on the bus </strong><strong><em>do</em></strong><strong> go round and round</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When seeing her campaign tour bus for the first time in 2019 during the Democratic presidential primaries, another video of Harris being a little awkward was shared on social media.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the camera pans 180 degrees around her, she walks across a lawn and onto the bus as she giggles and sings “the wheels on the bus go round and round,” slightly <a href="https://x.com/drmistercody/status/1808229682825122190">off-key</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The vice president does impressions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More recently, clips of Harris showing another kind of less polished persona have also reappeared online: one from the ceremonial swearing-in of senators in January 2023, when <a href="https://x.com/_natemorris/status/1610652197968089088">Harris imitates</a> Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet’s deep booming voice, and another from 2019, when she <a href="https://x.com/GraduatedBen/status/1808276737005916267">imitates</a> her husband’s parents’ voices <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtAPOKDV-nY">during an interview</a> at the 92<sup>nd</sup> Street Y in New York City.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Kamala does a great Jewish mother impression <a href="https://t.co/BmWTcRqrR9">pic.twitter.com/BmWTcRqrR9</a></p>&mdash; Dr. Ben Braddock (@GraduatedBen) <a href="https://twitter.com/GraduatedBen/status/1808276737005916267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>There are plenty more</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might remember other classic Harris deliveries — or you might be encountering them for the first time:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-did-it-joe">“We did it, Joe.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/findareaction/status/1588718308060168193">“I love Venn diagrams.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/TheMemesArchive/status/1557191149424713728">“I love good news.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How she <a href="https://x.com/CapehartJ/status/1595526310335586305">seasons a turkey</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://x.com/SirajAHashmi/status/1794818668200608070">“Do not come.”</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris’s stint as vice president has often been pretty unremarkable, but it has provided a rich vein of memes, in part because she can be an awkward communicator.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s part of what fueled critical media coverage of her during the first year of her tenure, and which led the White House to largely sideline her during the first half of the Biden presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other Kamala memes are rooted in the hokey nature of a lot of modern political speech: derived from aphorisms and pseudo-philosophical diction in the hope of echoing something like former President Barack Obama’s oratory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the first female, Black, and South Asian vice president, Harris was always doomed to receive an extraordinary amount of scrutiny and bias — and emphasized her persona as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuEZcAgOQs0">“joyful warrior”</a> in part to combat some of those stereotypes. The joyful warrior, it seems, is sometimes a goofy one too. Harris delivers many of these lines in a genuinely funny way, with an affect unlike many politicians (described sometimes as just <a href="https://x.com/Chelsea_Fagan/status/1591478294444400640">vibing</a> along).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, all this talk about being KHive pilled, or coconutpilled<strong>,</strong> especially from people who were skeptical or critical of the vice president just a few weeks ago<strong> </strong>speaks to the uncertainty of this moment. Plenty of people are wondering whether Biden will still be the Democratic nominee by the end of the summer. They’re meme-ing their way to a new celebration of Harris — unburdened by what has been. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As President Joe Biden struggles to survive the political crisis that has engulfed his campaign, he’s faced two worsening trends in recent days.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, major media outlets have published several new stories raising tough questions about Biden’s age and governing capacity. The floodgates for leaks have opened, reporters are intensely scrutinizing the issue, and the president is no longer getting the benefit of the doubt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, a few Democratic elected officials have finally begun to openly discuss the prospect that Biden could leave the ticket — and some have outright called on him to do so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bulk of the Democratic Party, for now, is still behind Biden, and he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-meet-democratic-governors-seeks-tamp-calls-step-rcna160104">maintained Wednesday</a> that he’s staying in the race. But anxious deliberations within the party about what to do are continuing, particularly in the wake of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/us/politics/poll-debate-biden-trump.html">new polling</a> showing Donald Trump expanding his lead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s being reported about Biden’s age and capacity</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before the debate, major media outlets like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/04/us/politics/biden-president-age-2024.html">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-election-2024-8ee15246">Wall Street Journal</a> would intermittently report on the question of Biden’s age and health, collecting accounts of what the president is like behind closed doors from aides and others who met with him in private.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Often, such reports turned up a mixed picture, finding that Biden sometimes had mix-ups and verbal flubs and sometimes appeared fully up to the job. Always, Democrats responded to these reports with intense criticism.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the debate, though, coverage of this issue has risen to a new level of intensity — and leaks have been coming fast and furious.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A brutal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/politics/biden-lapses.html">New York Times story</a> released Tuesday dug into what the paper called Biden’s “lapses” — which their sources claimed have recently grown “more frequent, more pronounced and more worrisome.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In such lapses, the Times reporters’ sources claim, Biden would sometimes appear “listless,” “lose the thread of conversations,” or react with “blank-stared confusion.” At other points, they say, Biden would appear “perfectly on top of his game.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Axios’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/29/two-bidens-trump-debate-2024-president">Alex Thompson reported</a> that aides believed Biden was “dependably engaged” between the hours of 10 am and 4 pm — but that outside those hours, Biden was “more likely to have verbal miscues and become fatigued.” (Thompson added that aides “usually” see Biden “engaged,” and have brushed off “flashes” of absent-mindedness as “ordinary brain farts.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Legendary reporter <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4751653-carl-bernstein-biden-trump-debate-anderson-cooper-cnn/">Carl Bernstein said on CNN</a> that, over the past year and a half, “there have been 15 to 20 occasions” on which Biden has appeared as unfocused as he was during the debate. He characterized such instances as Biden losing his train of thought and being unable to “pick it up again.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/biden-age-concerns-world-leaders-democrats-6d753921">Wall Street Journal</a> reported that some senior European diplomats have said “they had tracked a noticeable deterioration in the president’s faculties in meetings since last summer.”&nbsp;And the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a881d29c-99cc-43a8-bda8-ecd9a665f7d4">Financial Times reported</a> that, during a meeting between Biden and an EU leader earlier this year, the president began and ended the meeting by telling the same anecdote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such incidents appear juicy when they come from anonymous leaks. But the reality is that many&nbsp;Biden <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/28/us/politics/biden-jackie-walorski.html">incidents</a> like this have at various points <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/second-mixup-week-biden-talks-meeting-dead-european-leaders-rcna137823">occurred</a> in public and been <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-repeats-same-story-twice-almost-word-for-word-within-minutes-sparking-concern-online-elder-abus">reported on before</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s changed is that many Biden-sympathetic observers tended to view them as uncharacteristic or unrepresentative. A common reaction was: So what if he mixes up a name or forgets something? It’s not putting his governance at risk.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the debate has changed the narrative around incidents like this — reasonably so, given the risks Biden’s poor performance there posed to his reelection. What could be waved away as harmless blips now look like a devastating chronic weakness.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Will this change anything?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though left-of-center commentators have overwhelmingly called for Biden to step aside after the debate, his support among elected Democratic officials has mostly held up so far.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But a few cracks in that support started to appear Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

Peter Welch</a> (D-VT) characterized Biden’s campaign as being far too dismissive of legitimate concerns.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/02/joe-manchin-biden-debate-democrats-drop-out/">reported</a> that Sen.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden has done little to quiet these concerns so far, having avoided unscripted public settings since the debate.

<p class="has-text-align-none">Clueless or complicit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s Ted Cruz’s take on the media’s coverage of Joe Biden’s age and mental acuity, which came under scrutiny after the president publicly unraveled in last week’s debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, the Republican senator from Texas <a href="https://x.com/tedcruz/status/1807857345000886311">tweeted to me</a>: “There are only two options: (1) the Dems &amp; their media shills were so clueless that they had no idea that Biden is mentally incompetent, or (2) they KNEW &amp; they deliberately LIED about it. Both are damning. I vote #2.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cruz isn’t the only one taking aim at the media after the debate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right-wing commentators are imagining that news outlets covered up Biden’s frailty for years. Some on the left are asserting that the White House press corps should have probed Biden’s health more closely, which could have prompted a fuller primary process. Journalists (including the one writing this column) are doing some reassessing of their own, asking if the clearly aging 81-year-old president was given the benefit of the doubt too many times.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I’m sorry, Ted Cruz, there are more than two options.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And after talking to top reporters on the White House beat, what emerges is a far more nuanced picture.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The national media wasn’t dodging the story: The biggest newspapers in the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/09/us/politics/biden-age-democrats.html">published</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/11/biden-age-2024-election/">lengthy</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-election-2024-8ee15246">stories</a> about Biden’s mental fitness. The public wasn’t in the dark about Biden’s age: Most voters (67 percent in a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/646547/age-issues-working-trump-advantage-pre-debate.aspx">June Gallup poll</a>) thought he was too old to be president even before the debate. But questions about Biden’s fitness for office were not emphasized as much as they should have been. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s the third option: The stories should have been tougher, the volume should have been louder.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The hard thing about ‘Biden is old’ as a story is that it had a dead-end quality to it,” said Charlotte Alter, senior correspondent for Time magazine. “Biden is old. We know. So now what? You can’t turn back time. You can’t make him younger.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the story is no longer a dead end. Key members of Biden’s party, spooked by the debate, are wondering whether he should remain in the race. Some are pushing for him to step aside. One of the correspondents I interviewed, who spoke on condition of anonymity because their employer prohibits outside interviews, said, “Sources are coming out of the woodwork now.” Journalists who were previously stymied by uncooperative aides are now probing whether the White House did, to some degree, cover up Biden’s condition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until now, the coverage has largely consisted of questions; hopefully soon there will be answers.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A brief history of a half-decade of Biden age coverage</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Some consider it taboo to ask whether a candidate is too old to serve as president. Not the press,” Politico’s acclaimed media critic Jack Shafer wrote in 2019. Shafer’s <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/08/02/joe-biden-age-media-227499/">column</a> — titled “Is Joe Biden Too Old?” — observed that nearly every major media outlet was zeroing in on the candidate’s age, then 76, making “his state of mental and physical fitness the primary lens through which it views his candidacy.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The scrutiny never really subsided. The New York Times’s chief White House correspondent Peter Baker told me that his first Page One <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/09/us/politics/biden-age-democrats.html">story</a> about Biden’s age was published in July 2022. “The age question is catching up to Joe Biden,” a CNN columnist <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/11/politics/joe-biden-age-democrats/index.html">wrote</a> that same month. “Biden, turning 80, faces renewed age questions as he weighs reelection,” the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/11/11/biden-age-2024-election/">wrote</a> in November 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This was critical coverage. Journalists aren’t doctors, and shouldn’t pretend to be. But they are observers, and Baker, like others on the Biden beat, reported what he observed over the years. Biden “often shuffles when he walks, and aides worry he will trip on a wire,” Baker wrote in 2022. “He stumbles over words during public events, and they hold their breath to see if he makes it to the end without a gaffe.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Back then, it was unclear whether Biden would run for a second term. Baker quoted S. Jay Olshansky, a longevity specialist at the University of Illinois Chicago, saying it was fair to ask if Biden would still be fit for office in 2028, when he would be 86 years old. “You can’t sugarcoat aging,” Olshansky said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, despite the scrutiny, some reporters are looking back and wondering what they could have done differently, particularly after Biden’s April 2023 announcement of his reelection bid raised the stakes. “That’s when the coverage should have gotten a lot tougher,” one of the beat reporters remarked to me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The White House waged war on age reporting</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To assess the quality of the media’s coverage of Biden’s age, it helps to understand what made it such a difficult story to begin with. Because it certainly is difficult.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It has been a challenge for the media to find the best way to tell this story,” Baker said. “It’s a hard topic, right? It’s subjective. It depends in part on people in the room with him telling you in a candid way what they see. And it’s certainly true that this White House is not a particularly transparent White House.&#8221;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Baker’s sentiment on the White House is widely shared. In conversations about this topic with a dozen White House correspondents and other Washington reporters, I heard harsh criticism of the Biden administration for “gaslighting” and “bullying” people who pursued stories about the president’s health — and praise for the journalists who did so anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“They really hate us over these stories,” Baker said. The administration’s “pushback is pretty strong and their resentment of the coverage is pretty deep, to the point that they’ve complained to our editors.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s press aides were inordinately sensitive, you might say defensive, about the topic. “When reporters raise age questions, they lose their minds,” one reporter said. “They go ballistic,” a second reporter said. “Every time you write about Biden’s age, they gaslight you and tell you that you’ll be responsible for the downfall of the American republic,” a third reporter said, exaggerating just a touch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Atlantic’s Mark Leibovich penned a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/06/biden-run-for-reelection-2024/661297/">column</a> in June 2022 saying that Biden was “too old for the next election.” In a February 2023 <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/02/joe-biden-2024-election-democrat-candidates/673212/">follow-up</a>, he quipped that “the White House did not like that story.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some left-leaning readers didn’t like it, either.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reader response to age coverage was punishing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In my talks with reporters, I also heard complaints about how stories on Biden’s age were received. Many Trump supporters treated it as a given that Biden was senile, and any report that didn’t outright agree was seen as part of the alleged media cover-up.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Biden supporters accused journalists of abetting Trump by “both-sidesing” an election that features an aspiring authoritarian who tried to steal the last presidential election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prominent journalists who were outspoken about voters’ age concerns, like New York Times podcasters Ezra Klein and Astead Herndon, were pummeled by partisans in social media comment threads. (“Americans have said consistently that they wanted someone else to be the nominee,” Herndon pointed out again on CNN after the debate <a href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/ip/date/2024-06-28/segment/01">last week</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The tensions are still palpable this week: Every time I appear on CNN (my old home) or the BBC to discuss the Democratic Party’s post-debate state of crisis, I get messages from liberal viewers who believe I’m helping hand the election to Trump. The former president looms over every story and TV segment about Biden, and some Washington reporters have privately griped that Biden got a bit of a free pass because Trump was so aberrant and so dishonest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the White House reporters I know weren’t slacking off or going soft on Biden because they wanted to help the Democratic Party defeat Trump. That’s just Infowars-style conspiracy thinking. Reporters live for scoops, and a scoop about Biden being debilitated would be a blockbuster. It’s just not that simple.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Witness the Wall Street Journal’s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/joe-biden-age-election-2024-8ee15246">prescient story</a> in early June — “Behind Closed Doors, Biden Shows Signs of Slipping” — which was widely criticized for leaning too heavily on Republican sources with partisan agendas. The Biden press shop went into <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/06/05/biden-age-wall-street-journal-2024-election">attack mode</a> and the Journal reporters felt rather lonely as media commentators <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/06/09/wall-street-journal-biden-slipping-article/">derided</a> the story.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The reality was that the Journal had lots of solid reporting, but too many people gave the Biden White House the benefit of the doubt. I was part of the problem; I appeared on MSNBC and said that Biden’s age could decide the election “if the media obsesses over it and ignores Trump’s faults.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s fitness for office merited more “obsessing.” His relative lack of in-depth interviews and news conferences was, in hindsight, a tell. His decision to turn down a prime spot on CBS on Super Bowl Sunday, bucking with presidential tradition, probably should have been scrutinized even more emphatically.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The evidence on Biden’s cognitive decline was often muddled</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The awkward reality is that there are “two Joe Bidens,” as Baker and several New York Times colleagues put it in a Page One <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/04/us/politics/biden-president-age-2024.html">piece</a> about “America’s oldest president” in June 2023.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To borrow a meme, that article has aged well. The notion of Biden having good days and bad days has become conventional wisdom. Perhaps the debate was his worst day yet — although reporters don’t have enough access to Biden to confidently say so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That was the worst I’ve ever seen him,” one White House correspondent told me afterward, a sentiment affirmed by three other Biden beat reporters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, down-the-middle media outlets may not have placed enough significance on the string of embarrassing video clips and other episodes. Several reporters told me that, in retrospect, apparent signs of Biden’s advancing age were treated as one-offs when they might have been something more. “Did we miss some chances to connect some dots? I think that’s a fair question,” a veteran correspondent told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On one memorable occasion, in September 2022, Biden scanned a crowd and looked for Rep. Jackie Walorski, Republican of Indiana, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/wheres-jackie-biden-seeks-lawmaker-walorski-who-died-august-2022-09-28/#:~:text=Biden%20thanked%20other%20conference%20organizers,two%20staffers%20in%20early%20August">asking</a>, “Jackie, are you here? Where’s Jackie?” Walorski had been killed in a car crash the previous month.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One “senior moment” after another led to frequent corrections of White House transcripts and thorough fact-checks by news outlets. I was particularly galled when Biden said, in remarks to service members and first responders on the anniversary of September 11, that he remembered “standing there the next day” and looking at Ground Zero. He <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/11/politics/fact-check-biden-ground-zero-next-day/index.html">didn’t visit</a> the site until nine days after the attack. I wish I had made more of that. At the time, I chalked it up to Biden being Biden.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s also how the White House tried to minimize special counsel Robert K. Hur’s embarrassing <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/08/us/biden-documents-special-counsel.html#:~:text=Hur%20portrayed%20him%20as%20unable,He%20cited%20Mr.">assessment</a> of Biden as a “sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.” When Biden delivered an angry rebuttal to Hur’s report, he <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/4457527-biden-mistakenly-calls-egyptian-leader-president-of-mexico/">mixed up</a> the presidents of Egypt and Mexico — yet another one of those dots that could have been connected more assertively. Several beat reporters told me they thought the White House largely succeeded in framing Hur as a Republican smear artist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If Biden had a “bad day” with Hur, he also had lots of “good days,” and members of the media dutifully described those, in quotes that have come under newfound scrutiny. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, a personal friend of Biden’s, said in March that he’d recently “spent a couple of hours with Joe Biden” and found him to be “better than he’s ever been intellectually.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Anti-Biden media outlets have ridiculed Scarborough for praising Biden’s intellect, but the assessment is entirely in line with the experience many people have with elderly relatives: sharp one day, slow the next day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, Biden biographer Evan Osnos <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/03/11/joe-biden-profile#:~:text=For%20better%20and%20worse%2C%20he,a%20name%20or%20a%20date.">wrote</a> in the New Yorker that when he last interviewed Biden, in January, “his mind seemed unchanged. He never bungled a name or a date.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Immediately after the debate, Osnos said Biden was clearly diminished. He told me, of the article he published in March, “The piece was about Biden’s defiant belief that he could and should win. His job was to persuade Americans to agree with him, and that has failed.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until the debate, Biden’s highest-profile television appearance of the year was his State of the Union address in March. He won high marks for a commanding, even feisty speech; he was so high-energy that Fox types claimed he was “jacked up” on stimulants or illicit substances. But he was using a teleprompter and speaking in front of a crowd, two features that last week’s CNN debate lacked.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The triumphant nature of Biden’s State of the Union address enabled White House aides, and Biden-friendly media outlets, to dismiss his mental misfires and physical deterioration. For a long time, “they did an incredibly effective job of bubble wrapping him,” a DC anchor told me. It worked, sometimes, with some audiences.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not working anymore. The bubble wrap is off.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So did the media get this one wrong?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I know many readers would love an easy answer here, and I know many pundits are eager to provide one. But it’s just not that simple.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For starters, there’s no such thing as “the media” anymore. We live in a time of such complete and utter mass-media fragmentation that we each live in a media bubble of our own making. In mine, Biden might be a wise leader who is making America sane again after four years of Trump insanity; in yours, he might be a doddering old fool or a victim of “elder abuse,” as Fox hosts are now openly saying.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And even if you narrow the media-criticism conversation down to a handful of high-profile, down-the-middle national outlets, the record of how effectively Biden’s health was covered is complicated, just as aging is a complicated process. Baker, who co-bylined a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/02/us/politics/biden-lapses.html">new story</a> on Tuesday titled “Biden’s Lapses Are Said to Be Increasingly Common and Worrisome,” told me, “It’s very likely that things have progressed in recent weeks and months that make this a more acute story now.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout Biden’s years in office, reporters sought to avoid ageist stereotypes and respect the fact that Biden has a history of stuttering while also reporting on what they were observing. They also weighed his verbal gaffes and viral video blunders against his political victories. Baker and several other reporters wrote in the June 2023 “America’s Oldest President” story that Biden was, in truth, “somewhere between the partisan cartoon of an addled and easily manipulated fogy promoted by Republicans and the image spread by his staff of a president in aviator shades commanding the world stage and governing with vigor.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, about those Republicans. Fox News stars have been taking a victory lap this week, having spent years and countless segments portraying Biden as incompetent and incapacitated. They feel like they deserve credit for being early to the story that’s now consuming Washington.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Fox supplied precious little actual reporting on the subject of Biden’s health. Instead, hosts like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham queued up video clips of Biden looking helpless and played those clips on a loop, devoid of any context or balance. When Biden would deliver a forceful speech, as on State of the Union night, Fox’s commentators seemed caught off guard.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consider the recent controversies over so-called “cheapfake” videos of Biden. He really has, at times, appeared to wander off and freeze up in front of cameras. But some of the videos hyped by Biden critics were misleading, even maliciously so.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Pro-Trump media outlets took a clip of Biden pausing before sitting down in a chair and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-biden-invisible-chair-normandy-634944982428">claimed</a> that there was no chair there at all. Online meme makers <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-video-shows-joe-biden-did-notin-factpoop-himself-at-d-day-event">imagined</a> that he was defecating during a D-Day ceremony.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those types of lies caused at least a little bit of hesitation among good-faith reporters. As one said to me, “I didn’t want to feed into a bad-faith caricature.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the answer to bad-faith attacks can’t be a supine press, and journalists have a chance now to prove they’re up to the task of reporting this story. The public deserves to know more about Biden’s health, and it is owed more insight into how the president is functioning in the White House.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We live in the era of a gerontocracy. Were Trump to win, he’d be 82 at the end of his second term —&nbsp;older than Biden is now. “The Biden-is-old story is a small piece of a bigger story, which is that our entire government is really old, across all branches,” said Alter, who wrote the 2020 book <em><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/598359/the-ones-weve-been-waiting-for-by-charlotte-alter/">The Ones We’ve Been Waiting For: How a New Generation of Leaders Will Transform America</a>.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That new generation is still waiting for its turn. So questions of age will come up over and over again. Reporters who push past hostile press offices and recalcitrant readers to get to the facts will have met the moment —&nbsp;and delivered to the public what it deserves.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Micah Pollak had no idea the trouble he was getting himself into when he shared his preferred thermostat settings on social media. “I just discovered most of our friends set their AC at 68-73F during the summer,” Micah, who is an economist at Indiana University, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@micah.pollak/post/C80c91XMRBp">posted on Threads</a> in late June. “We keep ours at 77-78F. Are we monsters!?” Nearly a thousand replies later, the consensus was that, yes, Micah’s family are monsters, probably some type of lizard.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although he didn’t realize it, Micah has been following a set of numbers from the Environmental Protection Agency that <a href="https://x.com/gorgeousbrains/status/1803936205559431535">tends to spark an internet freakout</a> every summer, often after a local news station <a href="https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/the-coolest-you-should-keep-your-house-is-78-degrees-federal-program-recommends/509-1f1bc1e1-e5ea-4f8a-8068-c8b7ba463dbc">does a segment</a> on how to reduce your energy consumption and lower your utility bills. The recommendations include keeping your thermostat at 78º when you’re at home during the day, 82º at night, and 85º when you’re away during the warm months. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To many people, sleeping in 82º heat is simply outrageous. (Not to mention <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-is-the-ideal-sleeping-temperature-for-my-bedroom">terrible for your sleep</a>, according to experts.) But energy prices are crazy too, and they’re only expected to rise as utility companies <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-09/interest-rate-cuts-unlikely-to-lower-energy-costs-for-americans?embedded-checkout=true">spend more and more</a> to make the grid more resilient to the effects of climate change. Extreme weather events are becoming more common, and heat waves in particular <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23893057/power-electricity-grid-heat-wave-record-blackout-outage-climate">can strain the power grid</a>, especially when thousands of people are running their ACs at full tilt.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So maybe cranking up your thermostat isn’t such a bad deal. Typically, I’m inclined to set my AC to 72 on a really hot day. If I could get used to a balmy 78º inside, I’d not only save money, I’d be doing my part to keep the grid running smoothly so that everyone can enjoy a little bit of air conditioning, too. And the savings are real. The EPA says that for every degree warmer you set your AC, you can save 6 percent on your cooling costs, although you get diminishing returns as you go higher and higher. Put simply, if your cooling bill is usually $170, setting your thermostat a single digit higher will save you over $10 a month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s one big problem, though. That 78º baseline isn’t a real federal government recommendation. The EPA’s Energy Star program does have a guide for programmable thermostat settings, but it doesn’t recommend a specific number to set your thermostat to in the summer. The numbers that show up in the news actually come from <a href="https://www.energystar.gov/sites/default/files/asset/document/HeatingCoolingGuide%20FINAL_9-4-09_0.pdf">a table in a 2009 document</a> that offered examples of what energy-saving settings could look like. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Your household temperatures are very much a personal choice, and ultimately people should do what makes them comfortable,” Leslie Jones, a public affairs specialist from Energy Star, told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The agency’s official position <a href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/programmable-thermostats">is that you can save</a> “up to 10 percent on heating and cooling settings by simply turning your thermostat 7°-10°F for 8 hours a day from its normal setting.” In other words, if you keep it at 71 while you’re home, go ahead and set it to 78 if you leave for the day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then again, setting your thermostat at 78√ at all times is not a monstrous idea. And setting it at 72º probably means you’re wasting some energy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nobody wants the government telling them to suffer more in the summer heat. A lot of our assumptions, though, about how air conditioning works, how to optimize the effectiveness of this century-old technology, and how to save energy in the process are just that: assumptions. To clear up the outrage over where we set out thermostats, I talked to experts in thermal comfort, HVAC technology, and the built environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It turns out, some of the most effective ways to stay cool are both simple and cheap.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Why we fight over the thermostat</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a time-honored American tradition to fight over the thermostat. Winter, summer, spring, and fall, any given home will be too hot or too cold for someone in the family.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is for good reason, too. Physiologically, we each have our own optimal thermal comfort level. It comes down to a few key factors, according to <a href="https://www.tno.nl/en/about-tno/our-people/boris-kingma/">Boris Kingma</a>, a human thermal performance researcher at the Netherlands Institute of Applied Technology (TNO). The environment, including temperature, humidity, wind, and solar radiation, is obviously the big one. If it’s hot outside, you’ll feel hot. But a person’s metabolic rate and general physiology, including age and overall health, also play a big role — as does the clothing you’re wearing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Metabolism is what’s at play when you talk to people who say they “run hot.” They might literally do that if they have a high metabolism, which causes your body to produce more heat. People with more muscle mass, for instance, tend to have higher metabolisms, retain heat, and prefer cooler temperatures. The opposite goes for people with lower metabolisms, who <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541107/">lose heat</a> and might need to wear a sweater in their over-air-conditioned office. Our metabolisms decrease with age, which might be why you think your grandparents keep their house too warm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is therefore difficult, if not impossible, to find a single thermostat setting that will make all of America happy. Heck, it’s hard enough to agree on anything in a single family. But the good news is that our bodies are very good at acclimating to new environments. Kingma told me that it only takes about 14 days for your body to adjust to a new baseline temperature. So if you’re used to New York City’s relatively mild summer average of 80°F and then move to Miami, where it’s closer to 90°, you’ll probably get used to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The same holds for thermostat settings. If you do try and save some money by moving your thermostat one digit up, your body will adjust in a couple weeks, especially if you use a fan and wear lightweight clothing inside. Fans are especially effective, since they move air around your skin, helping sweat evaporate. Loose clothing has the same effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Many of the solutions to this particular problem don’t need to be high tech,” said Kingma. “Dealing with temperature is about as old as humans.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The role of evaporation cannot be overstated here. Sweating cools us down because the fluid on our skin evaporates and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30454591/">helps us shed heat</a>. This explains why humidity is so miserable: The air is already so saturated with moisture that your sweat doesn’t evaporate effectively, which means you don’t cool down as easily. On windy days or in dry climates — a dry heat, if you will — sweat evaporates more readily, making it easier to stay cool. Fans can help in either scenario.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Focusing on reducing humidity is actually how we got air conditioning in the first place. In 1902, an engineer named Willis Carrier installed an “<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US808897A/en">apparatus for treating air</a>” at a printing company in Brooklyn that was having problems with magazine pages wrinkling in the summer heat. The machine sent air through coils filled with cold water, which removed humidity from the air and cooled the room. It wasn’t until 1922 that the Carrier Air Conditioning Company of America introduced the first practical centrifugal refrigeration compressor that <a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/nmah_846092">would become the foundation</a> for modern air conditioners.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most AC units today do the job with three simple steps. They pull warm air out of the room, cool it down by running it over coils filled with refrigerants, and then pump the cold air back into the room while releasing the heat to the outside world by using a compressor, which is why your AC can sound like a starting car. Heat pumps, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/heat-pumps-explained">which can heat and cool a home</a>, operate using the same principles when cooling — more on that in a minute.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div><div><iframe title="Why heaters are the future of cooling" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIulbHyK0bc?rel=0" allowfullscreen allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></div></div>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Air conditioning is an energy-intensive process, and the refrigerants used in them present a few problems of their own. The most common refrigerants needed to make these machines work include chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HCFCs), commonly known as “freon,” which are greenhouse gasses that deplete the ozone and contribute to climate change. The EPA has been banning many of these chemicals <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ods-phaseout/homeowners-and-consumers-frequently-asked-questions">in recent decades</a> to comply with <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22686105/future-of-life-ozone-hole-environmental-crisis-united-nations-cfcs">the Montreal Protocol on Substances Depleting the Ozone Layer</a>. However, many modern replacements that do not damage the ozone are still potent greenhouse gasses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, air conditioning has historically been great for comfort but bad for the climate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not only do they require a lot of energy, which may or may not be supplied by fossil fuels, but most air conditioners also pump more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. ACs can keep us cool, but they’ll also warm the planet in the process. <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/23067049/heat-wave-air-conditioning-cooling-india-climate-change">It’s a real paradox</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Technologies like heat pumps promise a greener future for heating and cooling, but it will take years to update our HVAC infrastructure due to the cost and sheer scale of trading old, inefficient equipment with new systems. And for many, including renters and certain businesses, those upgrades may even be impossible. So for now, the fight over the thermostat continues.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The futile effort to make everyone comfortable</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no magical thermostat number to make everyone happy and maximize energy savings. For some, like Micah, the economist, 78º during the day is just fine. For others, 68º is perfect. There have been attempts to solve this problem on an institutional level. And if you’ve ever spent a hot summer day in a large office building, you know that some of those attempts have failed. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The big difference between setting a thermostat at work and at home, of course, is that you typically don’t have any control over the office thermostat. A look at how offices attempt to make everyone comfortable does, however, provide some insight into how we make decisions at home.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First formed as the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers, ASHRAE sets the industry standards for all things HVAC-related. One specific standard, ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55, provides guidance on how to optimize thermal comfort in the built environment. That includes adapting temperature, humidity, air movement, and thermal radiation in an occupied space to the activity and clothing of the people occupying it. If you’re building a business and want to figure out how to make everyone inside the office comfortable, this is the guide.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">ASHRAE, unlike the EPA, specifies an ideal number to set a building’s thermostat to. It’s a range, actually: around 23°-26°C, or 73.4°-78.8°F, in the summer. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/are-women-colder-than-men-the-science-behind-office-temperature-wars-11594373401">According to Bjarne Olesen</a>, a former ASHRAE president, “At least 80 percent of men and women are satisfied in that range.” Some might say that the upper end of that range is a bit too warm for good productivity. That assumption would line up with <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463921000225">a 2021 review</a> of scientific studies about temperature and work performance, which found the optimal temperature is between 22°-24°C, or 71.6°-75.2°F. But again, the number on the thermostat is not the only thing to consider.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even fancy office buildings are not immune to energy costs. While the EPA suggests that a single digit, or setpoint, higher on the thermostat can add up to 6 percent savings on your cooling bill, the savings are magnified if you scale them up to an entire building or even an entire city. A 2023 study of three decades of weather and energy cost data concluded that a single setpoint change coupled with behavioral changes <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ad0a56/pdf">could result in 20 percent energy savings</a>. Behavioral changes, which include everything from using fans in addition to AC and wearing lighter clothing, are especially essential in cities, which are designed to depend on air conditioning.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The technology of cool air allowed people to design buildings that would not normally be comfortable in our environment,” said Robert Bean, a fellow and lecturer at ASHRAE. “And as this environment changes, it puts us in a tough spot.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There have been some high-profile experiments in thermostat tweaks and energy savings. In 2005, Yuriko Koike, who was Japan’s environment minister at the time, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna8046182">launched an initiative called Cool Biz</a> that pushed government offices to turn their thermostats up to 82ºF from May to September to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As an incentive of sorts, workers were allowed to ditch their formal office attire — suits and ties, for instance — in favor of lighter, more casual attire, like aloha shirts and linen pants. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna8046182">There were fashion shows and everything</a>. Big corporations followed the government’s lead, and within a couple years, Cool Biz <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118947740601523458">was a national pastime</a>. By 2023, some 86 percent of workplaces <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/24/business/japan-cool-biz.html">participated in the initiative</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When it comes to energy savings, turning the thermostat up works, too. Estimates vary, but Cool Biz reportedly saves Japan <a href="https://www.env.go.jp/en/press/2005/1028a.html">between 1</a> and <a href="http://www.demand.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/demand-insight-17-V3.pdf">3 million tons</a> of carbon dioxide emissions every year. The program became even more significant in the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, when reactors across the country shut down and the government mandated further energy savings. They <a href="https://www.nebb.org/blog/cool-biz-energy-conservation-efforts-in-japan/">called it Super Cool Biz</a>. There’s even an initiative to turn thermostats down during the winter months. And yes, it is called Warm Biz.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s not rocket science,” said Kingma, the Dutch researcher. “As long as you have the ability to adapt, the problem may be solved by actually adapting.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not everybody in Japan loves this, of course. And there is research that shows productivity <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/sunday-review/air-conditioning-is-an-environmental-quandary.html">starts to dip</a> once the temperature rises to 77°F. But Japan’s example shows that an entire nation can adapt to different indoor temperatures for the greater good — and they can look good while they do it. Maybe the rest of the world can, too.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How to stay cool and save the planet</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let me make a confession: I like the thermostat set at 72. If it’s 72 or less outside, I’ll open a window and enjoy the breeze. If it’s warmer, I seal myself into my Brooklyn apartment, let the AC do the work, and wait for nightfall.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or at least, that’s what I used to do. I actually stopped setting my thermostat at 72 while reporting this story. After my conversations with thermal comfort researchers and HVAC professionals, I realized that cranking up the AC unnecessarily isn’t just a waste of energy, it’s not that comfortable either. It’s silly to get goosebumps inside in the middle of a July day because your cooling machine has cooled the room down too much. That’s why I started to heed the advice of the experts. And let me tell you, these experts are fans of fans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stefano Schiavon, a professor at the University of California Berkeley and a member of ASHRAE, told me his colleagues stick with a “fans first” strategy to cooling. “If you feel hot,” he said, “the first thing you turn on is a fan.” You can also use fans to supplement your AC, especially if you’re trying to stay comfortable at a high setpoint. Wearing loose clothing will only add to the cool enjoyment of it all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s been a movement — arguably driven by the air conditioning industry — to say the fan is a technology of the past, we don&#8217;t want them,” Schiavon explained. “But fans cost much less to manufacture, they use a small fraction of the energy, and they&#8217;re very intuitive to people so people know how to use them.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also less obvious strategies to stay cool and save energy. Running your dishwasher and doing laundry at night cuts down on bringing excess heat into the home. You can also try spending time in the rooms of your house or apartment furthest from the sun, like on the northern side of the building or in a basement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maintenance also plays a big role in making sure everything is running at peak efficiency. That means cleaning your air conditioner vents and changing filters regularly. You should also be sure to keep cool air in and hot air out, so be careful about opening windows and doors unless you’re doing so to ventilate the space.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Smart thermostats are another promising solution, although they don’t <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/when-a-smart-thermostat-isnt-the-smart-choice/">necessarily</a> work in older homes with radiators or window units. If you have central AC, you can swap out the thermostat on your wall with an internet-connected thermostat that <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/thermostats/are-smart-thermostats-worth-it-a7822875275/">lets you control everything with an app</a>. You set the system up to automatically change settings at certain times of day or optimize their performance to save energy. Good ones cost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-thermostat/">about $250</a>, but Amazon sells a basic one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22791333/amazon-smart-thermostat-review-learning-geofencing-hunches">for $80</a>. If you have a window unit, you <a href="https://gizmodo.com.au/2023/01/smart-air-conditioner-guide/">can upgrade it with a smart AC controller</a> that adds connectivity. Your utility company may even <a href="https://www.coned.com/en/save-money/rebates-incentives-tax-credits/rebates-incentives-tax-credits-for-residential-customers/bring-your-thermostat-and-get-$85">help you pay for</a> one of these devices.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You also shouldn’t sleep on the heat pump trend. Again, heat pumps operate on the same principle as an air conditioner for cooling: They use electricity and refrigerants to pull humidity and heat out of the air. They tend to be <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/hvac/heat-pump-vs-ac">as efficient as ACs</a>, too, so don’t expect your summer bills to drop if you make the switch. But by moving heat from one place to another rather than actually generating it, heat pumps are much more efficient when it comes to heating buildings. The Department of Energy says that heat pumps <a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/reviews/hvac/heat-pump-vs-ac">use up to 65 percent less electricity</a> than old fashioned furnaces or baseboard heaters. You <a href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/23498215/ev-tax-credit-2023-heat-pumps-solar">can also get a tax break</a> for installing one in your home.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s no wrong way to save energy,” said Jones from Energy Star. “It&#8217;s just a matter of figuring out what is appropriate and right for you given your situation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s possible that some magical new invention could come along and change the way we stay cool. One promising technology involves installing radiant panels filled with cold water that effectively <a href="https://engineering.princeton.edu/news/2020/09/09/multiple-benefits-world-without-air-conditioning">pull heat off of people as they pass by them</a> without actually cooling the air. Researchers at Princeton showed off a system like this in Singapore in 2019. They called it a Cold Tube, and people who walked through it reported feeling cool, even though the temperature of the air didn’t actually change. This type of technology is decades away from becoming mainstream, but it’s proof that a future without air conditioning is possible.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But for the futuristic AC-free technology to work well, guess what’s required? Fans.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For over a century, the internal combustion engine has powered vehicles with an intricate combination of moving parts and tiny explosions. That combustion process inevitably made noise, and that noise came to define the background soundscape of our roads, cities, and day-to-day life. But as hybrids and EVs have become increasingly mainstream — and more of their near-silent electric motors filled the streets — it’s clear that silent vehicles don’t fit in the ecosystem we’d built around cars.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After efforts spearheaded by associations of the blind and visually impaired, legislation eventually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/business/electric-vehicle-noises-nhtsa.html">began to require</a> electric vehicles to emit an artificial engine noise from hidden external speakers. These hidden speaker systems, called “Acoustic Vehicle Alerting Systems” — or AVAS — had to meet certain sonic criteria. But they were also a blank slate for sound designers to decide how the cars of the future should sound.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It was a significant victory that follows Biles stepping away from the sport for <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46341233/simone-biles-mental-health-therapy-anxiety-medication/">two years</a> after her early exit from the team competition in Tokyo, <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/simone-biles-withdraws-from-women-s-all-around-final" data-type="link" data-id="https://olympics.com/en/news/simone-biles-withdraws-from-women-s-all-around-final">when she cited the need to “focus on her mental health.”</a> It’s a testament, too, to the work she’s done since that contest to strengthen her mental well-being and resume a grueling physical training regimen. At the trials, Biles used her win to highlight the immense pressure that elite athletes are under and the importance of being candid about these challenges.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We’ve all been pretty open and honest [about] what we’re going through,” Biles, 27, said at a press conference following the meet. “But we’re always going to prioritize mental health and it’s really nice that Tokyo gave us that opportunity to open up that stage for that talk.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biles’s recent win marks the third time she’ll head to the Olympics and also makes her the oldest US woman gymnast to qualify for the Games since the 1950s. That Biles is resuming competition once more is a feat in and of itself. She’ll be one of a small group of gymnasts who’s ever participated in three consecutive Olympic Games. Her willingness to confront her mental health struggles also sends a compelling message, normalizing the decision to speak out and showing how athletes can be stronger for doing so.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Biles’s dominant performance at the Olympic trials, briefly explained </h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biles made her Olympic debut in Rio in 2016, where she won three individual gold medals and a team gold. Since then, she’s also won countless other competitions, including the US national championships <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/simone-biles-wins-9th-us-gymnastics-championship/story?id=110767892#:~:text=Simone%20Biles%20dominated%20at%20the,Paris%20Olympic%20Games%20this%20summer.&amp;text=The%2027%2Dyear%2Dold%20finished,%2C%20balance%20beam%2C%20and%20vault.">nine times</a>. Biles is widely regarded as the greatest gymnast of all time because of the heightened difficulty of the skills she performs and her ability to execute them. Her wins at the Olympics and numerous world championships <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/06/1204379375/simone-biles-most-decorated-gymnast-history">also make her the most decorated gymnast</a> ever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Tokyo in 2021, Biles returned to the Olympics as a member of the US team. While there, she experienced what’s colloquially known as the “twisties,” a dangerous condition when gymnasts lose the sense of where they are in the air. Given the complexity and difficulty of gymnastic routines, the twisties are extremely hazardous and can result in serious injury. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After getting the “twisties” on a vault, Biles opted to withdraw from multiple competitions at the Olympics, including the team contest. Prior to that decision, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/simonebiles/p/CRxsq_kBZrP/?img_index=1" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.instagram.com/simonebiles/p/CRxsq_kBZrP/?img_index=1">she wrote in an Instagram post</a> that she felt like she had the “weight of the world on my shoulders at times,” later describing the challenges as the build-up of longstanding traumas that all came to a head.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s like compressing all of this shit for so many years. It just unfolded. You can’t compress trauma that much longer,” Biles said this year on the<em> </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHRCJwSds1U">podcast <em>Call Her Daddy</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the years since Tokyo, Biles has said she was “petrified” to get back in the gym and revisit some of the skills she used to do. She’s described engaging in therapy as a major factor in helping her process and recover from the 2020 Olympics, and she’s also <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46341233/simone-biles-mental-health-therapy-anxiety-medication/">talked about taking medication in order to combat anxiety.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“[I’m] continuing to work on my body and my mind, just like I have the past year and a half, and it’s worked,” Biles said on <em>Call Her Daddy</em>. “I didn’t think therapy was going to work, and it’s working.” According to her coach Cecile Landi, Biles also now has a toolkit she’s built of techniques to combat stress during competitions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biles made a dominant return to this year’s Olympic trials, which consist of two days of competition, with each athlete doing all four gymnastics apparatuses — bars, beam, floor, and vault — on both days. The Olympic selection committee then considers the scores the athletes have received as well as other factors to determine who should make the team. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This year, the decision was relatively straightforward: The committee went with the top-scoring athletes across the board, something they don’t always do because they also consider individual strengths on different apparatuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the end, Biles led <a href="https://thegymter.net/2024/06/30/2024-u-s-olympic-trials-results/">with 117.225 points</a> — five points ahead of the next competitor. She was followed by Olympic vets Suni Lee at 111.675, Jordan Chiles at 111.425, Jade Carey at 111.350, and newcomer Hezly Rivera at 111.150. The five of them are the team that’s heading to Paris, while Joscelyn Roberson and Leanne Wong will serve as traveling alternates. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biles secured her spot on the Olympic team with two days of stellar routines, particularly on floor and vault. On these two apparatuses, she’s long been known for having some of the highest difficulty scores of any gymnast competing, something that hasn’t changed in her return. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her floor exercise, for example, included a jaw-dropping move <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/06/29/simone-biles-us-olympic-gymnastics-trials/74252515007/">dubbed the Biles II</a>, which involves three twists and two flips. And her vault, widely viewed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2023/09/29/simone-biles-vault-yurchenko-double-pike-difficulty/">as the toughest in women’s gymnastics</a> — featured what’s known as a Yurchenko double pike, something no other female gymnast has been able to do. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">Biles’s focus on mental health sends an important message</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since her experience in Tokyo, Biles has been vocal about the need to care for her mental health and the need for professional athletes who’ve long dealt with intense scrutiny and stress to have outlets to discuss them. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think now athletes are a little bit more in tune and we trust what our gut is saying, and just taking mental health a little bit more serious,” Biles said at this week’s press briefing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elite athletes are under incredible strain to perform, <a href="https://news.asu.edu/20231102-mental-health-and-pressure-perform">making them more prone to anxiety, depression</a>, and other mental health conditions. In the past, discussing mental health has also been stigmatized and viewed by some as a sign of weakness. Biles’s decision to speak out helps dispel some of that stigma and allows more people, including her teammates, to share their own concerns. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Suni [Lee] earlier, she came up to me and she was like ‘I’m not okay,’ and so we walk through it. We tell her, her why, why she’s doing it, and we just give her those reminders that she can do it, she’s done it before, so let’s go out there and get it,” Biles said at the press briefing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lee, too, has emphasized how important her mental health and staying positive has been as she’s navigated recovery from kidney disease in order to compete again this year. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biles has also said she’s focused less on external judgment. In Tokyo, some viewers reacted negatively to Biles’s decision to pull out of competition, and if athletes — including her — make similar decisions in Paris, it’s possible it could engender that same response from certain observers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think it has to be for us, because it can’t be for anybody else because that’s not why we do it. We do it for ourselves, and the love for this sport, and the love for representing the US,” Biles said in the press briefing. </p>

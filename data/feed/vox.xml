<p class="has-text-align-none">No less an authority than Vladimir Putin has predicted that the coming years in global affairs will be a “<a href="https://www.gmfus.org/news/putins-revolution-and-war-historical-crossroads">revolutionary situation</a>”: a reference to a <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/csi/ii.htm">line of Vladimir Lenin’s from 1913</a>, just prior to World War I. Putin’s counterpart Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/10/13/vladimir-putins-spies-are-plotting-global-chaos">concurs</a>, foreseeing “changes the likes of which we haven’t seen for 100 years.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t mean World War III is inevitable or even likely. But it does mean we are in an era when the decisions of major leaders in moments of crisis could have an outsize impact on global security and the lives of millions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This also is the moment when Donald Trump may return to the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The year 2016, when Trump was elected the first — and so far only — time, didn’t exactly feel like a very peaceful or stable moment in world history. The Syrian civil war and the US-led campaign against ISIS <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/timeline-us-policy-isis">were raging</a>. In June, one of the terror group’s sympathizers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/06/16/482322488/orlando-shooting-what-happened-update">killed 49 people </a>at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Russian-backed forces were occupying much of Eastern Ukraine and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/28/495747649/flight-mh17-was-shot-down-by-missile-moved-from-russia-investigators-say">shot down a Malaysian airliner</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About a month before the election, North Korea conducted its <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/08/asia/north-korea-seismic-activity/">most powerful nuclear test</a> to date. Europe was still in the midst of an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911">unprecedented influx of migrants</a> from the Middle East and Africa, which would end up having dramatic political consequences in several countries. Ted Cruz was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/happened-ted-cruz-told-year-girl-worlds-fire/story?id=29673686">terrifying 3-year-olds</a> on the campaign trail by telling them the world was “on fire.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, viewed from the vantage point of this year, 2016 feels like a simpler time. Wars of all types have gotten <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/25/24049551/war-increasing-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ethiopia">more common and deadlier</a> around the world in the years since, and superpower conflict — a concern that had largely receded in the post-Cold War era — is back on the agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In short, the global situation Trump would inherit if he were elected this time around would be far more dangerous and unpredictable. And that in turn raises the risks of his erratic and transactional approach to foreign policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What was, eight years ago, a localized “gray zone” conflict in Eastern Ukraine is now the first major land war in Europe in decades, one in which Russia’s president has repeatedly <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear">threatened to use nuclear weapons</a>. Israel’s war in Gaza, already one of the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/2024-08-14/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-death-toll-in-gaza-is-bad-even-compared-to-the-wars-in-ukraine-iraq-and-myanmar/00000191-50c6-d6a2-a7dd-d1decf340000">deadliest conflicts for civilians</a> of the 20th century, is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/364148/haniyeh-iran-israel-hamas-hezbollah">fast spiraling into a regional conflict</a> that could involve direct combat between Israel and Iran and could yet drag in the US military.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Further east, potentially even more dangerous conflicts loom. Many North Korea watchers believe the country is <a href="https://www.38north.org/2024/01/is-kim-jong-un-preparing-for-war/">preparing for war</a>, and that the risk of all-out conflict on the Korean peninsula — which <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/7/16974772/north-korea-war-trump-kim-nuclear-weapon">could potentially kill more than a million people</a>, even if North Korea doesn’t use its nuclear arsenal — has never been higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s Taiwan. Even putting aside a death toll on both sides that could <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/ac08ba446e8ca4c4285b79969439856a1">dwarf the war in Ukraine</a>, a war in Taiwan would be a <a href="https://rhg.com/research/taiwan-economic-disruptions/">body blow to the global economy</a>. If the US came to Taiwan’s aid, it could lose <a href="https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/230109_Cancian_FirstBattle_NextWar.pdf?VersionId=WdEUwJYWIySMPIr3ivhFolxC_gZQuSOQ">as many troops in a matter of weeks</a> as it did in 20 years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some analysts believe China could even <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/Thomas_Shugart_Testimony.pdf">preemptively attack US bases</a> in the Pacific if it believed US intervention was inevitable, something the US military has not experienced since WWII. And the threat of nuclear weapons use would loom over the conflict: China has the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal, <a href="http://authory.com/JoshuaKeating/Chinas-plan-to-be-the-next-nuclear-superpower-ada094a58e6db44acad90284fc2d087d4">one that is growing fast</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran — a group <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/axis-upheaval-russia-iran-north-korea-taylor-fontaine">some have dubbed</a> the “axis of upheaval” — may not have much in common in terms of ideology of overall interests, but are increasingly collaborating: The reported presence of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/north-korea-russia-military-ukraine.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">just the latest example</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is to downplay the wars and security threats that existed in 2016 and continued through Trump’s presidency, nor the obviously massive disruptive effect of the Covid pandemic. But state vs. state conflict, and even superpower vs. superpower conflict, is an entirely different matter than war against terrorist groups. Gray zone conflict is a different matter than open warfare. Recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24107959/replicator-drones-china-taiwan-ukraine-pentagon">rapid advances in drone technology</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24151437/ai-israel-gaza-war-hamas-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> are likely to make the wars of the future all the more unpredictable, and potentially more destructive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of which makes the idea of putting back in the Oval Office a president who <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/10/23/ambiguity-or-madness-where-harris-and-trump-stand-on-china">proudly calls</a> his foreign policy approach “crazy” so dangerous.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>A world on fire</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even putting aside the issues of Trump’s temperament, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/15/how-big-problem-is-mental-acuity-trump/">mental acuity</a>, or the warnings from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/10/the-generals-warning/680279/">senior</a><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/world/video/the-lead-israel-hamas-middle-east-2024-election-donald-trump-fasciscm"> national security</a> <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/mattis-told-woodward-he-agreed-trump">officials</a> from his own past administration that they believe he is dangerously unqualified for the presidency, there are several reasons to believe that a new Trump presidency would amplify this “revolutionary situation” rather than moderate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, Trump does not put much value in the idea of territorial integrity. It may sound like a wonky academic point, but we tend to take for granted that in our current era, <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/aba6c9c34b4b34f9498e48f63f97e04de">countries rarely conquer each other and borders are rarely changed by force</a>. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has obviously <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/ukraine-russia-war-return-conquest">challenged this taboo</a> against what the <a href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/purposes-and-principles-un-chapter-i-un-charter#:~:text=Article%202%20(4)%20of%20the,political%20independence%20of%20other%20States.">UN Charter calls </a>the “threat or use of force against the territorial integrity” of other countries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As president, Trump <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertonardelli/trump-russia-crimea">reportedly told other world leaders</a> that the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014, is rightfully Russian because everyone there speaks Russian. Figures close to the Trump campaign like <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tucker-carlson-ukraine-war-crimea-russia-state-tv-1776696">Tucker Carlson</a> and <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1576969255031296000?lang=en">Elon Musk</a> have openly endorsed the view that Crimea is rightfully Russian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump overturned decades of US policy and international consensus by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-made-golan-heights-decision-after-a-quick-history-lesson-idUSKCN1RJ01O/">he has described</a> as a snap decision made after a quick history lesson from his ambassador to Israel and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. He <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/12/trump-morocco-western-sahara-israel.html">did the same</a> for Morocco’s claims over the disputed region of Western Sahara, in return for Morocco recognizing Israel. (In fairness, the Biden administration hasn’t reversed either of these moves — once the taboo is broken, it’s hard to reestablish.) For Trump, the president who after all, mused about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-eyes-a-new-real-estate-purchase-greenland-11565904223">buying Greenland</a>, sovereignty and territorial integrity are like anything else in a deal: negotiable. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, Trump doesn’t value alliances. One reason why Russia has not attacked any of the countries bordering Ukraine, even as weapons flow into Ukraine from those countries, is that they are members of NATO, meaning that an attack on them could bring a military response from the alliance as a whole. It’s proof of concept for the most powerful military alliance in history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump tends to take a narrowly transactional view of alliances. His antipathy to NATO and threats to pull the US out of the alliance <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360160/nato-summit-allies-trump-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine">have been well-documented</a>, as have his comments that treat the US defense of Asian partners like <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/15/trump-asks-tokyo-quadruple-payments-us-troops-japan/">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/trump-usfk-sma-10162024034010.html">South Korea</a>, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-taiwan-chips-invasion-china-910e7a94b19248fc75e5d1ab6b0a34d8">Taiwan</a> as a protection racket.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The third related point is Trump&#8217;s attitude toward nuclear weapons. Defying many predictions <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Bomb/Fred-Kaplan/9781982107307">made at the dawn of the nuclear age</a>, no nuclear weapon has been used in war since 1945, a record that likely involves both a bit of luck as well as the power of nuclear deterrence and the very justified fear these weapons cause. Trump, though, seems a bit more blase on the topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to former aides, Trump discussed using a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120">nuclear weapon against North Korea</a> as president during the period he was publicly threatening Kim Jong Un’s regime with “fire and fury.” As president, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/us/politics/trump-open-skies-treaty-arms-control.html">withdrew</a>, or<a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/05/trump-administrations-aggressive-approach-arms-negotiatons-could-backfire/165334/"> let lapse</a> a number of key arms control treaties, most famously the Iran nuclear deal, instead preferring an approach where the US would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-armscontrol/u-s-prepared-to-spend-russia-china-into-oblivion-to-win-nuclear-arms-race-u-s-envoy-idUSKBN22X2LS/">build up its own nuclear arsenal to spend its rivals into oblivion</a>. Recently on the campaign trail, he suggested that a reason presidents need legal immunity is so they could <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/trump-nuclear-president-crime/">use nuclear weapons without fear of legal repercussions</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The issue is not just Trump’s own attitude toward nuclear weapons. In a number of US allies in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24091566/europe-nuclear-weapons-poland-germany-france-putin-trump">Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/world/asia/south-korea-nuclear-arsenal.html">Asia</a>, there is now an active debate over whether they need nuclear deterrents of their own, driven in part by concerns over whether they could actually count on the US nuclear umbrella. Even Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently suggested that without effective security guarantees from allies, his country might need <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-nukes-volodymyr-zelenskyy-war-ukraine-aid-russia/">nuclear weapons</a> for protection. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The international community’s success at limiting the number of nuclear powers is one of the biggest reasons why the nuclear taboo has remained intact. But a world with more nuclear powers is a world where the use of nuclear weapons is more likely, and that world becomes more likely if allies don’t believe security guarantees are worth the paper they’re printed on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>An agent of chaos in the Oval Office</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump would no doubt counter that the very fact that the world has become so dangerous is the reason he should be returned to the presidency. He has repeatedly made the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-06-27/debate-trump-foreign-policy-russia-ukraine-gaza-israel">unprovable claims </a>that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Hamas’s October 7 attacks would not have happened had he been president. He has also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/13/trump-falsely-claims-no-terrorist-attacks-no-wars-during-his-presidency/">falsely claimed</a> that there were no terrorist attacks and no wars during his presidency. Those claims elide the major military escalations in Iraq, Syria, and Somalia that took place under his tenure, as well as risky actions like the assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, which prompted an Iranian missile strike on US troops in Iraq. Thankfully, no one was killed in those strikes, but commanders say up to 150 troops <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/03/01/al-asad-missile-attack-nearly-killed-150-us-troops-destroyed-30-aircraft-report.html">could have been</a>. As president, he reportedly considered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/mark-esper-book-trump.html">missile strikes</a> into Mexico and the idea of sending troops into America’s neighbor — and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2024/02/07/2023-results-are-in-us-has-new-top-port-trade-partner-export-import">No. 1 trading partner</a> — has evolved into a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/politics/trump-mexico-cartels-republican.html">mainstream Republican position</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump case, essentially, is that he was able to rule the world through fear. In his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5107967/viktor-orban-hungary-donald-trump-presidential-debate">cited</a> his ideological ally Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán: “Why is the whole world blowing up? [Orbán] said, ‘Because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him. China was afraid.’ And I don&#8217;t like to use the word afraid, but I&#8217;m just quoting him. &#8216;China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him.&#8217; Look at what&#8217;s going on with North Korea, by the way. He said &#8216;Russia was afraid of him.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-the-bully-with-a-heart-of-gold-2024-presidential-election-dd922dd6">claimed that he threatened</a> to strike Moscow if Putin attacked Ukraine, though it’s not quite clear when this was since Russian troops were in Ukrainian territory throughout the entirety of Trump’s presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also not clear that US adversaries were deterred by Trump’s tough-guy posturing. Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups/index.html">has maintained that the punishing sanctions</a> he put on Iran after withdrawing from the nuclear deal stopped it from orchestrating attacks in the region, but he had little response after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-does-not-want-war-after-attack-on-saudi-oil-facilities-idUSKBN1W10X6/">Iran attacked Saudi oil infrastructure in 2019</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The killing of Soleimani <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-iran-escalation-timeline-march-2020-update">did not stop Iran’s proxies from attacking US troops in Iraq</a>. When it comes to Taiwan, he has suggested that the island is simply too small and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-the-trump-or-harris-administration-approach-taiwan/">insignificant to be worth defending</a> — the kind of rhetoric that would surely influence China’s calculations over a possible invasion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Once more unto the breach?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, world affairs seem to be in a bit of a holding pattern, with leaders not making major decisions until they see the results of November 5. Trump may have soured a bit on his onetime good friend Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24072983/biden-trump-palestinians-israel-gaza-policy-different">but in all likelihood</a> — based on his past record — he would apply even less pressure than the Biden administration has to get Israel to reach a ceasefire in Gaza or allow in more humanitarian aid. A Trump win would likely embolden annexationists within the Israeli government, including the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israels-once-fringe-movement-to-reoccupy-gaza-gains-momentum-9bcb6a28">once-fringe but increasingly vocal movement</a> in favor of reoccupying Gaza with Israeli settlers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Ukraine, Trump has promised to end the conflict immediately. Judging by comments made by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war.html">running mate JD Vance</a>, though, this would likely involve pressuring Ukraine to both cede territory to Russia and accept neutrality, without security guarantees — not far from Putin’s desired outcome. When it comes to China, the outlook is more unpredictable. Trump portrays himself as the ultimate China hawk, except when he believes doing so is <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/trump-lies-china-coronavirus-timeline.html">bad for business</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, the question is not whether Trump is a hawk or a dove. It’s what a return of the chaos and unpredictability that marked his first tenure will mean in a world where the risk of cataclysm is now so much higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jacqueline Strickland was tired, but hopeful. The Washington, DC, early childhood educator had been teaching young children for nearly 40 years, and prayed that one day she would be fairly compensated for her experience and education. Strickland even went back to school, years into teaching, to upgrade her credentials, acquiring associate’s and bachelor’s degrees to better understand youth brain development. She watched as valued colleagues left for higher-paying pastures, teaching older children, driving school buses, working for the postal service.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Strickland kept with her career path though, partly out of passion for young kids, but also because she knew there was a local effort afoot to raise the wages of teachers like her. She began testifying at council hearings in support of the idea. Finally, two years ago, after years of waiting, Strickland’s salary was bumped. She’s gone from earning $57,000 a year to $75,000, and gained access <a href="https://www.dchealthlink.com/healthcare4childcare">to free health insurance</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m a mother of two, both my daughters have gone to college and I had to pay for school, maintain my own household, I didn’t have money to put away for retirement,” she said. “That was the scary part for me. I will be 60 in November and I couldn’t save.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Strickland’s raise came from the nation’s first program aimed at aligning the salaries of the city’s 4,000 day care teachers with their public school counterparts. Known as the Pay Equity Fund, this innovative program has paid more than $80 million over the last two years to augment the salaries of child care workers, and was funded by a new non-lapsing tax increase on DC’s wealthiest residents, approved by the local council in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the program’s&nbsp;first year, lead teachers like Strickland received lump-sum payments of $14,000, assistant teachers $10,000, and part-time teachers $5,000. In its second year, the city began issuing wage increases through quarterly payments, eventually transitioning these boosts into newly <a href="https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/page_content/attachments/Minimum%20Salary%20Requirement%20by%20Annual%20Salary%20and%20Hourly%20Wage.pdf">established salary minimums.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While DC&#8217;s Pay Equity program stands out for its scale, its wage supplement effort reflects a broader national trend, as states try to stabilize child care sectors hit hard by the pandemic and address the chronic underpayment of the workforce. In 2022, the median hourly wage for child care workers was just $<a href="https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/user-73607/naeyc_benefits_brief.may_2024.pdf">13.71</a>, significantly less than comparable roles like <a href="https://online.worcester.edu/programs/education/med-early-childhood-education/job-early-childhood-education-masters-grads/">preschool</a> and <a href="https://www.teachercertificationdegrees.com/careers/kindergarten-teacher/">kindergarten teacher</a>s. Child care is the <a href="https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/17351/the-declining-relative-quality-of-the-child-care-workforce">10th lowest-paid occupation</a> out of roughly 750 occupations in the economy, per one industry analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Out of recognition that families are already burdened by high costs and can’t afford to pay much more for child care, states like <a href="https://www.childcareservices.org/programs/wages/">North Carolina</a>, <a href="https://cecpd.org/Provider-Programs/The-Oklahoma-Child-Care-Wage-Supplement-Program">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="https://wisconsinearlychildhood.org/programs/reward/">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/ocfs/provider-resources/early-childhood-educator-workforce-salary-supplement-program">Maine</a>, and <a href="https://zaentznavigator.gse.harvard.edu/policy-strategies/child-care-wage-tennessee/">Tennessee</a> have introduced<strong> </strong>wage supplement programs to boost child care teacher recruitment, retention, and quality. And on the federal level, several proposals aim to bolster child care workers’ salaries. One bipartisan bill introduced this summer by Sens. Katie Britt (R-AL) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) proposes new <a href="https://www.ffyf.org/2024/07/31/senators-kaine-and-britt-introduce-new-bipartisan-child-care-plan/">federal grants</a> to state and local governments that supplement child care worker pay.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As politicians <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/375488/child-care-paid-leave-build-back-better-harris-ctc-preschool-biden-families">elevate child care on the campaign trail</a> and <a href="https://bpcaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-Caregiving-Poll-Results.pdf">polls</a> suggest it’s a <a href="https://www.ffyf.org/2024/05/16/new-polling-on-child-care-and-the-2024-election/">motivating</a> concern for voters, the pressure to raise wages for one of America’s most underpaid professions has taken on new importance. DC’s Pay Equity Fund is proving the model can work — provided elected officials stay committed to funding it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What we’ve learned from DC’s pay equity fund</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leading researchers have been analyzing the impact of DC’s wage supplement program on child care providers and the early education sector more broadly.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/RosemMorton_Vox_06.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Assistant teacher Mone Greene plays with a student at EduCare. | Rosem Morton for Vox" data-portal-copyright="Rosem Morton for Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Data from <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/wage-supplements-improve-early-educators-financial-well-being">the first two years of the program</a> showed that the wage supplements <a href="https://www.governing.com/workforce/d-c-has-an-excellent-model-for-strengthening-child-care-the-city-may-do-away-with-it">had increased</a> lead teachers&#8217; pay by 37 percent and assistant teachers&#8217; wages by 31 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a practical level, the increased pay has enabled child care teachers to pay off their debts, cover emergency expenses, and cover essentials like food, rent, and utilities. Some began <a href="https://earlylearningnation.com/2024/04/gas-groceries-homeownership-opportunities-and-kids-extracurriculars/">looking to purchase homes</a>, and nearly 70 percent said the fund allowed them to actually save money, some, like Strickland, for the first time in their careers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On an emotional level, many educators reported in surveys that the extra pay made them feel genuinely appreciated and respected, and that reduced financial stress helped them focus more on the children they work with.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers found that assistant teachers, in particular, reported significantly improved mental health. “Indeed, the Pay Equity Fund…appears to have contributed to educators’ beliefs that they are now being compensated fairly,” the Urban Institute <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Early_Educators_Reflections_on_the_DC_Early_Childhood_Educator_Pay_Equity_Fund.pdf">concluded</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From a hiring perspective, research by the think tank Mathematica found that the first few years of the Pay Equity Fund boosted the number of early childhood educators working in DC. Mathematica <a href="https://www.mathematica.org/publications/jobs-in-the-balance-the-early-employment-impacts-of-washington-dcs-early-childhood-educator-pay">estimated the program</a> led to an increase of 100 new hires, representing a 3 percentage point increase over what would have been expected without the wage boosts. Many child-care center directors also <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/center-directors-view-teacher-wage-supplements-benefiting-child-care-field">told Urban Institute researchers</a> that the wage supplements made it easier to attract qualified new teachers and easier to retain their best staff.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/RosemMorton_Vox_07.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Two women help young children as they play with purple play dough in a child care classroom." title="Two women help young children as they play with purple play dough in a child care classroom." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Assistant teachers Erica Brewer and Mone Greene assist students at EduCare. | Rosem Morton for Vox" data-portal-copyright="Rosem Morton for Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“What’s new about the pay equity program compared to other states is that they had a dedicated source of revenue,” said <a href="https://www.urban.org/author/erica-greenberg">Erica Greenberg</a>, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who has been studying the program. “And that it was not just to stabilize the sector, but was really also about fairness.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can the idea spread further?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taking a page out of DC’s playbook, Maine has similarly sought a dedicated funding stream to boost child care wages.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maine’s child care wage supplement program began in September 2021 using American Rescue Plan relief funds.&nbsp; “Stability grants” provided nearly 7,000 child care staff with an additional $200 per month, according to Tara Williams, the associate director of early care and education in Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services. Maine officials solicited feedback on how best to distribute the dollars, and concluded that sending the money to program owners and directors, so they could put the funding directly into staff payroll, made the most sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beginning in October 2022, Maine included the program in its state budget, continuing to fund it through general state revenues at a cost <a href="https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/mills-administration-issues-pay-increases-child-care-workers-2024-01-05">of $30 million annually</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It now exists <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/ocfs/provider-resources/early-childhood-educator-workforce-salary-supplement-program">as a three-tiered program,</a> in which the lowest eligible tier of child care workers can earn an additional $275 per month, the second tier earns an additional $415 per month, and the highest-tier providers can earn an <a href="https://mainebeacon.com/childcare-workers-can-now-get-paid-up-to-625-more-per-month/">additional $625 a month</a>.<br><br>“So that’s an over $3,000 a year bonus for the first tier,” Williams said proudly. “I’ve just been really excited to watch the expansion and implementation of this program.” Over 7,500 child care workers were receiving the Maine supplements as of June.<br><br>Williams has been sharing Maine’s experience with compensation reform with other states, including this past summer at a conference hosted by the North Carolina-based Hunt Institute.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Pennsylvania, advocates <a href="https://www.pennaeyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RecruitmentandRetentionReport-R1-1.pdf">have been organizing</a> for their own child care wage supplement program, arguing that such investments are necessary to address the state’s worker shortage. They pointed to Republican-led states like Alaska and Georgia that have recently made new investments to support child care wages ($<a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2024/05/24/alaska-lawmakers-pass-child-care-legislation-to-buoy-sector-in-crisis/">7.5 million</a> and $<a href="https://gbpi.org/overview-2025-fiscal-year-budget-for-the-georgia-department-of-early-care-and-learning/">23.6 million</a> respectively) and Democratic-led ones like New York and Minnesota that have done the same ($<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-applications-now-open-500-million-child-care-workforce-grants">500 million</a> and $<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/10/17/minnesota-set-to-start-spending-316m-to-boost-child-care-wages">316 million</a> respectively).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some cities are also taking their own steps. This past June, a coalition of care advocacy organizations launched an 18-month pilot in New York City <a href="https://allourkin.org/files/galleries/TPP_Press_Release_final.pdf">to provide $1,000 per month</a> to licensed home-based child care providers.“We have educators deciding every month what bills to pay, they are deciding every month whether to stay open,” said Jessica Sager, the CEO of <a href="https://allourkin.org/">All Our Kin</a>, a national group that trains and supports home-based child care educators and is involved with the pilot. “When educators don’t have that stress they can focus wholly on the care.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The policy will require sustained commitment</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wage supplements are not unique to child care, and governments have long used them to augment salaries of workers in fields like <a href="https://dol.ny.gov/home-health-care-aides-and-wage-parity">health care</a>, <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-238">home care</a>, and <a href="https://flag.dol.gov/wage-data/adverse-effect-wage-rates">agriculture</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet as promising as these wage supplements are, advocates are learning that even passing a dedicated funding stream is not enough to insulate the salary boosts from politics and annual budget fights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/04/03/dc-budget-bowser-cuts-tax-hikes/">proposed gutting</a> the Pay Equity Fund entirely as a way to balance the city’s budget amid flat growth and declining revenue from vacant office buildings. Teachers and community allies rallied for months in protest and in the end the DC Council restored <a href="https://www.dcnewsnow.com/news/local-news/washington-dc/dc-council-unanimously-passes-fy25-budget/">$70 million</a> to the program, though that still represented a $17 million cut.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We thought we were done with this kind of fighting — we had found a non-lapsing funding source for the program, there isn’t that much more security we can build in,” said Ruquiyyah Anbar-Shaheen, the director of early childhood at <a href="https://wearedcaction.org/">DC Action</a>, a local advocacy group. “The challenge is just having the political will to keep the program in place.”&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/RosemMorton_Vox_08.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Two Black women and several preschool-aged children hold onto a long, colorful walking rope as the teachers direct the children walking down a sidewalk." title="Two Black women and several preschool-aged children hold onto a long, colorful walking rope as the teachers direct the children walking down a sidewalk." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Jacqueline “Jackie” Strickland, 59, and her assistant teacher, Mone Greene, assist students on a walk. | Rosem Morton for Vox" data-portal-copyright="Rosem Morton for Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Strickland said if the city had gone forward with gutting the program, she would have had to look for an alternative job.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’ve been fighting this fight a long time, but this shouldn’t be a fight, it should be a given,” she told Vox. “It’s not a bonus, it’s what’s owed to early childhood educators. We put in a lot of time and we give children the foundation that supports them for future learning.”</p>

	<figcaption>A clash between Proud Boys and counterprotesters breaks out, in November 2020. Researchers say that the most socially connected people are more willing to say they’d use political violence.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Even before <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360489/trump-shot-thomas-matthew-crooks-secret-service-butler-rally">two people</a> attempted to <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/371981/trump-shooting-ryan-wesley-routh-golf-club">assassinate former President Donald Trump</a>, national security experts and law enforcement were warning that the United States <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/4836866-a-plan-to-address-political-violence-before-election-day/">needed a plan</a> to contend with the possibility of political violence on Election Day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, in the final weeks of the campaign, researchers have just published <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40621-024-00540-2">new findings</a> about the social lives of people who are likely to endorse using political violence, and be willing to use it themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The results, based on a nationally representative survey of more than 8,000 Americans, may seem counterintuitive. Basically, people open to the idea that political violence is justified tend to exist at opposite ends of the social spectrum. Those who report having no strong personal or work connections were 2.4 times more likely to say political violence is justifiable than people who said they have 1–4 close relationships. That’s not necessarily surprising, given the recent history of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/isla-vista-shooters-childhood-friend-the-guy-i-knew-wouldnt-say-a-word/">mass shooters</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/thomas-matthew-crooks-trump-shooter-78b13a35">politically motivated assailants</a> who’ve been <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/08/el-paso-shooting-when-loneliness-leads-mass-murder/595498/">described by their broader networks as loners</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s weird, though, is that people with lots of close connections were <em>also </em>a little more likely to endorse political violence. People who said they had 50 or more strong relationships were 1.2 times more likely to endorse political violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And here’s where it gets a little concerning: The people with no social connections weren’t on average any more likely to say they would be willing to personally commit political violence, even if they believed it was justified. But the people with lots of close relationships? They were 1.5 times more likely than the others to say they’d be willing to be violent for a political cause themselves. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s going on with those super socially connected people? Julia Schleimer, the researcher who led the study, told Vox over email that, compared to the people with just a few close connections, the 50+ cohort tended to be white, higher in income, slightly more educated, and older. But that’s also true of the demographic in the middle (which reported 10–49 social connections) and they weren’t especially open to the idea of political violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other words, there were no demographic factors about the group that jumped out to the researchers. “One limitation of this study is that we don’t have details on the nature or characteristics of people’s social networks, which likely matters a great deal and is an area for future study,” Schleimer said. But <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/pops.12239?casa_token=wifUF0BmKswAAAAA%3AcVa7JZnQxc1mxqRYcIvmfIqbckVthFTxEDur_lY-HyoyEPIiBQEHEwgWQbF3OkDQqDmCrqdOQm6hljO-">prior</a> <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RBA1071-1.html">studies</a> “give us reason to expect that people with very large social networks may be at greater risk for political violence, if those networks are characterized by antisocial norms, outgroup contempt, and extreme views.” That’s particularly true, she said, when the social networks are homogenous. Sometimes those groups form in person, but increasingly, they also develop online, like the Proud Boys and other far-right groups <a href="https://apnews.com/article/capitol-siege-proud-boys-donald-trump-congress-government-and-politics-a8baa24af07b20ab792f4ef6f4481fac">who organized in the days after Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/enrique-tarrio-capitol-riot-seditious-conspiracy-sentencing-da60222b3e1e54902db2bbbb219dc3fb">stormed the Capitol on January 6</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This research, done by University of California Davis’s <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/vprp/">Violence Prevention Research Program</a> (VPRP) builds on data <a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6crkf">published earlier this year</a> about Americans’ beliefs in political violence. The good news from the earlier work is that by and large, a vast majority of Americans are opposed to political violence under any circumstances. The more worrying news? A small proportion of Americans are open to the idea that political violence is sometimes justified.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I personally think that large-scale political violence is really, really unlikely. I feel more sanguine about that prediction, given our 2024 data,” Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the program, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/369441/political-violence-2024-election">told Vox</a> this summer. “But sporadic outbreaks, particularly if the battleground states remain really close — is it possible? Sure. Might there be attempts to intimidate election officials? Absolutely.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Violence Prevention Research Program applies a public health approach to issues like gun violence and political violence — meaning they look for interventions that can try to discourage them from happening. The new findings, Schleimer said, suggest that it’s important to develop approaches that target both those who are very lonely and<em> </em>those who are deeply connected, in, for example, extremist ideological groups. For the lonely, social skills training, community centers, cultural activities and more open and accessible cities can all be helpful. And both groups benefit from anti-violence messages from influential <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/937732">public figures</a> and on <a href="https://www.hfg.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/We-Want-You-To-Be-A-Proud-Boy.pdf">social media</a>. For the socially connected people, having a trusted figure who can support them as they begin opening up to different perspectives and challenging the beliefs of their ideology can be especially helpful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ideas sound really simple, but the researchers’ previous work suggests that getting someone to reject political violence is perhaps easier than you might think. “For the would-be combatants, a big number would switch if their family asked them not to, or friends, or even some media sources,” Wintemute told Vox. “We can create a climate of nonacceptance for political violence. And in doing that, we can expect that it will work.” Their findings are encouraging, in that respect. But reaching every person who might be open to political violence, in a highly divided country, with this many guns? That’s the tricky part.</p>

The slightest factor could impact the results either way — including the presence of a third-party candidate on the ballot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Third-party candidates don’t tend to get much traction: Without a major party behind them, every step of the electoral process is decidedly more difficult, including building name recognition, earning endorsements, getting on the ballot or a debate stage, and fundraising.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But third-party candidates don’t need much support to disrupt a race. In the last two election cycles, the average number of votes that decided the results in the seven swing states was less than 125,000 votes. In Wisconsin, for example, the election went Trump’s way by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/wisconsin">22,748 votes</a> in 2016 and Biden’s by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-president.html">20,682</a> in 2020 — an average margin of victory of less than 21,715 votes. And while any one third-party candidate is unlikely to crack that threshold alone, votes for all third-party candidates combined have well surpassed that threshold in some states.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/mGahQ-small-margins-in-swing-states-have-decided-the-last-two-presidential-elections-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,4.0216246681399,100,91.95675066372" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Nicole Narea" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said that this year, the third-party vote share is likely to be closer to what it was in 2020 (about 2 percent) than what it was in 2016 (about 6 percent). That might be in part because 2016 saw an unusually large share of Americans dissatisfied with their options for president, and Harris’s entry into the race to replace President Joe Biden this year appears to have <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/649397/democrats-drive-surge-election-enthusiasm.aspx">given most Democratic-leaning voters</a> a candidate they can get behind.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Kondik said it’s “possible, if not likely, that the total third-party share will be bigger than the margin between Trump and Harris in one or more states.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means that third-party voters, notoriously unpredictable and difficult to persuade, could play a decisive role in a very close election, swinging it in either Trump’s or Harris’s direction.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Who are the third-party candidates on the ballot?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a few key third-party candidates to know. None of them is very popular, but together, the top four are polling at about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html">3 percent nationally.</a> (Notably, most <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">polling averages</a> and <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model">models</a> have Harris and Trump within 2 percentage points of each other).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chief among the third-party candidates who made it on swing-state ballots this year is the Green Party’s Jill Stein, a progressive who drew Democratic-leaning voters in her previous two presidential bids.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stein is on the ballot in every swing state except Nevada, and she’s been backed by a Muslim American group called “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4947014-third-party-candidates-swing-states/">Abandon Harris</a>” in Michigan. The vice president is <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/22/arab-americans-poll-trump-harris-">struggling among Arab-American voters</a> there who helped power Biden’s 2020 victory in the state and who oppose the Biden administration’s approach to the war in Gaza.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both Stein and the Libertarian Party nominee Chase Oliver each claim about 1 percent support nationally, according to recent New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/presidential-election-third-party-candidates.html">polling</a>. That’s less than Stein’s vote share in 2016, when she last ran for president.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it could be enough to upset the results in the same states where she’s previously earned significant numbers of voters: In 2016, she earned more votes in the “Blue Wall” states of Michigan and Wisconsin than Trump’s margins of victory in those states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another potential wild card in those states is independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign and endorsed former President Donald Trump in August.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given his embrace of the anti-establishment views held by certain segments of the GOP and his status as a member of the Democratic Kennedy dynasty, he was once seen as a potential spoiler for both Trump and President Joe Biden. Kennedy was <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/22/rfk-jr-end-campaign-polls">polling around 10 percent</a> nationally for the better part of 2024, and even higher in some swing-state polls. But his support <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">cratered </a>to less than 5 percent in August after Harris assumed the Democratic nomination, suggesting that many Democrats saw him as the only alternative to Biden and were not particularly invested in his candidacy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, he has more potential to be a spoiler for Trump. He’s recently polled at about half a percentage point, on par with independent Cornel West, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/presidential-election-third-party-candidates.html">New York Times</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though he managed to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/27/rfk-background-state-ballots-00181481">take himself off the ballot </a>in Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada, he’s still on the ballot in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled to keep him on the ballot there, but he has <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4949934-robert-f-kennedy-jr-supreme-court-wisconsin-ballot/">appealed</a> that decision. It’s unclear how the court could render a decision in his favor from a practical standpoint; nearly 100,000 people have already received absentee ballots printed with his name.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A federal judge also ruled that Kennedy must <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/judge-says-rfk-jr-will-stay-on-michigans-ballot/">remain on Michigan’s ballot</a>, where the race has narrowed and Harris now holds less than a 1 percentage point lead in FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/michigan/">polling average</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other third-party candidates include the Socialism and Liberation Party’s Claudia De la Cruz, the Independent American Party’s Joel Skousen, the Constitution Party’s Randall Terry, and the Socialist Equality Party’s Joseph Kishore. None of them have the support the above four have managed to eke out, however.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Together, these third-party candidates have some potential to cut into both Harris and Trump’s vote margins in states that they need to win. Still, as much as third-party candidates may often appear to siphon away votes from the two major party candidates, the results of the election might not be any different if they were not on the ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Third-party voters can be quirky and may not be all that gettable by either campaign — perhaps some of them wouldn’t have voted major-party even if those were the only options,” Kondik said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When I began planning this newsletter, I thought through what kind of antipoverty solutions I’d want to dig into, from expanding programs like the child tax credit to proposing new, ambitious policies like baby bonds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But then I thought about how the United States already has a lot of antipoverty programs in place. So before focusing on what more the country ought to try, I wanted to ask a simple question: Could the US significantly reduce poverty even if lawmakers don’t create a single new program?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer, it turns out, is yes —&nbsp;and by a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the biggest problems with many of America’s antipoverty programs — like Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment benefits, and housing vouchers — has nothing to do with the programs themselves but with how state and federal governments choose to administer them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Put another way, there are <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/A%20Safety%20Net%20with%20100%20Percent%20Participation-%20How%20Much%20Would%20Benefits%20Increase%20and%20Poverty%20Decline_0.pdf">millions of Americans</a> who are eligible for existing welfare programs but still don’t receive all the benefits they are entitled to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have a huge array of different programs with the primary goal of reducing poverty and increasing income and economic security among [people], especially among families with children,” said Pamela Herd, a social policy professor at the University of Michigan. “But the way we&#8217;ve implemented those programs is fundamentally undermining that goal.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Herd is alluding to the administrative burden that’s attached to many welfare programs — obstacles that make it hard to receive benefits. (She’s <a href="https://www.russellsage.org/publications/administrative-burden">written a book</a> about this.) These <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-to-address-the-administrative-burdens-of-accessing-the-safety-net/">barriers often look like</a> lengthy and confusing applications that require troves of documents to prove that an applicant is indeed eligible, seemingly never-ending waitlists, work requirements, interviews, and a whole learning process to figure out which programs you ought to apply for and how. There are some programs that many would-be recipients don’t even know exist. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Are you even aware that there&#8217;s a program out there, for example, to help you pay for your heating in the winter and your cooling in the summer so that your electricity isn&#8217;t shut off or your heating and cooling isn&#8217;t shut off?” Herd said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politicians often justify these administrative burdens by saying they root out fraud, although sometimes they’re <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/exclusive-governor-ron-desantis-acknowledges-florida-unemployment-system-designed-frustrate/">designed with the explicit purpose</a> of reducing the number of people who receive benefits. But if lawmakers are serious about lifting people out of poverty, clearing unnecessary obstacles out of the way of existing welfare programs would be a good start.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How removing administrative burdens would reduce poverty</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the journalist Annie Lowrey <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/how-government-learned-waste-your-time-tax/619568/">put it in 2021</a>, administrative burdens are a “time tax … a public-policy cancer, mediating every American’s relationship with the government and wasting countless precious hours of people’s time.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And the poorer and more marginalized you are, the more likely you are to spend many days, weeks, and months jumping through hoops to get the federal assistance you’re already entitled to.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For instance, “Most people with employer-based [health] coverage don&#8217;t actually even realize that their <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59613">coverage is subsidized</a> by the government because we don&#8217;t have to do anything to access that subsidy,” Herd said. By contrast, people eligible for Medicaid — the primary means through which the federal government gives health coverage to low-income populations — have to face many hurdles before they get insured.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Look at how difficult it is to access the Medicaid program … tons of documentation, enrollment processes — people get kicked off all the time because they don&#8217;t do one of those 100 steps they&#8217;re supposed to do,” Herd said. “And then you have to do it pretty much every year.” (For reference, <a href="https://www.cbo.gov/publication/59613">21 percent of federal health insurance subsidies</a> go to employer-based coverage, and Medicaid gets about 25 percent.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fixing administrative burdens and streamlining the process of distributing subsidies would significantly reduce poverty. A <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/A%20Safety%20Net%20with%20100%20Percent%20Participation-%20How%20Much%20Would%20Benefits%20Increase%20and%20Poverty%20Decline_0.pdf">report by the Urban Institute</a>, which looked at a hypothetical situation in which everyone eligible for certain assistance programs actually received benefits, found that overall poverty would fall by 31 percent and child poverty would drop by 44 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, if the federal government figures out a way to make its social programs perfectly efficient, it will have to address another problem: Many programs that already exist aren’t properly funded. Housing vouchers, for example, are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/19/us/politics/housing-aid-rent-costs.html">severely underfunded</a>, serving fewer households than they did two decades ago despite the fact that the number of eligible households has grown. (Funding is a problem we’ll address in a future issue.)</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How lawmakers could remove administrative burdens</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It doesn’t take a stretch of the imagination to picture a world in which Americans can receive the benefits they’re eligible for without much of a hassle. For starters, a model already exists: Social Security, the country’s <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/social-security/social-security-lifts-more-people-above-the-poverty-line-than-any-other">most successful</a> antipoverty program, is extremely efficient in delivering benefits to retirees, in part because it’s <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/how-to-address-the-administrative-burdens-of-accessing-the-safety-net/">much easier to apply for</a> those benefits than for other programs.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The really interesting thing about that [retirement] program is that basically everyone who&#8217;s eligible receives those benefits, and there&#8217;s almost no fraud in the program,” Herd said. “We&#8217;ve designed that program in such a way so that it is not burdensome for participants.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just a few years ago, during the Covid-19 public health emergency, the federal government made it easier to enroll in Medicaid mostly by <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/10-things-to-know-about-the-unwinding-of-the-medicaid-continuous-enrollment-provision/">keeping people in the program</a> instead of requiring them to apply every year. Part of the reason many people lose Medicaid insurance is not because they’re no longer eligible, but because they may have gotten something wrong or incomplete on the forms. “<a href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/understanding-medicaid-procedural-disenrollment-rates/">Seventy percent</a> of people losing coverage are losing coverage for what they deem procedural reasons, which are like paperwork problems, basically,” Herd said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But since the public emergency ended and states started requiring recipients to recertify each year, <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/press-release/as-medicaid-unwinding-concludes-in-most-states-kff-finds-25-million-lost-medicaid-coverage-but-enrollment-is-10-million-higher-than-pre-pandemic-levels/#:~:text=News%20Release-,As%20Medicaid%20Unwinding%20Concludes%20in%20Most%20States%2C%20KFF%20Finds%2025,Higher%20Than%20Pre%2DPandemic%20Levels">millions of people</a> have lost their insurance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It might not seem like fixing this is politically feasible, even though the <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10985919/">majority of Americans support</a> easing administrative burdens. That’s because Republicans often deride public programs, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/miami/news/exclusive-governor-ron-desantis-acknowledges-florida-unemployment-system-designed-frustrate/">intentionally make it harder</a> to receive benefits, and put rules in place that are proven to fail, like <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/expanding-work-requirements-would-make-it-harder-for-people-to-meet">work requirements</a>. Still, some Democrat-controlled states have just as, if not more, difficult application processes for welfare recipients. California’s food stamp program, for example, has one of the <a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/usamap#">lowest participation rates</a> in the country. What’s their excuse?&nbsp;</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">In large barns across the US, packed with gates, crates, and hollering farmhands, animals are unloaded, pushed around, reloaded, and hauled away. Those who survive the chaos are sold to the highest bidder, to be killed for their meat. Those unable to cope with the hectic pace, intense heat, and harsh treatment are injured and sometimes die before they ever leave the grounds.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Livestock auctions — the stop between the farm and slaughterhouse — are a key cog in the machinery of animal agriculture. Formal livestock auctions <a href="https://www.rd.usda.gov/sites/default/files/cir1-14.pdf">date back to the 19th century</a>, when they became not only a way station for animals but also an important meeting place for farmers and others in the farm business. Today, there are approximately <a href="https://www.usrsb.org/Media/USRSB2024/Docs/frameworksummary-2.pdf">1,000 livestock auction markets across the US</a>, mostly located in the Midwest, the Great Plains, and the Southeast.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many small farms depend on auctions to acquire animals, which they raise before either selling them off to other farms or to sending them to slaughter. Factory farms buy young animals at auctions to mature in overcrowded mazes of outdoor pens before they are eventually killed, while corporate slaughterhouses purchase animals to be killed immediately. A <a href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/Marketing-feeder-cattle-changes-in-sales-data">2017 market analysis</a> estimates that “cattle sold in conventional auction markets account for 69 percent of the receipts.” The USDA told Vox that “it’s not uncommon for the same feeder calf to go through two or three auction markets in the same week.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The auctions employ locals, support local businesses, and provide opportunities for youth through programs like 4-H. In these spaces, a lifestyle that was forged during America’s westward expansion endures: “Get ‘em in, get ‘em out,” says Renee King-Sonnen, a former cattle rancher turned animal sanctuary operator. “It’s cowboy culture.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Vox_LivestockAuctions_01.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.716724659361,100,78.566550681279" alt="A worker pulls a goat by its ear into a gated area" title="A worker pulls a goat by its ear into a gated area" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of SEED" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">But behind the scenes, beyond the ramblings of the auctioneer and the bustle of the buyers, exists a “wild west,” says Pete Paxton, an undercover investigator with the group Strategies for Ethical and Environmental Development, or SEED, who shared his findings from a sprawling, multistate investigation into the auction system (Vox has agreed to use an pseudonym due to the undercover nature of Paxton’s work).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Between late 2022 and early 2024, Paxton said he investigated 17 auctions and markets, working undercover as an employee at 15, and attending two others as a member of the public. The auctions took place in 10 states: California, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Texas. He found he could get hired by auctions with minimal effort. He would work for a day —&nbsp;during which he said he would witness multiple instances of abuse —&nbsp;before moving on to the next market.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to Paxton, these markets are dark places where confused animals are kicked, shocked, and thrown. His findings also expose a stark lack of legal protections for animals at auctions, which are dominated by an industry culture that ignores animal suffering. Paxton, who for decades has investigated animal cruelty at factory farms and puppy mills, says he wanted to expose these hidden venues where corporate slaughterhouses and family farms meet —&nbsp;and where rampant abuses are usually shielded from public view.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Vox_LivestockAuctions_02.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.701894019475,100,78.59621196105" alt="An image of a farm worker squeezing a donkey between a gate and gate door" title="An image of a farm worker squeezing a donkey between a gate and gate door" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Animals are routinely handled roughly by livestock auction workers. | Courtesy of SEED" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of SEED" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Paxton reports witnessing “sadistic abuse” and other disturbing but common practices, documenting his experiences in undercover video footage, photos, and thoroughly written firsthand accounts. Experts say the materials highlight a hole in US animal welfare law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The US has no federal laws or regulations protecting farm animals from physical abuse,” Dr. <a href="https://www.americanhumane.org/scientists/james-reynolds-dvm-mpvm/">James Reynolds</a>, a veterinarian and professor of large animal medicine at Western University of Health Sciences, said. The treatment of animals at auctions revealed by Paxton&#8217;s investigations “speak loudly for [the need for] federal regulations to protect these animals.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Horrific abuses documented at livestock auctions across the country</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Auctions typically walk animals — including cows, sheep, goats, and donkeys — through to be sold, Paxton said. (Smaller animals, such as birds or rabbits, are sold in cages.) Auction workers have to keep the animals moving, but many animals resist, or are too injured or ill to move. That often leads to violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Paxton’s videos and photos, cows at various auctions who are unable to stand (also known as downed cows) are shocked with electric prods in efforts to make them move. Older animals like cull cows — cows who no longer produce enough milk for the dairy industry — are often brought to auction injured, sick, or otherwise immobile. Animals young and old alike can endure great stress while being transported, inside cramped trailers, enduring extreme weather, transport times up to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/15/more-than-20-million-farm-animals-die-on-way-to-abattoir-in-us-every-year">28 hours (or more)</a>, where some fall and get injured.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Buffalo Livestock Market in Texas, Paxton witnessed a downed cow being dragged by a forklift with a chain around her neck. The forklift operator can be seen in the video and heard laughing. Reynolds, after reviewing the footage, called the treatment “definite animal cruelty.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same auction, footage shows a worker throwing a calf with a broken leg into a transport truck for a buyer, who remarks, with a laugh, “He can’t get no more fucked up than he is.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reynolds told Vox he believed the auction employee handled the calf “without regard for the pain being inflicted on the animal,” adding that he thought the animal “needed to receive either medical care or to be euthanized.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Athens Commission Company, another auction in Texas, Paxton documented a goat being dragged by the horns and thrown to the ground before being chased. He recorded similar abuse of goats at Central Livestock in Kansas, and of sheep at Pawnee Sale Barn in Oklahoma.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At Emory Livestock in Texas (owned by <a href="http://emorylivestockauction.com">the same family</a> as Athens Commission Company), a donkey from whom a worker is attempting to draw blood is intentionally squeezed between two gates to hold the animal still. The worker repeatedly kicks the animal while screaming at it “for no clear reason,” Paxton said. Workers also violently push goats from transport trucks, and force collapsing cows to keep moving.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dogs attack a sheep in another video from Colby Livestock Auction Company in Kansas. And a calf is shocked with an electric prod to the face at Empire Livestock Auction in New York to keep the animal moving.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reynolds told Vox he was particularly “appalled” by footage from Waverly Sales Company in Iowa, in which a worker squeezes a goat&#8217;s head between a wall and a gate while “the poor animal scream[s] in pain,” he said. One worker then grabbed the goat by the scrotum and threw the animal several feet. The abuse was severe enough that Paxton sent photos and video to local law enforcement; the individual was charged with a misdemeanor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These acts of violence may seem extreme to outsiders, but Paxton says they are the norm at auctions in order to keep the animals moving and maximize sales. “Workers are often ordered by management to move downed or slow animals by any means necessary,” Paxton said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The compiled footage shows people acting with “appalling cruelty and lack of care about animals,” Reynolds says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vox reached out to each auction company mentioned for comment, but did not receive any replies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>State and federal laws don’t protect animals at auctions</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Animal agriculture generally operates under regulatory exemptions or relatively lax rules — a doctrine known as <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/31/23852325/farming-myths-agricultural-exceptionalism-pollution-labor-animal-welfare-laws">agricultural exceptionalism</a>. As a result, livestock auctions are governed by norms often set by the industry rather than animal welfare laws.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are no federal laws in the US that protect farm animals at auctions from mistreatment, says <a href="https://www.vermontlaw.edu/faculty/winders-delcianna">Delcianna Winders</a>, associate professor of law and director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at Vermont Law and Graduate School. (Disclosure: I attended a media fellowship at VLGS in 2021.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While most states do require licensing for livestock auctions, this is generally regulated by state agriculture departments, Winders says, “and their priorities are not animal welfare.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather, Winders continues, the objective for state agencies is to support the agriculture industry. She points to Nebraska, where the stated purpose of the state’s Livestock Auction Market Act is “to encourage, stimulate, and stabilize the agricultural economy of the state in general, and the livestock economy in particular” — not to regulate animal welfare.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Vox_LivestockAuctions_09.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.7410192872,100,78.517961425601" alt="A light-colored cow laying weakly in the back of a farm truck" title="A light-colored cow laying weakly in the back of a farm truck" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A “downed” cow waits in the back of a truck. | Courtesy of SEED" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of SEED" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Some states, including California, Maryland, Michigan, and Oregon do have limited welfare requirements for animals at auctions. They may require that downed animals be humanely euthanized or that the sale of animals unable to move on their own is prohibited. But Winders describes such laws as “not robust,” and she doubts whether they are enforced. California law, for example, requires that “no slaughterhouse, stockyard, auction, market agency, or dealer shall buy, sell, or receive a nonambulatory animal.” Yet the evidence Paxton gathered at a California auction shows a downed Holstein cow being shocked with an electric prod and then dragged by machinery when unable to move.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) said in a statement to Vox it “does not condone inhumane treatment of livestock but does not have authority for enforcement” and added that “suspected abuse should be referred to local agencies as soon as possible for investigation.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Auctions are part of a distinctly American way of life</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Livestock auctions, insider accounts suggest, are insular, male-dominated spaces that, while technically open to the public, remain removed from the mainstream gaze. They are a world where animals are moved with ruthless efficiency, and their commodification is handed down over generations as a way of life.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The auction environment is a &#8220;frenzy of consumption,&#8221; said Kathryn Gillespie, the author of <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo28907793.html"><em>The Cow With Ear Tag #1389</em></a><em>,</em> who has visited dozens of auctions while researching that book and a forthcoming book focused on auctions. Sales happen in &#8220;under a minute,” she says; calves with umbilical cords still attached can sell for around $15. She said some of those calves die.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the auctions Gillespie visited were populated “almost entirely [by] men,” she says. She often felt uncomfortable as a woman who was not native to the culture. “I didn’t always feel safe,” she recounts. One time, she was asked to leave.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other auctions were more fun and family-friendly, even entertaining. “It’s very engaging to watch an auction. The auctioneer is very dynamic,” she says. “It’s a sort of performance.” These auctions function as a gathering space for the community. “It’s a very communal, social space.”&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Vox_LivestockAuctions_06.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Dozens of sheep crowded together in a pin in front of a large white barn" title="Dozens of sheep crowded together in a pin in front of a large white barn" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Animals are tightly packed into small spaces on their way to and from and at the auctions, adding to the risk of injury. | Courtesy of SEED" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of SEED" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Tommy Sonnen, a former cattle rancher, agrees. “It’s a place that the locals go; they spend a lot of time there. … They have their lunch there.” Sonnen comes from a long line of ranchers, but says he “always felt uncomfortable” when he saw injured animals at auctions. About a decade ago, he became a vegan and an animal rights activist. He has since co-founded, with his wife Renee King-Sonnen, <a href="https://rowdygirlsanctuary.org">Rowdy Girl Sanctuary in Texas</a>, which cares for animals rescued from the meat industry.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Treating animals inhumanely has always been normalized at auctions, King-Sonnen says, as a necessary means to get the job done.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also a culture that protects its own. Paxton recalls witnessing auction workers beating animals in the open, while people attending with their kids watched.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Animals need legal pro</strong>tections at auctions</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The broader fight to protect animals farmed for food in the US faces many obstacles: <a href="https://missouriindependent.com/2024/06/06/meat-industry-increases-political-spending-lobbying-as-usda-updates-crucial-regulations/#:~:text=Meat%20industry%20groups%20and%20major,was%20an%20all%2Dtime%20high.">powerful agricultural lobbies</a>, <a href="https://unitedegg.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Full-Report-Caputo-et-al.-2023-February-20.pdf">economic concerns</a> about the impact of raising <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348829398_Costs_and_Benefits_of_Improving_Farm_Animal_Welfare">animal welfare standards</a>, and a <a href="https://www.farmforward.com/news/us-consumers-would-be-concerned-upon-learning-where-meat-really-comes-from/#:~:text=Lastly%2C%2020%20percent%20say%20they,about%20how%20meat%20is%20produced.">lack of widespread public awareness</a> of the industry’s cruelty that might create empathy for these animals. Auctions, which are usually only a brief stop on the way to the farms and slaughterhouses where <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/3/9/22967328/animal-cruelty-laws-state-federal-exemptions-pennsylvania-martin-farms-dairy-calves-dehorning">other well-documented abuses are systematized</a>, have not been a priority for reform given the larger struggle to get the government to do anything to stop the abuses of factory farming.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonetheless, Reynolds said,“it is apparent that livestock auctions in the US need regulations that protect animals from abuse.”&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Vox_LivestockAuctions_05.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Three lifeless cows lying on the ground within a gated area" title="Three lifeless cows lying on the ground within a gated area" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="“Downed” cows are often forcibly moved through livestock auctions so they can be sold and sent to the slaughterhouse. | Courtesy of SEED" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of SEED" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For Winders, the first step would be to take the responsibility of animal welfare away from state agriculture departments “whose focus is on promoting agriculture and trying to protect industry.” She points to Vermont, which recently <a href="https://www.mynbc5.com/article/animal-welfare-bill-vermont/61073058">created</a> an animal welfare division within the Department of Public Safety tasked with enforcing animal welfare laws.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Humane handling requirements, inspections, and meaningful enforcement including the loss of auction licenses could all have an impact, Winders said. She is not aware of any such efforts, however, by state lawmakers or regulators.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some animal advocacy groups are working to <a href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftitus.house.gov%2Fuploadedfiles%2Ftitus_107_xml.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7C%7C22a4387106044a5760bc08dc921f2878%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638545909730038540%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=MLRgIcIEd%2FzF%2BUCbTeoTi0ZdvL5oWR975YVSfYzK3aY%3D&amp;reserved=0">create better federal regulations for the transportation of livestock</a>, which could help improve the condition in which animals arrive at the auctions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Animal Welfare Institute has <a href="https://awionline.org/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/AWI-Transport-Petition-Rulemaking.pdf">petitioned the federal government</a> to create new protections for livestock in transport. They are lobbying for mandatory fitness checks and veterinary inspections for any vulnerable animals sent across state lines directly to slaughter.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Our petition would tangentially help the most vulnerable animals that go through auctions,” said Adrienne Craig, policy associate and staff attorney for the AWI’s Farmed Animal Program.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But merely creating these new rules would not mean they&#8217;re followed.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Vox_LivestockAuctions_10.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="a sheep within a crowded pin is seen with uneven, dry, rashy skin and swollen eyes" title="a sheep within a crowded pin is seen with uneven, dry, rashy skin and swollen eyes" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Research has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2024/july/zoonotic-disease-threats-posed-by-animal-industries-uncovered-in.html&quot;&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; livestock auctions are a vector for the spread of animal-borne diseases. | Courtesy of SEED" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of SEED" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“The problem with focusing on transportation regulation is always enforcement,” says <a href="https://aldf.org/person/chris-green/">Chris Green,</a> executive director of Animal Legal Defense Fund. The USDA, which is in charge of regulating and overseeing the transport of farm animals, does not have a record of “much, if any, meaningful enforcement,” he says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Paxton says that while he supports efforts to improve regulations for transport, including decreasing travel time, “that won&#8217;t do anything for 99 percent of animals that go to an auction” because most come relatively short distances from local farms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It also wouldn’t stop the abuses at the auctions themselves. It’s there, Paxton says, where change will have to happen.</p>

Or, improbably, <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucm9sbGluZ3N0b25lLmNvbS9wb2xpdGljcy9wb2xpdGljcy1mZWF0dXJlcy9lbG9uLW11c2stdHJ1bXAtdGF4LWJyZWFrLWVsZWN0aW9uLTIwMjQtMTIzNTE0MTM4MC8_dWVpZD0xYjc3MjIzNzdmMDc1YzAxMGFmZjczYzlhZWUxZjAwMw/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5Bbeb43df4">a tax break</a>?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What does loyalty to Trump net him — or anyone else courting the former president’s favor — in the end?&nbsp;<br>I spoke with Vox senior reporter Whizy Kim, who has been reporting on Musk, his fans, lawsuits, and even <a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9yZWNvZGUvMjAyMi8xMC8xLzIzMzgxMjU3L2Vsb24tbXVzay10ZXh0cy10d2l0dGVyLWJpbGxpb25haXJlcz91ZWlkPTFiNzcyMjM3N2YwNzVjMDEwYWZmNzNjOWFlZTFmMDAz/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5Becb664b2">his text messages</a> since the months leading to his 2022 purchase of Twitter, to try to understand where Elon Musk the man, the media mogul, and the politically ambitious demagogue intersect. What does Musk really want? And if he gets it, what will it mean for the rest of us? (Our conversation has been condensed for length and lightly edited.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Lavanya Ramanathan: When you look back on the moment&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS90aGUtZ29vZHMvMjAyMi8xMS8yOC8yMzQ3MzIzOS9lbG9uLW11c2stdHdpdHRlci1jZW8tbGVhZGVyc2hpcD91ZWlkPTFiNzcyMjM3N2YwNzVjMDEwYWZmNzNjOWFlZTFmMDAz/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B7022e310"><strong>Elon Musk bought Twitter</strong></a><strong>, and now consider it in the current context of how he’s now trying to invest heavily in politics, do you see parallels there?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Whizy Kim:&nbsp;</strong>I don’t think it is at all an accident that Elon Musk decided to buy Twitter, and then slowly became more politically vocal. He has a huge megaphone now. He&#8217;s the owner of a site that a lot of people still use, especially for stuff that&#8217;s related to the news. So I do think that there is a direct connection between him first talking about how Twitter should be this public “<a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdHdpdHRlci1zcGFjZXMtbXVzay1kZXNhbnRpcy1wcmVzaWRlbnRpYWwtZjFkNjcwOTdkMGVjMTk2MTZiZDBiMGQzMjBjYjI3ZDE_dWVpZD0xYjc3MjIzNzdmMDc1YzAxMGFmZjczYzlhZWUxZjAwMw/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B45e99a4e">town square</a>” where everyone can have their beliefs heard, where free speech is respected, to today, where he has reinstated a lot of banned accounts, including Trump,&nbsp;<a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly9hcG5ld3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdHdpdHRlci1zcGFjZXMtbXVzay1kZXNhbnRpcy1wcmVzaWRlbnRpYWwtZjFkNjcwOTdkMGVjMTk2MTZiZDBiMGQzMjBjYjI3ZDE_dWVpZD0xYjc3MjIzNzdmMDc1YzAxMGFmZjczYzlhZWUxZjAwMw/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5C45e99a4e">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>, and other incendiary figures. There’s also much more right-wing content that you see on the site if you visit X today compared to a few years ago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>There’s been a big transformation in the way Americans perceive Elon Musk since then. Besides the fact that the value of Twitter has tanked and the number of users has declined, you&#8217;ve written about his fanboys, the people that really looked up him — predominantly young men. Is he still really influential with this set?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the past, he was definitely seen as more of a liberal hero. Not that he was always supporting Democratic candidates and politicians, but he was a guy who had popularized electric vehicles. When I&nbsp;<a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudm94LmNvbS9yZWNvZGUvMjAyMi8xMC8yOC8yMzQyNjkyMi9lbG9uLW11c2stYXJteS1mYW5kb20tZm9ybWVyLWZhbnMtdHdpdHRlci1jZW8_dWVpZD0xYjc3MjIzNzdmMDc1YzAxMGFmZjczYzlhZWUxZjAwMw/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B263b0860">talked to his former fans for a piece</a>, a lot of them talked about how they were drawn to his passion for climate change and the environment. He cared about the future of humanity. And they saw him as very much like a mythic heroic figure, kind of a Tony Stark. They admired how much he seemed to be in service of civilization, not just with Tesla, but even with SpaceX, and wanting to further humanity&#8217;s mission beyond Earth.&nbsp;<br><br>And then the more he talked on Twitter, especially about his political views, they realized he could be very volatile. He could really lash out at anyone who criticized him. Several people told me that doesn&#8217;t seem befitting of a CEO of several major companies, acting childishly and immaturely in reaction to someone maybe making a good point.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I hear a lot of similarities between him and Donald Trump there. What do these two men have in common?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Personality-wise, and just in terms of their worldview, what I really noticed&nbsp;<a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1ReldqRnpSTVFOQSZ1ZWlkPTFiNzcyMjM3N2YwNzVjMDEwYWZmNzNjOWFlZTFmMDAz/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B472dedba">from the X conversation that they had</a>&nbsp;in August was that they both come from a place of feeling personally aggrieved. Trump at many points talked about how his opponents had engaged unfairly against him, all of these criminal court cases against him, these trials, because they don’t want him to win the election. They’ve both frequently been critics of the media. Elon Musk has also talked about how legacy media is really biased and doesn&#8217;t platform the truth. They could sort of look at each other and say, “Yeah, you get me. We’ve both been unfairly attacked.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>And what is their end game here? What does Elon Musk stand to gain from an association with Trump, and now a financial stake in Trump’s victory?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the Biden administration, Elon Musk felt that a lot of these regulatory agencies are staffed with people who are keeping a close eye over corporate misbehavior. His companies have been investigated or fined by different government agencies, whether it&#8217;s the&nbsp;<a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV1dGVycy5jb20vbGVnYWwvc3BhY2V4LXdpbnMtYmxvY2stdXMtbGFib3ItYm9hcmQtY2FzZS1vdmVyLXNldmVyYW5jZS1hZ3JlZW1lbnRzLTIwMjQtMDctMTAvP3VlaWQ9MWI3NzIyMzc3ZjA3NWMwMTBhZmY3M2M5YWVlMWYwMDM/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5Ba6319cca">Labor Board</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaXNobi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTE0MTAxLWVsb24tbXVza3MtYm9yaW5nLWNvbXBhbnktY2l0ZWQtYnktb3NoYS1mb3Itc2VyaW91cy1zYWZldHktdmlvbGF0aW9ucz91ZWlkPTFiNzcyMjM3N2YwNzVjMDEwYWZmNzNjOWFlZTFmMDAz/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B6888c405">OSHA</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2ZveC1uZXdzLXRlY2gvc2VjLXNlZWstc2FuY3Rpb25zLWFnYWluc3QtZWxvbi1tdXNrLXR3aXR0ZXItcHJvYmUtb3Zlci1mYWlsdXJlLWFwcGVhci1jb3VydD91ZWlkPTFiNzcyMjM3N2YwNzVjMDEwYWZmNzNjOWFlZTFmMDAz/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5B67825f5a">the SEC</a>, or the&nbsp;<a href="https://link.vox.com/click/37210962.100560/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmV1dGVycy5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9tdXNrLWJyYWluLWltcGxhbnQtY29tcGFueS12aW9sYXRlZC11cy1oYXphcmRvdXMtbWF0ZXJpYWwtdHJhbnNwb3J0LXJ1bGVzLTIwMjQtMDEtMjYvP3VlaWQ9MWI3NzIyMzc3ZjA3NWMwMTBhZmY3M2M5YWVlMWYwMDM/64ea41d450f053fabe0ceea5Bcf74ef90">Department of Transportation</a>, and Elon Musk sees this as unfair. Even if he acknowledges that his companies didn&#8217;t follow safety regulations, he&#8217;ll be like, well, those safety measures are stupid, anyway. I think I know best. I run my company. I am an expert in these fields. The government is just clunky and slowing us down.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the things that he proposed during the Trump interview was some sort of government efficiency commission. And Trump was kind of like, oh, yeah, that&#8217;s a good idea … and maybe you can help run it. Essentially, that kind of commission would slash the budgets of a lot of regulatory agencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump and Musk are sort of framing that as creating a government that&#8217;s more sensible and efficient about the budget, but really, it could also potentially serve as a way to flush the budgets of agencies that have been coming after his companies. If he has Trump’s ear, you know, he could say, “Well, maybe if you want to appoint a new person to the Labor Board, it should be someone more friendly to businesses, rather than to workers.” That&#8217;s a potential kind of alliance that they could form.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>We know that billionaires, that Silicon Valley, are oftentimes more secretive about their involvement in politics. What Elon Musk has been doing is really shining a light on big business billionaire donors and the way they operate in the political sphere, so it’s easier to see. Where does this end for Musk, if Trump wins, or if Trump doesn&#8217;t win?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I do think that he will continue to be more politically vocal, because he’s opened up a can of worms. It’s harder to go back when there&#8217;s a long record of him coming out for a Trump crowd, officially endorsing him, and all of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elon Musk is the evolution of what started from Peter Thiel. When Thiel first came out as this mega-conservative donor, people were like, wow, he’s so open and vocal in a world that tends to be more liberal. Now, we have Elon Musk, we have David Sacks, all these other Silicon Valley figures who are trying to elect Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But obviously, one of the reasons why these wealthy, influential figures try to stay quiet is because they want to play both sides, right? Elon Musk has come out so vociferously as pro-Trump and criticizing Biden and criticizing Kamala Harris. If Kamala Harris wins, is there room for Elon to come back and say, “Hey, let’s still work together in some capacity?” That&#8217;s going to be a much harder road.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A massive gender gap has been evident in <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3908">poll</a> after <a href="https://echelonin.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/September-Omnibus-Crosstabs-EXTERNAL-1.pdf">poll</a> of this election — a significant trend that underscores the pivotal role women could play this November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Most recently, a late October <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3915">Quinnipiac survey of Michigan</a> found 57 percent of women in the state back Vice President Kamala Harris, while 40 percent of men did the same. Conversely, 56 percent of men backed former President Donald Trump, while 37 percent of women did. That’s repeatedly been the case in national polls, too. For example, a recent <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/10/25/harris-trump-poll-gender-gap/75697863007/">poll from USA Today/Suffolk University</a> found that Harris had a 16-point gap in the support that she saw from men and women.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It&#8217;s the battle of the sexes, and it&#8217;s no game,” Quinnipiac pollster <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3915">Tim Malloy said in a statement</a>. “There is a glaring gap in Michigan and Wisconsin between the number of women supporting Harris and the number of men supporting Trump.” In Quinnipiac polls conducted in five of the seven key swing states throughout October, Harris had a significant lead among women, while Trump saw a comparable advantage among men in those same places. (Quinnipiac has not released October results for Nevada and Arizona.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Women supporting Democrats over Republicans isn’t a new phenomenon: Members of the group have been <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-younger-voters-will-impact-elections-the-gender-gap/">more likely to support the party</a> than men since the 1980s, and this <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/609914/women-become-liberal-men-mostly-stable.aspx">political divide has only grown</a> over time. This time around, though, that split could have major implications for the election outcome due both to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">how tight the race is</a>, and other demographic shifts.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to recent polls, Democrats seem to be losing support among groups they’ve counted on in the past, like <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/trump-is-gaining-ground-with-some-black-men-heres-how-harris-can-change-their-minds">Black men</a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-gains-with-hispanic-men-harris-up-with-white-women-reutersipsos-polls-show-2024-10-25/">Latino men</a>. Those losses could be made up by boosting turnout among women, particularly since <a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout">women are more likely to vote</a> than men<a href="https://cawp.rutgers.edu/facts/voters/gender-differences-voter-turnout">,</a> and historically do so in <a href="https://www.iowapbs.org/shows/catt/clip/5320/why-women-vote-higher-percentages">larger numbers</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The women’s vote will be decisive this election,” <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2024-10-21/election-day">Katherine Tate, a Brown University political scientist</a>, said. “If Harris wins, it will be because women elected her.”</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The gender gap is a sign of the inroads Democrats have made over time</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Women have backed Democrats by a significant margin in multiple cycles now. In 2020, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">President Joe Biden won 55 percent of women voters</a>, while Trump won 44 percent, and in 2016, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls">former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</a> won 54 percent of women voters, while Trump won 39 percent, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/">according to Pew Research Center</a>. If the actual outcome approaches the figures that pollsters are seeing, Democrats could well maintain these margins.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Part of Democrats’ growth with women comes from ideological shifts: A higher proportion of <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/609914/women-become-liberal-men-mostly-stable.aspx">women across all age groups are now identifying as liberal</a>, compared to two decades ago, according to a Gallup survey published in February. And younger women between the ages of 18 to 29, especially, are one of the groups now far more likely to identify as liberal than they were in the past. Gallup found 40 percent of young women identified as liberal in 2023 compared to 29 percent in 1999. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the left is adding women, it’s gaining few men, however. In that same 24-year timeframe, Gallup found the proportion of men who identify as liberal across age groups has stayed relatively unchanged: Just 25 percent of young men identified as liberal in 2023, only 1 percentage point more than in 1999.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Women’s leftward shift has been driven by a combination of factors, including <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2024/08/14/trump-sexist-vance-republican-misogyny-women/74631430007/">opposition to misogynistic rhetoric from GOP leaders</a> and allegations of sexual misconduct faced by prominent political figures — like Trump, who’s the subject of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23696250/e-jean-carroll-trump-trial-sexual-misconduct-rape-allegations">more than 20 accusations of sexual assault and misconduct</a>, including a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/23/donald-trump-accuser-stacey-williams-jeffrey-epstein">new allegation this week</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Social movements like the #MeToo movement raised awareness of sexual misconduct and harassment in 2017. And women became more <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/10/31/17566066/young-women-congress">involved politically</a> in the wake of Trump’s election, organizing via demonstrations like the Women’s March and running for elected office in record numbers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democrats’ stances on social issues including reproductive rights, and the outrage over the Supreme Court decision overturning <em>Roe v. Wade</em> in 2022 have also resonated with some women. Trump was responsible for appointing the justices who led the overturn of <em>Roe</em>, and has <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-was-able-kill-roe-v-wade-rcna84897">bragged about his role</a> in doing so. Democrats, meanwhile, have fashioned themselves as the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24101209/abortion-reproductive-freedom-biden-2024-election">party dedicated to defending reproductive health care</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the 1980s, many women have increasingly viewed <a href="https://time.com/5903399/gender-gap-politics/">Democrats as operating in their economic interest</a> too, Roosevelt Institute historian Suzanne Kahn wrote for Time. That idea can be traced back to President Ronald Reagan’s decision to cut social benefits like Social Security and welfare, a reduction that disproportionately harmed women, Kahn wrote. And it’s since been solidified by efforts by Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton to pass laws addressing the gender wage gap and establishing family leave.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Women believe that they or their family may need government help or protection,” Democratic pollster Celinda Lake says. “Men think it’s a good day when the government doesn’t do anything bad to you.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And Democrats have been able to take advantage of the power of representation as the party has diversified as well. The Democratic Party itself has become more representative of women in recent decades, and made a successful push for the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2023/1/10/23539585/congress-diverse-republicans-house">recruitment and promotion of women candidates</a>, something Republicans are still catching up to.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the House, for example, <a href="https://www.state.gov/briefings-foreign-press-centers/women-in-politics#:~:text=So%20if%20we%20look%20at,of%20the%20Democratic%20state%20delegation.">43 percent of Democratic lawmakers are women</a>, while 15 percent of Republican lawmakers are women. The party’s efforts have also led to two women at the top of Democrats’ presidential ticket, including Harris, something many <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/spotlights/2024/its-our-time-as-harris-accepts-the-nomination-many-women-say-a-female-president-is-long-overdue/">Democratic voters have expressed excitement</a> about.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Women’s leftward shift has calcified into party affiliation with Democrats, Lake says, and that could have major consequences this election cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyoncé wasn&#8217;t just on the playlist at Vice President Kamala Harris&#8217;s Houston rally on Friday, she was also a special guest.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question is just how much Beyoncé can help Harris. The rally in deep-red Texas comes as the vice president finds herself in a dead heat <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">nationally</a> (and in <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/">most swing states</a>) against former President Donald Trump, and as Democrats’ Texas Senate candidate Colin Allred <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2024/texas/general/">narrows the gap</a> with his GOP rival, Sen. Ted Cruz.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Friday, Beyoncé became the latest influential celebrity to make a splashy endorsement of Harris — someone she’d already implicitly backed by allowing Harris to use a track from her album <em>Lemonade </em>as her campaign song. She joins the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/371396/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement-democrats-elon-musk" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/culture/371396/taylor-swift-kamala-harris-endorsement-democrats-elon-musk">likes of Taylor Swift</a> and Oprah, both of whom threw their weight behind the Harris campaign earlier this year, alongside other celebrities like Megan Thee Stallion, Quavo, and Charli XCX. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While celebrity endorsements haven’t necessarily been found to sway voters from one candidate to another, Beyoncé’s endorsement could motivate her fans to participate in the election. That could come in the form of increased voter registration, or higher turnout among young voters, women, and Black voters — all of whom are both key members of Beyoncé’s audience and critical Democratic constituencies that the party needs to show up in large numbers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given how closely contested this election has been, any advantage — including just the boost in attention from a Beyoncé endorsement — could prove important. More than others in recent memory, <a href="https://theconversation.com/in-the-us-election-7-states-and-a-few-swing-voters-have-all-the-power-this-is-exposing-hidden-tensions-in-both-campaigns-240670">polls suggest</a> this race could come down to small numbers of votes in key states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Even though the effects are generally thought of as modest, in elections that turn on a small number of votes in a handful of swing states, any effect could be significant,” Bowling Green State University professor <a href="https://www.bgsu.edu/arts-and-sciences/political-science/faculty-and-staff-directory/David-Jackson.html">David J. Jackson</a> previously told Vox.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The impact Beyoncé’s endorsement could have&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Celebrity endorsements haven’t necessarily been found to persuade voters — though they can gin up enthusiasm among people who follow them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Oprah Winfrey’s support of former President Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary is the rare example of a specific endorsement having a tangible, scientifically studied impact on candidate choice. According to a <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/garthwaite/htm/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf">2013 Northwestern University study</a>, her endorsement — one of just a few political statements of support she’s made — translated to an uptick in turnout, donations, and approximately a million votes in favor of Obama.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A key caveat of that study is that it centered on a Democratic primary, when voters were choosing from candidates with the same party affiliation, rather than a general election, when candidates tend to have major partisan differences. Additionally, experts note that endorsements could provide voters with more useful information in a primary when there may be a broader mix of new and familiar options. In a general election, if the candidates are more well-established, endorsements could be less likely to offer novel insights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“That was a different environment because that was a primary election between Democrats where Oprah weighed in to that contest,” University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist <a href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/staff/barry-burden-2/">Barry Burden</a> previously told CBS 58, <a href="https://www.cbs58.com/news/do-celebrity-endorsements-matter#:~:text=Overall%20the%20research%20and%20history,all%20solution%2C%E2%80%9D%20Paleologes%20said.">a regional affiliate in Wisconsin</a>. “So everyone participating is essentially a Democrat or sympathetic to a Democrat and that’s where an endorsement could really matter.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That case study, though, shows how a prominent celebrity could wield their cachet. They might strengthen a candidate’s connection with a specific age group or demographic, and they could help pique people’s interest.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you suddenly see it in your social media feed or on TikTok or wherever, and see your favorite celebrity has done an interview or had a conversation with a politician, that politician is much more likely to get traction just by having that entry into people’s attention spans,” <a href="https://www.nulondon.ac.uk/faculty/josephine-harmon/">Josephine Harmon</a>, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University in London, previously told <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2024/07/10/celebrity-election-endorsements/">Northeastern Global News</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyoncé’s endorsement could bolster Harris’s credibility among her listeners and add to her appeal given the singer’s popularity and clout. A fan who was already leaning Democrat could be motivated to register to vote, or attend a rally, because of her endorsement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Swift’s September endorsement made some of these effects clear. Following <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/taylor-swift-voter-registration.html">Swift’s Instagram endorsement of Harris</a>, which urged people to register to vote<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/us/politics/taylor-swift-voter-registration.html">,</a> 406,000 people clicked on the link to Vote.gov, which directs people to different state voting websites. It’s not clear how many followed through with their registrations, but the spike in interest, alone, was notable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyoncé, given her sizable following and reach (she boasts 314 million Instagram followers to Swift’s 283 million), could well have a comparable effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/362300/kamala-harris-meme-brat-summer">Charli xcx memes</a> to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mxwlch03/video/7394583648571313424?q=kamala%20charli%20xcx&amp;t=1724087690722">fan-made</a> covers interpolating her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mindyrose7/video/7394876881708780842?q=america%20has%20a%20problem%20kamala&amp;t=1724087650306">famous “coconut tree” quote</a>, Kamala Harris’s last-minute presidential bid against Republican candidate Donald Trump has had a fascinating and outsized relationship with pop music.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Various progressive singers, like <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/kamala-harris-president-katy-perry-ariana-grande-jamie-lee-curtis-b2583697.html">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/olivia-rodrigo-kamala-harris-reproductive-rights-1236082554/">Olivia Rodrigo</a>, have pledged their support. Katy Perry <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/katy-perry-hopes-kamalas-run-for-president-can-save-womans-world">offered</a> one of her latest singles, “Woman’s World,” for the current vice president to use in her campaign, though Harris doesn’t seem to have taken her up on it. Meanwhile, Harris’s staff has found ways to use pop music to attract Gen Z voters, having <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/megan-thee-stallion-performs-mamushi-body-kamala-harris-atlanta-rally-1235743523/">Megan Thee Stallion</a> perform at an Atlanta rally and fully embracing brat memes. This onslaught of memes and coconut-themed “remixes” has almost overshadowed the most crucial music-related decision involved in Harris’s candidacy: her campaign song.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last month, it was <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/beyonce-kamala-harris-campaign-freedom-rcna163599">reported</a> that Beyoncé permitted the Harris (now Harris-Walz) campaign to use her song “Freedom” featuring Kendrick Lamar. Since then, the rousing gospel-tinged anthem from her 2016 album<em> Lemonade</em> has soundtracked Harris’s rally entrances and will inevitably be heard several times at this week’s Democratic National Convention. On the last day of the DNC, there was even speculation that Beyoncé herself could make an appearance. While the singer was ultimately a no-show, their long-awaited public team-up is finally happening at a Harris rally on October 25 in Houston, where she’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/24/beyonce-kamala-harris-houston-rally/">reportedly slated to perform</a>. Following her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/05/im-with-her-beyonce-and-jay-z-back-hillary-clinton-in-battleground-state-of-ohio">last-minute joining of Hillary Clinton</a> on the campaign trail in 2016, the impact of Beyoncé’s presence will be fascinating to see.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The modern campaign song has become its own character — and target of inspection — in election politics. Most of these songs have already achieved popularity outside of the campaign trail, so they need to be vital enough to re-energize constituents. They also have to be memorable and on message, embodying the values and promises of the candidate. But are they actually useful? What does it mean for a song to belong to a campaign?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Post-Trump, pop music is also something that Democrats have been able to leverage against the right — not just big hits themselves but endorsements from the artists who make them. Conversely, there’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicians_who_oppose_Donald_Trump%27s_use_of_their_music">Wikipedia page of musicians</a> who have opposed Trump’s use of their music on the campaign trail, in addition to opposing him as president. However, the results of the 2016 presidential election have made the public <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/election-celebrities-trump-clinton-endorsements-beyonce-springsteen-david-jackson-bowling-green/507383/">second-guess</a> the power of pop music in this sphere.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite this skepticism, Dana Gorzelany-Mostak, an associate professor of music at Georgia College, argues that music can be an effective medium for politicians. “While it might not drive people to the polls, music models ways of being in the world and connecting with others,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-621629084.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.63457185461,100,76.730856290779" alt="Beyoncé onstage in a black suit with white polka dots, blonde hair flying." title="Beyoncé onstage in a black suit with white polka dots, blonde hair flying." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Beyoncé performing at a Get Out The Vote concert for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on November 4, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For a campaign like Harris’s that has mostly trafficked in <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366368/tim-walz-vibes-memes-vice-president">“good vibes”</a> and likability over discussions about policy — the vice president just unveiled her policy agenda — Harris’s campaign playlist provides an interesting window into what she represents and which populations she’s counting on for support. As Jonquilyn Hill wrote for Vox, Harris’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/367288/kamala-harris-beyonce-press-silence-campaign">proximity to Beyoncé</a> may even signal how she plans to conduct herself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I spoke to Gorzelany-Mostak to get more insight into Harris’s musical selections and the overall function of campaign songs. Her book, <em><a href="https://press.umich.edu/Books/T/Tracks-on-the-Trail">Tracks on the Trail: Popular Music, Race, and the US Presidency</a></em>, published last year, charts notable campaign songs and how these musical moments are used to articulate race.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>When did presidential campaign songs really become a thing?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The election of 1840 was a watershed moment for the campaign song. The&nbsp;supporters of Whig candidate William Henry Harrison promoted singing as a campaign-worthy activity, and they published small booklets called “songsters” with pro-Harrison lyrics. These candidate-inspired lyrics were set to the popular tunes of the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What goes into picking a campaign song? Is the candidate even directly involved in this process?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It varies depending on the campaign. In 2008, Barack Obama’s staffers had the candidate’s music tastes in mind when selecting his playlist. There was continuity between the artists he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/25/barackobama.uselections2008">discussed in interviews</a> on the trail and his rally playlist, which included Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Stevie Wonder, and the Isley Brothers. Donald Trump is known to select his own soundtrack for campaign rallies, and when off the clock, he “spins” from his iPad at Mar-a-Lago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What&nbsp;is the function of a campaign song, and why do campaign songs matter?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Candidates use music to constitute their identity in sound, to sonically construct themselves in a way that appeals to the public as well as offers insight into their character and their beliefs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A campaign song is more than its lyrics. Candidates need to think about the myriad ways songs might signal messages in political contexts. This means taking into consideration the artist’s biography, the composition and character of the artist’s fan communities, the connotations attached to the song’s genre, and of course, the meanings a song has accrued through its presence in other media. While pundits may privilege the spoken word or images, sound and music can be just as powerful persuaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, campaign music preaches to the choir. I don’t think it converts people or drives them away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In </strong><strong><em>Tracks on the Trail</em></strong><strong>, you write about candidates&nbsp;articulating race through music. What do you think&nbsp;Kamala Harris is trying to convey by choosing songs, both formerly and&nbsp;currently, by high-profile Black women?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Black female artists form the backbone of Harris’s 2024 rally playlist — Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Lizzo, Megan Thee Stallion. Harris elevates a matrilineal paradigm of Black excellence that spans 60 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a notable contrast to the classic-rock-dominated Republican National Convention last month, which featured a band of aging male rockers playing covers of the Eagles, Kenny Loggins, Grand Funk Railroad, Steely Dan, and the Doobie Brothers. Trump has questioned Harris’s leadership cred and her racial identity, so Harris uses her soundtrack to disrupt this narrative by leaning into the very identity that he critiques.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Harris’s previous campaign song, Mary J.Blige’s “Work That,” is a lot more light-hearted and fun, in tone and message, compared to Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” which is a more austere, urgent song. How do you think these songs reflect the differences in those campaigns or even the broader political climate?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Freedom” does convey a certain level of urgency. But more broadly, Harris’s playlist reminds voters that they can acknowledge the country’s painful history, commit to the serious work that needs to be done, but still sing, laugh, and dance along with her on the path to victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of Harris’s playlist is composed of dance music, from Diana Ross and The Brothers Johnson to Dua Lipa and Bruno Mars, not to mention the more recent sounds of Charli xcx. To folks on the right, disco might signal the dangers of hedonism. But a genre that finds its roots in the leisure culture of Latinx, Black, and gay communities, it also points to a rich history of resistance and hope — even though these sounds have long since been domesticated, as evidenced by their presence on your mother’s gym playlist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is not surprising that some of the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mxwlch03/video/7394583648571313424?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">videos</a> of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xcx.archive/video/7394640702946250014?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">Harris</a> set to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jqsids/video/7394543209814248737?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">Charli xcx</a>’s music show the candidate laughing, dancing, or mid-gaffe — Trump himself has even <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2024/08/18/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-presidential-election-latest-news/">criticized Harris’s laughter</a>. By infusing her playlist with unfettered expressions of joy and pleasure that are Black, queer, and/or female-centered, Harris manages to wrest the reins away from the male-centric gerontocracy, if only on the dance floor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I find there’s a&nbsp;dissonance between the breezy, light-hearted tone of Harris’s campaign and the way it has been memed by Gen Z with the austerity of a song like “Freedom” — not to mention, “Freedom” is hardly one of Beyoncé’s most popular songs. Do you think this choice is a misstep?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite its more austere tone, I do think “Freedom” is a good fit for Harris. It brings together a lot of narratives that align with her campaign message and the presidential brand she is trying to cultivate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Freedom” adopts an almost prayerful tone in its adoption of gospel signifiers and its textual reference to the spiritual “Wade in the Water.” In the spiritual, water represents the possibility for escape in times of enslavement. In “Freedom,” water also comes in the form of “rain” and “tears.” This alludes to the aftermath of Beyoncé’s personal turmoil and the cultural trauma of New Orleans post-hurricane and of Black communities impacted by mass incarceration. The song also samples the voices of a mid-century prisoner and preacher, and Jay Z’s grandmother opening up about her own hardship in 2015.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In choosing “Freedom,” Harris is situating herself and the 2024 election in the lineage and the sound world of these transhistorical struggles, both personal and political.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It seems like Beyoncé&#8217;s co-sign is maybe more powerful than the song itself.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyoncé herself is a symbol of feminine power, endurance, and vitality. Her music defies categorization. She writes her own rules and regularly reinvents herself. So it’s no surprise that Harris wants to align herself with such a narrative as she embarks on her own reinvention from prosecutor to district attorney, to attorney general, to senator, to vice president, to president of the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, October 25, 11:30 am ET: </em></strong><em>This story was originally published on August 20 and has been updated to include a report by the Washington Post that Beyonce is expected to perform at Harris’s rally in Houston.</em></p>

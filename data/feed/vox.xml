<p class="has-text-align-none">Earth is heating up to record-high temperatures because humanity keeps burning coal, oil, and natural gas to fly, drive, stay warm, grow food, and keep the lights on. But switching away from these fuels toward energy sources that don’t spew heat-trapping gases while meeting the needs of 8.5 billion and counting residents of this planet will require an enormous amount of new construction: mines, factories, ports, transmission lines, power plants, substations, grid batteries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And to do that, the government will have to give the go-ahead to many, many more projects than it’s doing now, and at a much faster clip.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“If you care about the environment or you care about climate change, the status quo is not good,” said <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/person/xan-fishman/">Xan Fishman</a>, senior director of the energy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “We need to build all the clean new energy to transmission in order to both provide affordable electricity energy to Americans and reduce emissions.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The only way to do that,” he said, “is to build a lot of stuff.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lawmakers are well aware of the problem and have been trying to speed things up for more than a decades, with piecemeal advances like executive orders from the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/08/31/presidential-memorandum-speeding-infrastructure-development-through-more">White House</a> and bipartisan legislation from <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-bill/280">Congress</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The latest effort is the <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/manchin-barrasso-release-bipartisan-energy-permitting-reform-legislation">Energy Permitting Reform Act of 2024</a>, sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin (I-WV) and John Barrasso (R-WY). It cleared the Senate energy committee last month in a <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/energy-and-natural-resources-committee-clears-manchin-barrasso-permitting-reform-legislation-pending-nomination">15-4 vote</a> and will head to the full Senate for consideration, likely after the November election. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If passed, it could drastically alter the energy landscape in the United States with a construction boom to meet pent-up demand for electrons and hydrocarbons. The legislation would also greet the next president with a shorter, smoother route to their preferred energy policies. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Democrats convene in Chicago this week to formally nominate Vice President Kamala Harris as their candidate for president, one recurring theme has been the <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/barack-obama-calls-housing-market-revolution-increase-supply-homes-1942291">desire to build more</a>. And over the past four years, lawmakers have allocated billions of dollars to clean energy and supply chains through the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22772701/biden-infrastructure-law-environmental-funding">2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law</a>, the <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2022/7/27/23277664/chips-act-solve-chip-shortage-biden-manufacturing">2022 CHIPS and Science Act</a>, and the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2022/8/8/23296951/inflation-reduction-act-biden-democrats-climate-change">2022 Inflation Reduction Act</a>. The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/11/fact-sheet-the-presidents-budget-creates-good-paying-clean-jobs-cuts-energy-costs-and-delivers-on-the-presidents-ambitious-climate-agenda/">Biden White House</a> has called this “the most ambitious climate, conservation, and environmental justice agenda in history.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But many of the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/afb729b9-9641-42b2-97ca-93974c461c4c">projects have hit delays</a>, running into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/19/technology/semiconductor-chip-factories-delays.html">shortages of skilled workers</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/17/business/critical-minerals-shortage-clean-energy/index.html">critical materials</a>, and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/03/28/ev-charging-stations-slow-rollout/">limited experience in deploying the funds</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s legacy — and Harris’s ability to build on it, if she wins the White House — could crumble if the government doesn’t figure out a way to vastly expand the suite of renewable and clean energy sources that could <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24139383/climate-change-peak-greenhouse-gas-emissions-action">alter the course</a> for the <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/">world’s largest historical emitter</a> of greenhouse gases.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The challenge is that permitting is an expensive, tedious, and time-consuming process, sometimes <a href="https://www.wsj.com/video/series/wsj-explains/inside-the-decadeslong-permit-process-holding-back-10000-energy-projects/ECA61950-48C1-4347-BDD3-78B647D8C038">stretching decades</a>. Developers often find there’s a lack of accountability between the local, state, and federal authorities that have a say in granting approval for things like wind energy farms or interstate power transmission lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The current system puts a lot of project developers in a frustrating limbo — not a “no,” not a “yes,” but a “maybe, we’ll see” that can stretch indefinitely. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This uncertainty makes it harder for companies to make a business case and often leads to proposals falling apart. The net result is that few things get built at all. In the past decade, the United States has built transmission lines at <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-final-transmission-permitting-rule-and-latest">half the rate as in the 30 years prior</a>. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included $7.5 billion to build thousands of electric vehicle charging stations, yet <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/03/28/ev-charging-stations-slow-rollout/">only a handful are operating</a>. The American Clean Power Association, an industry group, reports that permitting delays have cost the US economy <a href="https://cleanpower.org/resources/u-s-permitting-delays-hold-back-economy-cost-jobs/">more than $100 billion in lost investment</a>. Earlier this year, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory <a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/news/larg-e-scale-wind-and-solar">surveyed wind and solar power developers</a> and found that one-third of permit applications for placing wind turbines and solar panels in the ground were canceled over the past five years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These false starts cost businesses a lot of money: The average sunk cost was more than $2 million on average for a canceled solar project and $7.5 million for a scrapped wind farm. The main causes cited for these axed proposals were difficulties in getting approvals from zoning boards, in connecting to the power grid, and opposition from local communities — all issues that inhibit permitting.  </p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That brings us to permitting reform. The idea is to change the existing system of rules — smoothing out the application process, setting tighter deadlines, reducing veto points — to get a verdict on projects faster. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Manchin-Barrasso bill contains provisions that benefit clean energy, like speeding up approvals for more power transmission. This is essential to expanding renewable energy, but also makes it easier to extract more coal, oil, and natural gas. The bill also contains specific provisions aimed to increase fossil fuel exports, which has raised the ire of some environmental groups.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bill’s authors acknowledge that this is a compromise. The concession will undermine some of the benefits of deploying more renewable energy. However, having both fossil and renewable energy provisions in the Manchin-Barrasso bill helped it secure votes from both parties. “Let me be clear: There’s no such thing as a perfect bill. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good,” Sen. Manchin said during a <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/energy-and-natural-resources-committee-clears-manchin-barrasso-permitting-reform-legislation-pending-nomination">hearing last month on the permitting reform proposal</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The critical questions are whether this iteration of permitting reform will do more harm than good, and what the next administration will do with a faster process if the bill is signed into law.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What the new Manchin-Barrasso permitting reform bill aims to do</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Any time a developer wants to build something — particularly on public land, stretching across state lines, or destined for another country — it needs government approval. And to get a thumbs-up, the builders need to demonstrate that the project is safe, that it serves the public interest, that it doesn’t cost taxpayers too much, and that it doesn’t cause undue harm to the environment. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“One of the reasons it’s been difficult to solve our permitting processes is because it’s not just one problem,” Fishman said. “A lot of different things that create frictions in the mix.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the federal level, one of the most important regulations governing energy is the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/nepa/what-national-environmental-policy-act">1969 National Environmental Policy Act</a> (NEPA). It’s a well-intentioned law that strives for “productive harmony” between projects and their potential impacts and requires the government to consider how proposals to build highways, bridges, power lines, and dams will affect rivers, forests, air pollution, and endangered species. The review process then leads to the creation of a document called an <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/publications/teaching-legal-docs/teaching-legal-docs--what-is-an-environmental-impact-statement-/">environmental impact statement</a> (EIS), which serves as a basis for making decisions about a given project at all levels of government.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The trouble is that simply doing the research needed to write an EIS can take years and the resulting document can be unwieldy. A 2020 White House analysis found that the <a href="https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/nepa-practice/CEQ_EIS_Length_Report_2020-6-12.pdf">average draft EIS</a> was 575 pages long and took <a href="https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/nepa-practice/CEQ_EIS_Timeline_Report_2020-6-12.pdf">4.5 years to complete</a>. And for opponents of a project, an EIS can expose weaknesses in a proposal and serve as a playbook for lawsuits, creating more opportunities for delay.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For renewables, the added complication is that the power grid in many parts of the country doesn’t have the capacity to add more wind and solar energy without renovations and upgrades. Much of the US power grid was built in the 1960s and 1970s, before the advent of widespread intermittent renewables. And 70 percent of power transmission lines are approaching the ends of their life cycles, according to the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/gdo/articles/what-does-it-take-modernize-us-electric-grid">Department of Energy</a>. So clean energy developers aren’t just waiting on permits for their own hardware; they need a green light to augment the power grid as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Right now, there’s so much clean energy that wants to connect to the grid, and the interconnection queue is long because there’s not enough transmission to carry that energy from where it can be produced to where the consumers are that can use it,” Fishman said. By <a href="https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Transmission_2022-09-22.pdf">one estimate</a>, if the transmission line expansion holds at current languorous rates, up to 80 percent of the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from the Inflation Reduction Act would be lost. </p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the permitting reform bill will speed up energy development</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">The Energy Permitting Reform Act has several major provisions to boost renewable energy:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>It sets a 150-day statute of limitations for filing a lawsuit to challenge an energy project once it has been approved.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Federal agencies like the Interior Department, the Agriculture Department, and the Energy Department have firm deadlines for approving or denying applications.</li>



<li>There’s a target of deploying 50 gigawatts of renewable energy on federal lands by 2030.</li>



<li>The bill harmonizes regional and national project review standards.</li>



<li>Agencies have to waive certain review requirements under NEPA for infrastructure around smaller geothermal energy projects.</li>



<li>Transmission projects also get some carve-outs from the NEPA process if they follow existing routes.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The Interior Department must offer at least five lease sales for offshore wind each year, with a goal of building 30 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2030.</li>



<li>The bill removes some of the regulatory barriers preventing renewables from connecting to the power grid.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p class="has-text-align-none">However, some of these provisions also accelerate fossil fuel<em> </em>development. In addition, the bill contains measures that directly benefit energy sources like coal, oil, and natural gas:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Energy Department has 90 days to rule on approving a natural gas export facility after it has completed the NEPA process.</li>



<li>Land that’s cleared for renewable energy installations must also be open to fossil fuel leasing.</li>



<li>The Interior Department must hold at least one auction per year for offshore oil and gas drilling rights.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Manchin-Barrasso bill addresses these obstacles to clean energy development in several ways. It replaces the open-ended project review process at federal agencies with deadlines, shrinks the window for filing lawsuits against a project, and sets targets for deploying more renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the measures that accelerate approvals for wind and solar power also clear the route for coal, oil, and natural gas. Major portions of the bill are also targeted specifically at fossil fuels, like requiring the Interior Department to auction leases for on- and offshore oil and gas extraction.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why some groups oppose the permitting reform bill, and why it’s still not enough</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is the trade-off worth it? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fishman noted that there are currently nearly three times as many renewable energy projects in the pipeline waiting for permits than fossil fuel proposals, so unblocking the logjam would likely be a net benefit for the climate. The vast majority of energy being added to the grid right now <a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/clean-energy/chart-nearly-all-new-us-power-plants-built-in-2024-will-be-clean-energy">comes from zero-emissions sources</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I understand that environmentalists don’t love every element of the bill, but ​​if you look at the bill as a whole, there&#8217;s so much more to love than there is to dislike in the bill,” Fishman said. “Not accepting a bipartisan deal like this is choosing to instead accept our status quo.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, making it easier to develop more fossil fuels does run contrary to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22397364/earth-day-us-climate-change-summit-biden-john-kerry-commitment-2030-zero-emissions">US’s goals to curb its greenhouse gas emissions</a>. The US is already the <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24098983/biden-oil-production-climate-fossil-fuel-renewables">largest oil and gas producer in the world</a>. Opponents also note that the Manchin-Barrasso bill facilitates fossil fuel exports, particularly liquefied natural gas. These exports aren’t counted toward the US’s carbon footprint since other countries end up buying and burning the fuel.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, the Biden administration put a <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24055711/lng-export-pause-biden-liquefied-natural-gas-climate-change">pause on approvals for new LNG export terminals</a> pending a review from the Energy Department. Even with the pause, the US is on track to double its LNG exports by 2030.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The permitting reform bill will hit “play” on even more LNG shipped abroad. “Our bill permanently ends President Biden’s so-called ‘pause’ on new American LNG exports,” Sen Barrasso said in a <a href="https://www.energy.senate.gov/2024/7/barrasso-permitting-reform-act-will-boost-american-energy-production-lower-costs-for-families">hearing last month</a>. “President Biden’s ‘pause’ has been a gift to Russia and Qatar — the world’s other leading LNG exporters.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the bill doesn’t guarantee that an agency will rule one way or another on an export license, it does shift the balance toward approval. “This bill is written to set [the Energy Department’s] default to ‘yes’ and make sure that these massive LNG facilities are built,” said <a href="https://www.symonspa.com/jeremy-symons-principal">Jeremy Symons</a>, who used to work on the Senate environment committee and is now principal at Symons Public Affairs, an environmental consulting firm. “You can’t sling climate pollution over the fence and expect it to just go away.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Symons conducted an <a href="https://www.symonspa.com/post/assessing-the-climate-impacts-of-the-manchin-barrasso-bill-s-lng-title">analysis of the LNG export section of the bill</a> and found that it would lead to greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 165 coal-fired power plants and undo the benefits of dozens of major transmission lines for renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A confounding factor is that LNG is cleaner than some fossil fuels but worse for the environment than renewables. The <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-what-does-bidens-lng-pause-mean-for-global-emissions/">net impact to the climate</a> depends on whether the exported LNG is displacing coal and oil or if it’s competing with wind, solar, and nuclear power. It’s unclear how this will shake out, since exports are also governed by market and geopolitical forces. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The permitting reform bill is also not meant to solve all the problems with getting the go-ahead for building out energy production and infrastructure. While it enforces timelines for making decisions based on NEPA reviews, it doesn’t make any changes to NEPA itself. Though it addresses the federal government’s role in permitting, a lot of the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/eight-facts-about-permitting-and-the-clean-energy-transition/">hold-ups for renewables are at the state and regional levels</a>.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, the bill has built up some momentum and it might come up for a vote after the election. If Biden signs it, it will be a fitting coda to <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/362478/joe-biden-climate-change-legacy">his environmental legacy</a>, a big jump forward that then takes several steps back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just like the opening of Jennifer Lopez’s movie musical <em>This Is Me… Now —</em> where the multihyphenate’s unnamed character and the mysterious love of her life (played by and representing Ben Affleck) are thrown from a motorcycle in a crash that symbolically breaks her heart — the real Jennifer Lopez <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/jennifer-lopez-files-divorce-ben-affleck-after-2/story?id=111512204">has filed for divorce</a> from the real Ben Affleck. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The split comes after months of <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/553756/jennifer-lopez-responds-to-reporters-question-about-divorce-from-ben-affleck-watch/">tabloid</a> scrutiny and anonymously <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/ben-affleck-hides-hand-in-his-sweatshirt-amid-jennifer-lopez-drama/">sourced</a> stories that the two were headed for separation. Lopez and Affleck were reportedly living separately and extremely unhappy with being married to each other. He allegedly wants a life away from the spotlight, and she can’t stop living in it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If this all sounds familiar, it’s because it’s all eerily similar to what happened 20 years ago when the couple, known as Bennifer, first broke up. After a magnetic first meeting on a movie set, the two began dating and quickly became one of the most sought-after celebrity couples. Gossip rags and paparazzi were there to capture their every breath. The couple eventually called it quits, blaming the outsize media attention for their demise. And now it feels like we’re once again back at the original Bennifer breakup. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bennifer isn’t the first celebrity couple nor will they be the last, but they represent something rare<strong> </strong>in Hollywood:<strong> </strong>a real — and really dramatic — relationship. Something that wasn’t made for PR, but captures so, so much of it.<strong> </strong>They are two very famous people in love who have tried to live and love authentically in an industry where that’s extremely risky. Their relationship also reflects our fixation with realness and relatability: If they didn’t have either, we wouldn’t be so engrossed by them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given the current media fervor, here’s a look at what the two represent — solo, together, split — that makes us so obsessed with them some 20 years later.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The complete relationship timeline of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, a.k.a. Bennifer</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>December 2001–November 2002: The birth of Bennifer</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Affleck and Lopez meet on the set of <em>Gigli</em>, which begins shooting in December 2001. Originally, Halle Berry had been offered Lopez’s role, but had to drop out due to scheduling conflict with 2003’s <em>X-Men</em> sequel <em>X2</em>. Lopez is married to backup dancer Chris Judd at the time, but files for <a href="https://ew.com/article/2002/07/26/j-lo-files-divorce/">divorce in summer 2002</a>, ending their 10-month marriage. Lopez and Affleck officially begin dating shortly after.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The media refers to the couple as “Bennifer,” a combination of their first names. Allegedly, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/kevin-smith-on-coining-bennifer-and-trying-to-save-his-hero-stan-lee?source=entertainment&amp;via=rss">director Kevin Smith coined</a> the portmanteau while directing the two on the set of his movie <em>Jersey Girl</em>. Bennifer starts a trend of the media bestowing celebrity couples with mashed-up nicknames like Brangelina (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) and TomKat (Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On November 5, 2002, Lopez premieres her music video for “Jenny From the Block” on <em>TRL</em>. The video stars Affleck, and is about how Lopez and Affleck can’t find any privacy. They’re hounded by paparazzi at every turn. The video is also a flex because they are styled elegantly and doing glamorous things like hanging out on a yacht and lounging by the pool with a bottle of champagne. The gist: Everyone wants a piece of them because they’re the It couple.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>November 10, 2002: Bennifer’s engaged&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an exclusive interview with <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=132029&amp;page=1">ABC News’s Diane Sawyer</a>, Lopez confirms that she and Affleck are engaged. At first, Lopez plays coy, telling Sawyer that the two were very “secure” in their relationship. According to ABC News, Lopez calls Affleck during a break in the interview, and they decide to go on the record about their engagement. Lopez tells Sawyer that Affleck’s proposal “was traditional, but also in a very spectacular way, as of course Ben would do it.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>August 2003–January 2004: Bennifer bombs out</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Bennifer is now the most famous couple in Hollywood that isn’t married. Tabloids love them. Their wedding plans are in every magazine. Her engagement ring, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/jlo-ben-affleck-engagement-ring/index.html">a Harry Winston pink diamond</a> the size of a meteorite, seems to have its own gravitational pull. The wedding is reportedly going to be a <a href="https://nypost.com/2003/09/11/altared-state-ben-and-jen-put-off-wedding-date-2/">gigantic, multimillion-dollar</a> Hollywood affair.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plan is to tie the <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/revisit-jennifer-lopez-and-ben-afflecks-2003-wedding-plans/">knot in September</a>, right after the August release of <em>Gigli</em>, the movie the two worked on together. People ostensibly want to see <em>Gigli</em> to witness the spark that created Bennifer, captured onscreen. <em>Gigli</em>, unfortunately,<em> </em>turns out to be an awful film, one of the worst movies that a group of humans has ever created. Critics ravage the often offensive <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/culture/film/dead-ends-for-jlo-and-co-7436444.html">idiocy of the script</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/01/movies/film-review-an-offer-of-love-he-can-t-refuse.html">its flat camera work</a>, and its <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2003/08/should-ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopez-apologize-for-gigli.html">supernatural ability to bore</a>.&nbsp; It flops at the box office, bringing in only<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1012172289/"> $7 million worldwide</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Every tabloid focuses on how Bennifer was handling <em>Gigli</em>’s absolute failure. Then in early August, Affleck visits Brandi’s Exotic Nightclub in Vancouver, Canada. Reportedly Lopez is upset, but through their spokespeople, the couple says <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/jen-and-bens-very-bad-week-continues/">everything is fine</a> and that he had always planned to go to the strip club. Whispers of Lopez’s uneasiness sharpen into tabloids declaring that there is trouble in paradise, and Bennifer is rapidly deteriorating ahead of their storybook wedding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-109933234.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,2.9571638946639,100,36.282722513089" alt="Affleck and Lopez looking at each other on the red carpet, as they stand close, with Affleck&#039;s arm wrapped around her waist." title="Affleck and Lopez looking at each other on the red carpet, as they stand close, with Affleck&#039;s arm wrapped around her waist." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez at the &lt;em&gt;Gigli&lt;/em&gt; premiere in 2003. | Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic" data-portal-copyright="Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Days before the ceremony, post-<em>Gigli</em> and post-Brandi’s, the couple sends an announcement officially postponing their nuptials. “Due to the excessive media attention surrounding our wedding, we have decided to postpone the date,” <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101039&amp;page=1">Lopez and Affleck say</a> in a joint statement. “We felt what should have been a joyful and sacred day could be spoiled for us, our families and our friends.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The couple officially calls it quits in January 2004.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>January 2004–April 2021: The solo days (kind of)</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Apart, the couple moves on. Lopez marries singer Marc Anthony in June 2004; the two have twins in 2008, but divorce in 2014. In 2019, she gets engaged to former Yankee Alex Rodriguez, breaking up in early 2021. As of early 2021, her career is on the up, as she stars in <em>Hustlers</em> and performs at the Super Bowl.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Affleck marries actor Jennifer Garner (a Bennifer reboot, of sorts, with new casting) in June 2005, and they have three children. After his public struggles with alcoholism, their divorce is finalized in 2018. Affleck’s career over this period is a little more uneven, with high highs and low lows — <em>Argo</em>, which he directed, wins the Best Picture Oscar in 2012, but he also becomes <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22238820/sad-ben-affleck-ana-de-armas-cardboard-cutout">the reluctant hero of inescapable, existential sadness</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>&nbsp;April 2021: Bennifer reunites</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In April 2021 — the same month that Lopez and Alex Rodriguez <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/see-alex-rodriguezs-cryptic-posts-following-split-from-jennifer-lopez/">announce</a> they’ve broken up — the pair reunite, reportedly <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-ben-affleck-tabloid-timeline">after</a> Affleck provides a glowing quote for an <a href="https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/jennifer-lopez/may-2021-cover">InStyle profile</a> about Lopez.&nbsp;<a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/05/11/inside-ben-affleck-and-jennifer-lopezs-romantic-montana-getaway/">Lopez visits Affleck in Montana</a> in early May, which is a big deal because that is allegedly one of Affleck’s most favorite places on Earth. According to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2021/05/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-vacation-montana-intense-chemistry-reconciliation-vax-live">unnamed sources</a>, the reunion between the two is intense and the chemistry between Lopez and Affleck is, like the first time, indescribably strong.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The public is <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22629442/bennifer-jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-reunion-explained">rooting</a> for the Bennifer reunion. Perhaps it’s the post-pandemic-lockdown earnestness or remorse over the general schadenfreude we seemed to feel at the end of Bennifer 1.0, but there’s a feeling that these two are good for each other. Her resurgent success is just what Sad Affleck needs. Post-A-Rod, Sad Affleck’s secluded life is just what Lopez needs. In a world that doesn’t make much sense, Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez being together does.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>April 2022–February 2023: Bennifer engaged (again) and finally married&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Around a year after Bennifer reunite, the pair informs the public — <a href="https://people.com/movies/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-are-engaged/">via People</a> — that they are engaged in April 2022. Lopez <a href="https://x.com/JLo/status/1512610660026257409">also teases</a> the news in her personal newsletter OnTheJLo. A few months later, in July, the two marry <a href="https://www.laineygossip.com/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-subverted-expectations-this-weekend-with-surprise-casual-wedding-in-vegas/71329">in Las Vegas</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The wedding is the complete opposite of the one the couple postponed and never had 18 years earlier. Instead of a full-blown, glitzy affair, the ceremony happened on a seemingly random Saturday in Sin City, taking the public by surprise. The small, unannounced, private nuptials seem to symbolically suggest that Affleck and Lopez realized the deleterious effects of media hoopla from 2004 — that they have grown up and are doing things on their own terms. The wedding adds to the idea that, this time, Bennifer are two people who have learned lessons about love and life and are determined to make it work. They seem more destined than ever.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In August, the two have a <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a40887916/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-marry-georgia-ceremony/">second wedding ceremony</a> in Georgia.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We moved in together, the kids moved in together, so it’s been like a really kind of emotional transition,” Lopez <a href="https://people.com/movies/jennifer-lopez-says-its-been-an-emotional-transition-after-moving-in-with-husband-ben-affleck/">tells</a> People about her 2022. “But at the same time &#8230;  all your dreams coming true, it’s just been a phenomenal year.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>February 2023–February 2024: The honeymoon phase</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The way Affleck makes Lopez happy and Lopez makes Affleck happy seems to be reflected in their public-facing personas. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQgCl_MAgBM">Affleck lands a Dunkin’</a> gig consisting of commercials that poke fun at his New England grump image (one includes <a href="https://www.today.com/food/ben-affleck-pop-star-dunkin-donuts-commercial-2024-rcna137100">Lopez</a>). Sad Affleck would never make fun of himself like this. Only happy men have fun at their own expense. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jennifer-lopez-launches-jlo-beauty-301199839.html">Lopez not only launches and maintains a beauty line</a>, but also begins work on an opus, seemingly ready to build upon the momentum from <em>Hustlers</em> and the Super Bowl.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>February 2024: This Is Them… Now</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The way Ben Affleck’s breath smells after drinking Dunkin’ coffee, the exact shade of his phoenix tattoo when it’s hit by the Los Angeles afternoon sun, the way his voice shifts up an octave when he talks about the funny thing Matt Damon just did — these are some of the intimate secrets that maybe only Jennifer Lopez will ever know. But if you ever wanted to know how loving Ben Affleck makes Jennifer Lopez feel, Lopez’s three-part <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24075110/jennifer-lopez-movie-this-is-me-now-love-story-review"><em>This Is Me… Now</em></a> multimedia experience exists to be consumed.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In an album and a movie musical adaptation of the album (titled<em> This Is Me&#8230; Now: A Love Story</em>),<strong> </strong>Lopez figures her love affair with Affleck like a myth from the ancient world: She compares them to Alida and Taroo, lovers from a Puerto Rican legend separated by fate and feuding families.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her first breakup with Affleck is reflected in a physically catastrophic motorcycle crash that breaks Lopez’s “heart factory,” a steampunk-styled industrial foundry full of workers whose job it is to feed Lopez’s mechanical organ rose petals so that she can continue to love. With the help of a zodiac council (featuring Jane Fonda as Sagittarius), archetypal friends, a therapist played by Fat Joe, and a visit to the Bronx where Lopez meets her younger self and a hummingbird, her romantic cardiac complex is restored.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With her heart machine full of rose petals, Lopez is ready to love Affleck when he enters her life again. Because she loves him now with a full understanding of herself, the motorcycle — the avatar of their love — does not crash.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, Lopez releases the movie’s documentary accompaniment, <em>The Greatest Love Story Never Told — </em>all about the money she spent to tell us how in love she is with Ben Affleck.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As Lopez explains, she had to spend roughly $20 million of her own money to make the film because studios and streamers were not interested in the allegorical retelling of her marriage. The doc, which <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/jlo-and-the-greatest-love-story-never-told-review-famous-and-owning-it">some critics</a> say is an example of Lopez’s blazing narcissism, makes a case that the only thing that Lopez loves more than Affleck is being able to tell the world about Affleck.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lopez doesn’t seem to care whether that is what the world wants from her.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It’s not like anyone is clamoring for the next J.Lo record,” Lopez tells the camera person in a moment of blistering self-awareness, before using the film’s other 85 minutes to spend a small fortune to not only give people that record, but an album and two films that no one is “clamoring” for.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-2009263294.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.9750621103455,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez attend the 2024 Los Angeles premiere of &lt;em&gt;This Is Me... Now: A Love Story&lt;/em&gt;. | Monica Schipper/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Monica Schipper/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">The most prescient and icy observation in the film, though, belongs to Affleck. It’s about his wife’s need for fame. He likens her constant performance — whether it’s acting, singing, dancing, playing the Super Bowl halftime show, or even making this documentary —&nbsp;to an addiction.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The thing you discover, like you do &#8230; with alcohol, is that there isn’t enough alcohol in all the liquor stores in the world to fill up that thing,” he says, astutely connecting Lopez’s need for celebrity to his own battle with <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24075110/jennifer-lopez-movie-this-is-me-now-love-story-review">drinking</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“And I think in Jennifer’s case, I don’t think there’s enough followers or — or movies or records or any of that stuff — to still that part of you,” he adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While promoting her films, Lopez talks about her reservations about having Affleck participate in the doc. He had told her that revealing so much of her personal life was not a choice he would make. She says that including him in the doc and showing his personal feelings — like that addiction comparison — was frightening but necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I told him he was crazy, not me. But I know that I’m a crazy one. I get that part,” <a href="https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-reluctant-participant-greatest-love-never-told-documentary-8600797">she tells a Los Angeles audience</a> in February. “But I really feel like as an artist, you have to be vulnerable. You have to, even when you’re playing a role, have to get down to the real parts of yourself to share what it’s like to be human. And that is a scary thing to do.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lopez’s multimedia art project turns out to be a bust. Even though the movie musical received surprisingly <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/this_is_me_now_a_love_story">good reviews</a>, it failed to have a lasting impact. The album is the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/03/01/jennifer-lopezs-new-album-is-the-lowest-charting-of-her-career/?sh=6ae773f054df">lowest charting</a> one of her career, and her accompanying arena tour suffered dismal ticket sales. As <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/jennifer-lopez-this-is-me-now-tour-greatest-hits-rebrand-1235958543/">Variety reports</a>, Lopez rebranded the concert as a greatest hits show in an effort to sell more seats. The timing of Lopez’s magnum opus flopping&nbsp;is strangely akin to the way <em>Gigli</em> took a nosedive when Affleck and Lopez were together in 2004.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>May 2024: Bennifer separation rumors begin (again)</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the celebrity tabloid world, people are paid to watch certain famous people’s every move. According to a <a href="https://people.com/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-not-photographed-together-publicly-47-days-8649895">People magazine report</a> this month, Bennifer has not been photographed together for 47 days. There are also <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a60868051/why-jennifer-lopez-is-upset-with-ben-affleck/">reports</a> that the two are currently living apart, and even though <a href="https://www.etonline.com/ben-affleck-feels-like-jennifer-lopez-has-a-hard-time-feeling-satisfied-source-says-225881">Lopez was recently photographed</a> with a wedding ring on, the undertone was that she was doing it to hopefully quash the insistent rumors that they’re going through a rough patch.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Through a variety of unnamed sources, the problem between the two is, once again, the ongoing attention from the media. A source told Entertainment Tonight that Affleck feels as though his wife is too engaged with being a celebrity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Ben feels like Jen has a hard time feeling satisfied and that’s one of the issues they’re facing,” the anonymous <a href="https://www.etonline.com/ben-affleck-feels-like-jennifer-lopez-has-a-hard-time-feeling-satisfied-source-says-225881">source told ET</a>. “Ben is one of the only people who feels comfortable enough to be honest and real with Jen. It’s part of why Jen loves him, but also why she’s upset with him.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That quote is extremely similar to what Affleck said in the documentary: that no amount of attention or praise is ever going to be enough for his wife. It’s also aligned with the ongoing narrative about Affleck and Lopez. He wants a quiet life away from the spotlight. She wants to be a star.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/gettyimages-2121052565.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are seen out and about on March 30, 2024. There haven&#039;t been as many pictures of them together since. | MEGA/GC Images via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="MEGA/GC Images via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Another anonymous source echoed that statement <a href="https://people.com/ben-affleck-jennifer-lopez-marriage-not-in-best-place-exclusive-8651551">with People</a>, telling the mag: “She likes to open her heart to her fans and to the world. He is more introspective and private. This has been difficult day-to-day.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The outlook for the two doesn’t look good. <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/05/20/entertainment/ben-affleck-has-come-to-his-senses-in-jennifer-lopez-marriage/">Page Six</a> had a scathing quote from an insider, asserting that Affleck is just about done: “If there was a way to divorce on grounds of temporary insanity, he would. &#8230; He feels like the last two years were just a fever dream, and he’s come to his senses now and understands there is just no way this is going to work.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Neither Affleck nor Lopez have officially commented on the state of their relationship. Lopez was asked about divorce rumors while on a promotional tour for her sci-fi movie <em>Atlas</em>. She <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-divorce-rumours-b2550245.html">dismissed the question</a>, saying it was inappropriate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On May 31, a “heartsick” Lopez announced in <a href="https://onthejlo.com/en/home/sc2e368d4-827c-4019-8a0d-4508bbbcaa4c">her newsletter</a> that she was canceling her tour to spend more time with her kids. <a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/05/31/entertainment/jennifer-lopez-cancels-tour-to-spend-times-with-kids-amid-ben-affleck-split-rumors/">Page Six</a> reported that sources close to the singer denied that poor ticket sales were to blame for the thwarted tour, pointing instead toward the impending split from Affleck.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>August 2024: The Bennifer divorce</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After a summer of rumors, in which the couple was not photographed together, it was announced that Lopez filed for divorce from Affleck on August 20, 2024, the second anniversary of their second wedding ceremony in Georgia. News outlets obtained <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/jennifer-lopez-files-divorce-ben-affleck-after-2/story?id=111512204">documents</a> confirming the legal split, which show that Lopez filed herself — <a href="https://people.com/jennifer-lopez-unusual-divorce-filing-legal-source-exclusive-8699103">without a lawyer</a>. According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2024/08/20/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-file-divorce/">TMZ</a>, the couple did not have a prenup. Neither Lopez nor Affleck have officially commented. The divorce filing comes two years and one month after the couple’s 2022 wedding.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why we care so much about Bennifer</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hollywood is an industry where we don’t see many people genuinely be themselves. Actors make a living and win awards on how convincing they are playing someone else. From auditions to promotional tours, they’re constantly selling themselves, luring people to buy into their public personas. And while it seems like we have more access to celebrities’ personal lives than ever — everyone is on Instagram at this point — it’s an illusion that masks how curated these people’s lives are and how carefully they’re presenting themselves to the public.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The thing about Bennifer is that it genuinely feels like Affleck and Lopez do love each other in a very authentic way. After the first go-around, their agents, managers, and inner circles would have advised them against getting into a relationship because that’s not good business.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Why would someone with a logical mind risk going through another round of bad press and harsh scrutiny? Why would someone spend $20 million of their own money making a movie about getting back together? Why would someone who hates the spotlight publicly get married to one of the most famous women in the world and star in her documentary about them?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And to risk this all for it to possibly blow up in your face? Again?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That has to be love, right?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite the millions of dollars and awards and homes in Montana, this makes Bennifer strangely relatable. So many people were so invested in them getting back together because, despite the trappings, it feels like a love story that could happen to anyone: getting a second chance with your soulmate because you’ve both learned from your past mistakes. Their story is enough to make us wistful for a romance we’ve had or maybe even ones that we haven’t had yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tough times are relatable, too. While a fairytale reunion with the one that got away can be a story that resonates, so can the experience of getting back with an ex only to have it implode. Loving someone immensely is different from having a loving relationship with them. Perhaps we don’t always change and learn from our mistakes. Watching it play out with Affleck and Lopez just makes it all that much clearer. And we can’t stop watching because we need to see how it all ends.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are some mysteries that I fear I’ll never see resolved. Who was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._B._Cooper">DB Cooper</a> and what happened to him? Who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Stewart_Gardner_Museum_theft">robbed the Gardner Museum</a> of its Vermeer and Rembrandts in 1990? And, most pressingly: where are the <a href="https://www.amjtransplant.org/article/S1600-6135(23)00462-8/abstract">thousands of pancreases</a> taken out of Americans’ dead bodies in 2021, 2022, and 2023 that were never transplanted into anybody?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let me back up. Pancreata (the correct plural form of “pancreas”) are one of those organs you can’t live without. Without one, you don’t have insulin to regulate blood sugar or enzymes necessary to digest food. So all donated pancreata come from dead people who register as organ donors. In the US, we outsource the job of collecting organs from dead bodies to private groups called organ procurement organizations, or OPOs. Each OPO has a monopoly on organs in a particular geographic area; there are <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/?memberType=Organ%20Procurement%20Organizations&amp;organType=%27AL%27&amp;state=0&amp;region=0">56 groups total</a>, some of which only cover part of a state and some of which cover multiple states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For some time now, independent analysts and investigative reporters have argued that OPOs are underusing deceased donor organs by the tens of thousands. One report from 2019 estimated that every year <a href="https://www.bridgespan.org/bridgespan/Images/articles/reforming-organ-donation-in-america/reforming-organ-donation-in-america-12-2018.pdf">28,000 usable organs</a> (mostly kidneys but also pancreata, hearts, livers, etc.) from deceased donors are never used; another put <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/organ-transplant-shortages/?utm_term=.806b23dd755d">the number at 75,000</a>. This, when the national waitlist for organs is <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics">more than 100,000 people long</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, OPOs have faced perverse incentives. For instance, they were most often evaluated on the basis of how many organs are recovered per “eligible death,” but “eligible death” is a determination made by the OPOs themselves. That made it easy to juice the stats by, for instance, classifying some deaths as “ineligible” even when the organs were perfectly usable. That made “organs recovered per eligible deaths” go up without actually getting more people organs. OPO contracts with the federal government are <a href="https://archive.triblive.com/local/pittsburgh-allegheny/taxpayers-help-pay-for-organ-donor-groups-parties-rose-parade-expenses/">quite lucrative</a>, which means OPO executives have ample reason to <a href="https://www.pogo.org/investigations/heartless-organ-donation-contractors-lobby-against-a-popular-health-care-initiative-while-pocketing-pandemic-relief-loans">fight hard</a> to retain them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2019, President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/10/20687507/triump-kidney-disease-transplant">issued a quite good executive order</a> instructing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees OPOs, to change the way they’re evaluated. The order led to two new metrics that were meant to be harder to game. The rule was finalized in December 2020, and — after also being reviewed and approved by the <a href="https://www.pogo.org/investigations/americas-transformative-new-organ-donation-rule-goes-into-effect-over-objections-from-monopolistic-contractors#:~:text=The%20Centers%20for%20Medicare%20and,effective%20on%20March%2030%2C%202021.">Biden administration</a> — <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/02/02/2021-02180/medicare-and-medicaid-programs-organ-procurement-organizations-conditions-for-coverage-revisions-to">took effect in March 2021</a>. It came with real teeth: OPOs that did particularly badly would face decertification, meaning another OPO with a better track record of serving patients would take over their territory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rule had the potential to force OPOs to collect more organs and save thousands more lives every year. But the OPOs quickly figured out a new loophole.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The birth of the pancreas loophole</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rule’s new metrics were meant to be based on objective criteria. It asked OPOs to tally the total number of deceased people 75 and younger with causes of death compatible with donation, and then estimate the number of deceased donors each year as a share of that total population, and the number of organs actually used as a share of that total population. The denominator was now something that OPOs couldn’t tamper with. That meant, hopefully, that they’d be judged solely on how many organs they recovered and transplanted into people — on how many thousands of lives they saved.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while OPOs couldn’t muck with the denominator anymore, they could still muck with the numerators. Being a donor generally means that your organs are used in a transplant, but there’s a carveout for one organ: the pancreas. A <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-108publ362">narrow 2004 law</a> allows researchers running clinical trials to conduct transplants of islet cells (the parts of the pancreas that produce insulin) as a potential cure for diabetes. Because of that law, OPOs could “recover” pancreases for islet cell transplant research, and get credit for recovering more organs under the new rule. But the federal government never asked for any proof that these organs were part of any FDA-approved research.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sure enough, the total number of pancreata that OPOs labeled as for “research” grew from 513 in 2020 to a whopping 3,238 in 2023. The number of donors whose only recovered organ was a pancreas designated for research grew from 25 to 429, according to the <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/">Organ Procurement &amp; Transplantation Network</a>. That’s an over tenfold increase in three years.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="OPOs reported many more pancreas recoveries right after the government started judging them on how many organs they recovered" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QrbaT/1/" frameborder="0" height="412"></iframe>!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r&lt;e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;][t]+&quot;px&quot;;e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last year, Lenny Bernstein, a reporter at the Washington Post who’s been watching this scandal closely, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/03/20/organ-transplant-groups-pancreas-collection/">talked to pancreatic researchers</a> who all reported there was no sudden surge in need for pancreases in research projects. Indeed, if you look at the <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/?memberType=Transplant+Centers&amp;state=-1&amp;region=0">small handful of medical centers</a> that use research pancreata for islet cell transplants, you find that there were only 24 transplants conducted in all of 2023: 22 at the University of Chicago Medical Center, and one each at City of Hope Medical Center outside Los Angeles, and at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s 3,238 pancreata recovered for islet cell transplant research in 2023, and only 24 actual transplants conducted that year. Where did the other 3,214 pancreata go? Where did the nearly 7,000 pancreata taken from dead Americans’ bodies over the past three years and not used for transplants go?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The waiting list for people needing just pancreata is <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics/detailed-description#fig1">barely 800 people</a>. That number could be zero if these organs were better allocated. Where are they?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I asked the Association of Organ Procurement Organizations (AOPO), a kind of trade group for the organ procurers, for an explanation. “CMS developed and implemented the current rule governing the use of pancreata for research in 2021. As is required, OPOs have been complying with the rule since that time,” AOPO’s president Dorrie Dils told Vox in a statement. “OPOs have always followed CMS guidance and will continue to do so.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s one interpretation. Another is that we could be seeing an attempt by OPOs to get around regulations, and avoid being decertified because they don’t facilitate enough donations. That’s certainly how the <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-grassley-cardin-young-raise-alarm-over-dramatic-increase-in-pancreata-procurement-">Senate Finance Committee</a>, where a bipartisan group of senators has been investigating the matter, sees it. In a letter to OPOs sent last year, the committee quoted from a listserv of OPO employees. In a thread discussing the new rules, an OPO employee wrote, “If you have a donor with only a pancreas for research, that is an organ donor for the Donor Rate. Otherwise, a donor is any donor with at least 1 organ transplanted. Savvy (or cynical?) OPOs ought to start a pancreas for research program immediately.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Savvy (or cynical?) indeed! In a <a href="https://aopo.org/wp-content/uploads/AOPO-SFC-Pancreas-Research-Statement-03-21-2023.pdf">reply to the committee</a>, AOPO protested that “OPOs have been operating according to the rule” and that the research donations mean “the organ does not go to waste.” Have they not gone to waste? The committee asked OPOs to report back which specific research studies they gave the pancreata to; I know of no OPO that has put out data formally tying each pancreas to a specific study.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This past January, <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-24-04-opo.pdf">CMS sent a letter to OPOs</a> reminding them that they could only count pancreases that were actually used for research. But it should go a step further and do what the <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/chairmans-news/wyden-grassley-cardin-and-young-call-on-cms-to-strengthen-protections-against-excessive-and-unnecessary-recoveries-of-pancreata-from-organ-donors">Senate committee is urging</a>: clarify that only pancreata donated to research approved by the FDA counts under the rule. That is, OPOs cannot make themselves look better and avoid decertification just by recovering pancreata and then sticking them in a freezer. They have to actually get the pancreata into the hands of scientists.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a very simple change, but it could mean the difference between rules that lead to thousands more organs going to people who need them, and rules that let the current system of unaccountable OPOs continue unabated.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Members of the media <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2024/08/18/harris-shouldnt-duck-the-press-vp-cant-avoid-news-conferences-and-interviews/">agree</a>: Vice President Kamala Harris <a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/kamala_harris_media_interviews_press_conferences.php">needs</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/13/kamala-harris-must-speak-to-press">start</a> doing <a href="https://www.poynter.org/commentary/2024/kamala-harris-no-interviews-journalists-reporters/">press</a> conferences and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/fault-lines/how-generic-can-kamala-harris-be">interviews</a> with members of the media.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s been about a month since Harris suddenly became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. In that period, Harris has at times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/business/media/kamala-harris-press-interviews.html">briefly answered questions</a> from reporters publicly — and has <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2024/08/07/why-harris-isnt-taking-questions-00173115">reportedly spoken</a> to her traveling press pool off the record. But she’s done no formal interviews and held no formal press conferences.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In fairness, she’s been quite busy. Over just a few scant weeks, Harris has had to take over a campaign, hit the trail, pick a running mate, develop a policy platform and message, and oversee preparations for a convention.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On August 8, Harris <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/08/business/media/kamala-harris-press-interviews.html">said</a> she wanted “to get an interview scheduled before the end of the month.” With so much in flux, it’s perhaps not surprising that high-stakes reporter Q&amp;As aren’t at the top of the priority list.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But should they be?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If you zoom out from the electoral stakes, of course it’s bad for democracy if politicians avoid talking to the press. Of course we should, in the abstract, expect the next potential future president to publicly answer questions about their proposals and other topics in the news.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Plus, with Harris’s campaign starting so unusually late, the public deserves to learn more about her. If she’s seen mainly in the tightly controlled and scripted settings of ads, rally speeches, and social media clips, we may not learn much about her views on issues and topics she prefers not to address, or assess how she responds to unplanned events.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But while it’s tempting to say (and convenient for journalists to argue) that Harris doing more press is both the right thing to do and the strategically smart thing for her to do, things may not align so neatly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Interviews and press conferences are risky for any politician. There is no guarantee they will go well, and for Harris in particular, some in recent years <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markjoyella/2021/06/08/kamala-harris-tells-nbcs-lester-holt-weve-been-to-the-border-he-responds-you-havent/">have gone infamously poorly</a>. As a candidate trying to win an election (against an opponent who is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24159069/trump-guardrails-authoritarian-democracy-second-term">hostile to democracy</a> and uses his own press appearances <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/15/politics/fact-check-trump-bedminster-news-conference/index.html">to lie and exaggerate wildly</a>), she will naturally weigh the risks and rewards of what might help, or harm, her campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what’s arguably the right thing to do for the health of our democracy — facing down some difficult media questions — really may not be the best strategy to help Harris win. However, remaining unavailable indefinitely poses its own strategic risks, and is likely unsustainable over the longer term.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Interviews gone awry have haunted Harris in the past</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since Harris joined the race, she has jumped <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model">out to a small lead</a> in polls and has benefited from overwhelmingly positive media coverage. The Democratic base has rallied around her and swing voters so far seem to like what they see. And all that has happened without a single formal press conference or interview.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">With things trending so positively, interviews and press conferences appear to present mainly downside risk. That is: the campaign probably calculates that it’s unlikely many undecided voters will be persuaded by anything she says in such formats (as opposed to messaging Harris can more fully control, like rallies and ads), while a botched answer could generate a great deal of new negative coverage and attacks.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has suffered such fates in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In January 2019, at the start of her presidential campaign, anchor Jake Tapper <a href="https://x.com/ShaneGoldmacher/status/1090090364420136960">asked at a CNN town hall</a> whether her support of Medicare-for-all meant she wanted to eliminate private health insurance. Harris responded by saying that, yes, you won’t have to go through a private insurance company anymore: “​​Let’s eliminate all that. Let’s move on.” That answer, and the topic of health care generally, would dog her in the months to come (she <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/28/kamala-harris-reverses-answer-abolishing-private-health-insurance-saying-she-misheard-question/">would eventually backtrack</a> on her answer).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Accounts of Harris’s vice presidency typically treat a <a href="https://x.com/TODAYshow/status/1402224936136187907">June 2021 interview</a> with Lester Holt of NBC News as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/11/us/politics/kamala-harris-vice-president.html">the moment</a> that put her off interviews in general. Tasked by President Joe Biden with addressing root causes of unauthorized immigration, Harris came prepared to discuss that policy matter and her <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/politics/kamala-harris-foreign-trip/index.html">recent trip</a> to Guatemala and Mexico. But Holt pressed her on a different question: why hadn’t she gone to the border herself yet?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question was of questionable relevance — how much can a president or vice president really learn from a brief border drop-by? And Harris <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">had been tasked</a> with addressing “root causes” and migration-related diplomacy with the Mexican and Guatemalan governments, not border security logistics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Harris answered strangely. Rather than simply batting it away by giving a vague answer that she planned to visit the border later on, she said she’d go at some point but then <a href="https://x.com/TODAYshow/status/1402224936136187907?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1402224936136187907%7Ctwgr%5E5523f213c4be80c2e5c7170e8599b0319d4d92c1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.npr.org%2F2021%2F06%2F08%2F1004504140%2Fharris-tries-to-turn-the-focus-to-migration-but-gets-bogged-down-in-border-quest">asserted</a> “We’ve been to the border,” repeating that sentence four times. Holt naturally followed up by saying that she hadn’t, in fact, been to the border. Harris responded: “And I haven’t been to Europe,” and laughed, before saying she didn’t understand Holt’s point.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris seemed to be trying to say that you don’t always have to physically go somewhere to learn a lot about a policy issue, and that she had only been in office for a few months and couldn’t have traveled everywhere yet. Regardless of what she meant, that exchange instantly became the only thing anyone focused on about that interview, and it earned Harris much mockery and criticism. Unsurprisingly, she did far fewer interviews like that afterward.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Accounts of Harris’s thinking suggest she intensely prepares for such interviews, that she’s highly concerned things may go wrong, and that she believes racism and sexism give her less leeway to make a mistake. “She felt as if she would be unfairly punished by the press corps if she ever faltered — and that her slipups might make it difficult for every Black woman who followed in her path,” Franklin Foer wrote in his book about the Biden administration, <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/534055/the-last-politician-by-franklin-foer/"><em>The Last Politician</em></a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Harris may feel she has to give interviews to avoid negative coverage for not giving interviews</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politicians in certain situations have good reasons to talk to the press. Some seek to increase their prominence and name recognition. Some are hoping to turn around their numbers because they are losing. Some want to promote their ideas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of these currently apply to Harris, who has gotten a ton of coverage since unexpectedly becoming the new Democratic nominee, who is currently leading in polls and who is still honing her ideas for a campaign and governing agenda.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there is actually a strategic case that doing more press could have its benefits for Harris — or at least, that it could avert possible future pitfalls.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, if a candidate does not have ample practice doing press in unscripted settings, he or she may get rusty and perform worse when such settings are unavoidable. (This may have been one factor explaining Biden’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/358652/biden-drop-out-debate-harris-convention">candidacy-destroying performance</a> at the June debate.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Additionally, if Harris keeps avoiding interviews, grumbling from the press will likely increase, and the narrative that she’s too afraid or incompetent to do interviews could catch on, generating negative coverage of a kind she’s mostly avoided so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, the post-convention period is arguably the optimal time for Harris to do press, since as Election Day draws nearer, the media typically frames coverage far more as a binary choice for the voters between the two nominees. That’s a frame Harris likely prefers, as she can focus on prosecuting the case against Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, expect Harris to do more press soon after the convention ends. But probably not too much more — unless she sees something in it for her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During his 2024 Democratic National Convention address on Tuesday night, former President Barack Obama made no secret of his disdain for Donald Trump. But his speech was more than just a partisan broadside: It was a philosophical brief in defense of liberalism, a kind of first-principles moral argument that no other major convention speaker offered.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Liberal, in this context, does not refer to the term’s use in partisan American politics. It refers instead to the centuries-old philosophical tradition that sees politics as fundamentally oriented around the values of freedom and equality. Government, for liberals, exists to enable people to live according to their own vision for their lives; it has no business telling people what god to worship or giving certain groups of people more rights than others.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Obama was a <a href="https://www.google.ca/books/edition/A_Thousand_Small_Sanities/6N1sDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=gopnik+liberalism&amp;printsec=frontcover">thoroughly liberal president</a>,&nbsp;and Trump a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/9/20750160/liberalism-trump-putin-socialism-reactionary">thoroughly illiberal one</a>. This clearly troubled Obama — troubled him so much, in fact, that he dedicated this most high-profile speech to explaining why Trump must be defeated not just politically but also philosophically.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The stakes of 2024, according to Barack Obama</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Obama is hardly the first person to declare Trump a mortal enemy of liberalism. Ever since 2016, there’s been a library’s worth of books published on liberalism’s Trump-induced crisis and how it ought to be resolved.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of Obama’s remarks followed this literature rather closely. Like many, Obama sees Trump’s divisive political style as opposed to liberalism’s core principle of equality: that all citizens deserve to be treated equally, each free to pursue a good life in the way they see fit (as long as they don’t hurt others in doing so).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump, Obama says, draws an elemental distinction “between the real Americans, who of course support [Trump], and the outsiders who don’t.” And that Trump and his allies believe “one group’s gain is another group’s loss,” and that “freedom means the powerful can do pretty much whatever they please.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This, Obama says, is wrong. It’s wrong not just for Democrats and progressives, but for Americans — citizens of a country whose <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691176604/the-expanding-blaze?srsltid=AfmBOoo3VtHFH5avX3a7GKBKl_8qJXDIPWg6RkSFl0u3EQL5bxCBUGx5">very existence grew out of liberal thought</a>. The Harris campaign, in his telling, is tapping into a fundamental liberal impulse that permeates the American body politic.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The vast majority of us do not want to live in a country that’s bitter and divided,” Obama said. “We want something that’s better. We want to be better. And the joy and excitement surrounding this campaign tells us that we’re not alone.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Living this liberal vision, for Obama, means accepting the diversity inherent to a large society made up of people with all sorts of beliefs and worldviews: recognizing that “our fellow citizens deserve the same grace we hope they’ll extend to us.” It means understanding “true freedom” as something that gives all of us the right “to make decisions about our own life [and] requires us to recognize that other people have the right to make decisions that are different than ours.” And it means seeing democracy as more than “just a bunch of abstract principles and a bunch of dusty laws in a book somewhere,” but rather “the values we live by.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This, to be clear, is not a case that Trump is un-American and thus will definitely lose: Obama took great pains to emphasize that the race was still close and could go either way. Rather, Obama is saying that what Trump stands for contradicts many of the values that Americans claim to hold dear — our core sense of what our country is about and what it stands for. That America’s truest identity is liberal, and that this identity can transcend those things that divide us.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I want to agree with that. But as I <a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/zack-beauchamp/the-reactionary-spirit/9781541704411/">argue in my recent book</a>, there is a deeply illiberal strain in American politics — an ideology born out of the essential contradiction between America’s stated liberal ideals and the reality of chattel slavery at its founding.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This tradition, like Trump, rejects core liberal-democratic ideals about equality. It is no more and no less American than our loftier stated ideals; both represent authentic aspects of America’s identity, and both have triumphed at different times throughout our country’s history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question, then, is not whether American liberalism can reassert its naturally dominant place. It is whether the America that Obama believes in will triumph in this round of a centuries-old struggle against an authoritarian twin.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Something wonderfully magical is in the air, isn’t it?” former first lady Michelle Obama <a href="https://x.com/brianstelter/status/1826088090600919123">said</a> in her speech at the Democratic National Convention Tuesday. “A familiar feeling that’s been buried too deep for too long.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“You know what I’m talking about? It’s the contagious power of hope!” she said, adding: “America, hope is making a comeback.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rhetoric harkened back to Barack Obama’s first presidential campaign in 2008 — when Democrats ran on hope and change. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But when you think about it, it’s kind of brutal toward Kamala Harris’s predecessor as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Michelle Obama was quite clearly implying that the party, and perhaps the country, had lost hope under Joe Biden, and that it took Harris to bring that hope back. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Few Democrats have gone so far as to openly admit how bad the vibes had gotten. Even before Biden’s disastrous debate with Donald Trump in June, his polling had been quite poor for nearly a year. More and more people in the party began to view defeat as highly likely, if not inevitable. Since then, hope has indeed returned, but in this new era of good feelings, few Democrats have publicly dwelled on how bleak things had been.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The speech crystallized something fascinating about how the presidential contest has changed in the past month — namely, that Harris seems to have become the “change” candidate who can channel hopes for the future, even though her administration currently runs Washington and she is the incumbent vice president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In part, that’s because Harris is younger — not being an octogenarian or even a septuagenarian — and because her election would be a demographic first. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But it’s also because her opponent Donald Trump has already served as president, and has incessantly dominated the nation’s politics and much of its mental mindshare for the past decade. Not only is Trump obsessed with relitigating controversies and grudges from his first term, but he also has too much of a political history at this point to credibly promise he could lead the country in a truly new direction.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When the public is dissatisfied, a newer, lesser-known change candidate can have a real advantage. Without having been in power, such a candidate can be all things to all people; they can represent the public’s hopes, having not yet disappointed them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Barack Obama thought this was crucial in his rise to political prominence, “I serve as a blank screen,” he wrote in his 2006 book <em>The Audacity of Hope</em>, “on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has benefited from a similar dynamic. She has given Democrats, and voters generally, who were disappointed or disillusioned under Biden a reason to hope she will be different in a way that they like. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That was on display Tuesday, when both Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and former American Express CEO Ken Chenault spoke effusively about Harris not too far removed from each other. It’s also been evident in how protests of Biden’s Israel policies have been far less of a factor at the convention than many expected. And it’s front and center in the campaign’s rhetoric that Harris wants to go forward, not back.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The risk of being the change candidate is that you are less experienced, but being the incumbent veep helps Harris with that. Currently, she appears to be getting the benefits of experience from serving under Biden without the downsides of being held accountable for his record.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump team now very much wants to recouple Harris and Biden — blaming her for the inflation, foreign crises, and border chaos that have occurred in the past four years. In the face of these attacks, Harris’s task is to ensure voters keep viewing her as the new and hopeful future, rather than the past. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might have seen previews or even bought tickets for the new film adaptation of Colleen Hoover’s bestselling romance novel <em>It Ends With Us</em>, starring Blake Lively. But have you heard about the online soap opera surrounding a rumored rift among the film’s cast, its director and co-star Justin Baldoni, and possibly Deadpool?&nbsp;Once again, a film’s press tour is stirring up more conversation than the movie itself.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The week leading up to the <em>It Ends With Us</em> premiere is already bringing back memories of the weeks-long, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/chris-pine-harry-styles-spit-gate-dont-worry-darling-memes-1235338698/">spit-covered</a> scandal surrounding <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2022/9/6/23339631/dont-worry-darling-wilde-pugh-feud-explained"><em>Don’t Worry Darling</em></a> in 2022. In fact, it seems like the excitement of that previous drama has incited social media users to pull out their Sherlock caps and magnifying glasses. So far, any concrete details about this supposed on-set drama are sparse.<strong> </strong>The only person involved in the film to comment on the gossip and subsequent backlash against Lively on social media is Brendan Sklenar, who plays one of Lively’s love interests. On August 20, he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-5nF_IJr73/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">issued</a> a lengthy but vague statement on Instagram condemning the “negativity being projected online.” Notably, he also alluded to “what may or may not have happened behind the scenes,” leaving the door open for more speculation.<strong> </strong>If <em>It Ends With Us</em>’s<em> </em><a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/it-ends-with-us-box-office-blake-lively-justin-baldoni-1236044788/">box-office numbers</a> are<em> </em>any indication — the film made $100 million domestically in less than two weeks — the gossip has certainly benefited the film. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It all started with <em>It Ends With Us</em>’s New York premiere on August 6, when fans noticed that Lively and Baldoni hadn’t been photographed on the red carpet together, nor have they been paired for interviews. Initially all signs of trouble pointed to Baldoni, but the narrative began to shift when a <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1405851/blake-lively-reveals-ryan-reynolds-wrote-iconic-it-ends-with-us-scene">quote</a> from Lively about her husband Ryan Reynolds’s involvement in the film’s script went viral. And on Friday, insiders <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/blake-lively-justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-drama-what-we-know-1235969708/">confirmed</a> to the Hollywood Reporter that there was a power struggle between the two parties when it came to the film’s final cut. At the same time, remarks from Baldoni <a href="https://x.com/people/status/1821568076267085985">praising Lively</a>, while also hinting at a creative overhaul, are coming out. Most recently, Baldoni <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/it-ends-with-us-justin-baldoni-melissa-nathan-blake-lively-1236039853/">hired</a> crisis publicist Melissa Nathan, who represented Johnny Depp during his <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/23043519/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-fairfax-county-domestic-abuse-violence-me-too">highly publicized defamation trial</a> in 2022. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite any PR manager’s recent attempts to smooth out drama, the internet has already made up its mind. It’s maybe not surprising that this has turned into yet another game of optics and who has the most goodwill online. It speaks to the quick, sometimes dangerous escalation of gossip in the post-Deuxmoi world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is Justin Baldoni and does his cast hate him?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before we get into whether the<em> It Ends With Us</em> cast hates Baldoni, some information about the actor-turned-director. You might recognize Baldoni from the hit CW <em>Jane the Virgin</em> where he played Rafael, the hunky father of Jane’s child. In 2019, he co-founded the production company Wayfarer Studios with billionaire entrepreneur Steve Sarowitz. Baldoni has directed and produced a few movies under his Wayfarer banner, including the teen cancer romance <em>Five Feet Apart</em> in 2019 and the 2020 Disney+ musical drama <em>Clouds</em>. In 2022, it was reported that Sarowitz <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/wayfarer-studios-125-million-investment-justin-baldoni-steve-sarowitz-1235295142/">invested $125 million</a> into the independent production company.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even with all this power, you might still be wondering why this fairly new director was selected to helm such a massive IP about a woman’s experience with domestic abuse.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The answer seems to partially lie in his extracurricular work. As a vocal feminist ally, discussing women’s issues — or more accurately, men’s issues — has been a huge, if not defining, part of Baldoni’s brand. In 2017, the actor launched a panel series called <em>Man Enough</em> through Wayfarer, featuring actors Matt McGorry and Javier Munoz, exploring, in his words, “what it means to be a man.” In 2021, he published a memoir titled <a href="https://manenough.com/podcast/"><em>Man Enough? Undefining My Masculinity</em></a> about his journey overcoming the expectations of traditional manhood. He later launched a podcast of the same name with co-hosts Jamey Heath and former Vox political correspondent Liz Plank. Like McGorry, he’s one of several self-identifying male feminists who emerged during the Trump era and gained both praise for their activism and criticism for a <a href="https://pittnews.com/article/130284/opinions/editorial-justin-baldonis-feminism-male-focused/">male-centered</a>, “<a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/iexplorer/woke-bae-day">mansplain-y</a>” approach to that activism.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-800668332.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.3509154173848,100,81.29816916523" alt="Actor Justin Baldoni speaks into a microphone, wearing a gray suit and white shirt, in front of a red-curtain backdrop." title="Actor Justin Baldoni speaks into a microphone, wearing a gray suit and white shirt, in front of a red-curtain backdrop." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Actor Justin Baldoni speaks onstage at the 2017 NALIP Latino Media Awards. | Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for NALIP" data-portal-copyright="Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for NALIP" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, it seems appropriate that Baldoni would go after Hoover’s novel about domestic abuse. After he sent Hoover a <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/it-ends-with-us-author-colleen-hoover-says-justin-baldoni-struggled-a-little-bit-with-idea-of-playing-ryle-184652889.html">letter</a> about his love for the book, his production company <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/justin-baldoni-it-ends-with-us-movie-jane-the-virgin-1203268293/">optioned the project</a> in 2019. Blake Lively was brought on as an executive producer in 2017, and from there, the project seemed to descend into chaos.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Throughout the press tour, Baldoni has been noticeably isolated not just from Lively but the entire main cast, <a href="https://deadline.com/gallery/it-ends-with-us-premiere-red-carpet-photos/it-ends-with-us-new-york-premiere-arrivals/">posing by himself</a> on the red carpet (or with other people not involved in the film) and <a href="https://youtu.be/nc-wVlkAGGA?feature=shared">giving</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/niSOhLp-jdE?feature=shared">solo</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/dpD9OEzZFZc?feature=shared">interviews</a>. His co-host Plank was also at the premiere but was not photographed with Baldoni. Baldoni and Plank did not immediately respond to Vox’s requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Lively has been doing press with her co-stars Jenny Slate and Brandon Sklenar and author Colleen Hoover. When Lively and Sklenar appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DrE3Ih46Y0"><em>CBS Mornings</em></a> to promote the film, as well as other media outlets, there was no mention of the director. A <a href="https://x.com/camis_unicorn/status/1821272044866039992">video of Slate</a> at the premiere sparked further speculation, when she gave an indirect response to a reporter’s question about working with Baldoni as a boss and screen partner. Lively and Slate did not immediately respond to Vox’s requests for comment.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The cast’s Instagram activity doesn’t look great for Baldoni either. Based on quick searches, it looks like none of the main cast — aside from comedian Hasan Minhaj, who has a supporting role — are following him on the platform. Slate also made a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-V5m85yUhl/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">post</a> on Instagram earlier this week, shouting out Lively with no acknowledgement of Baldoni. The director is also absent from Sklenar’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C93CsR8yDi6/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2">recent</a><em> It Ends With Us</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C8aMoXDyT4x/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2">posts</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>How is Deadpool involved in this?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Reynolds’s supposed involvement in this scandal went from confusion to outrage. A claim from Lively that her husband wrote the movie’s “iconic rooftop scene” at the premiere began to circulate. “He works on everything I do,&#8221; Lively told <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1405851/blake-lively-reveals-ryan-reynolds-wrote-iconic-it-ends-with-us-scene">E! News</a>. “I work on everything he does. So his wins, his celebrations are mine, and mine are his. He’s all over this film.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">People began to theorize that Lively and Reynolds seized creative control of the film from Baldoni, which led to the rift — although, that wouldn’t exactly explain why the rest of the cast has seemingly distanced themselves from him. At the premiere, Baldoni also made a telling comment about Lively. When asked about directing <em>It Ends With Us</em>’s inevitable sequel, he <a href="https://people.com/justin-baldoni-blake-lively-direct-it-ends-with-us-sequel-8693095">said</a>, “I think that there are better people for that one. I think Blake Lively’s ready to direct, that’s what I think.”</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-2165630299.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Actors Hugh Jackman, Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds, from left to right, stand in front of a promotional backdrop." title="Actors Hugh Jackman, Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds, from left to right, stand in front of a promotional backdrop." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Actors Hugh Jackman, Blake Lively, and Ryan Reynolds attend the&lt;em&gt; It Ends With Us&lt;/em&gt; New York premiere on August 6, 2024. " data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Lively’s comments about Reynolds set off a wave of <a href="https://x.com/valyonce/status/1821731891537703305">accusations</a> that Reynolds was <a href="https://x.com/stonelovebot/status/1821670994748026882">too</a> <a href="https://x.com/choneybuttr/status/1821635870493163742">involved</a> in Lively’s career. It also sparked discourse on whether the pair were appropriately promoting a film about domestic violence.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Based on their combined marketing efforts, it seems that Lively and Reynolds were looking to create their own “Barbenheimer” with the closely timed releases of <em>Deadpool vs. Wolverine</em> and <em>It Ends With Us</em> this summer. Leading up to the premiere, Blake Lively and her husband’s co-star Hugh Jackman covered <em>Vogue</em>. Jackman also made a cameo at the <em>It Ends With Us</em> premiere, while Reynolds filmed a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-VeN9WJhmG/?hl=en">skit</a> where he pretended to interview Sklenar for the film. Lively also released her new hair care line, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/shopping/blake-lively-haircare-brand-blake-brown-beauty-launch-date-pricing-collection-1235963366/">Blake Brown</a>, during the movie’s press run, a move some <a href="https://x.com/gnuyear/status/1821706923596525866">online</a> <a href="https://x.com/SailorSammy93/status/1821521540606828950">critics</a> found insensitive given the film’s subject matter.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Don’t Worry Darling</em></strong><strong> is written all over this scandal&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s fair to say that the <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em> kerfuffle both destroyed our brains and heightened our thirst for this kind of behind-the-scenes drama. It’s hardly the first time that the rumors of hostility between co-stars have made headlines, especially on <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellendurney/jamie-dornan-dakota-johnson-friendship-update-fifty-shades">high-profile romantic films</a>, although, typically, they do not cause this much of a hullabaloo. The specific players involved in the <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em> fiasco — namely, director Olivia Wilde, her ex-fiancé Jason Sudeikis, and her co-star Harry Styles — seemed to color everyone’s assessments of who was guilty and who was innocent, to the point where the internet was supporting <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/shia-labeouf-denies-fired-olivia-wilde-dont-worry-darling-1235350529/">claims</a> about Wilde made by alleged abuser <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/arts/music/fka-twigs-shia-labeouf-abuse.html">Shia LaBeouf</a>. Social media’s perceptions of the people and relationships involved seemed to matter more than whatever actually occurred on-set.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You could argue that is happening with the suspicion toward Lively and Reynolds, but for perhaps more legitimate reasons than Wilde dumping Ted Lasso. Despite their power in Hollywood, Lively and Reynolds don’t have a ton of goodwill on social media — mainly for their controversial plantation wedding in 2012 that they eventually <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1185191/a-look-at-blake-lively-and-ryan-reynolds-deeply-controversial-wedding">apologized for in 2020</a>. (There was also that <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/10/13/6969341/blake-lively-preserve-slavery-antebellum">weird write-up</a> celebrating antebellum fashion on Lively’s now-defunct lifestyle website Preserve.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, the internet — although, certainly not <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/deadpool-wolverine-global-box-office-milestone-mcu-top-10-1236033748/">moviegoers</a> — has seemingly had enough of Reynolds’s snarky take on Deadpool. There’s also the couple’s highly documented friendship with <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/taylor-swifts-friendship-with-blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-pics/">Taylor Swift</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whether we’ll actually get to the bottom of Baldoni and Lively’s alleged issues, the internet has already taken sides. As with <em>Don’t Worry Darling</em>, we’ll probably end up discovering that there are no winners in this whole mess.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/362300/kamala-harris-meme-brat-summer">Charli xcx memes</a> to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mxwlch03/video/7394583648571313424?q=kamala%20charli%20xcx&amp;t=1724087690722">fan-made</a> covers interpolating her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mindyrose7/video/7394876881708780842?q=america%20has%20a%20problem%20kamala&amp;t=1724087650306">famous “coconut tree” quote</a>, Kamala Harris’s last-minute presidential bid against Republican candidate Donald Trump has had a fascinating and outsized relationship with pop music. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Various progressive singers, like <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/kamala-harris-president-katy-perry-ariana-grande-jamie-lee-curtis-b2583697.html">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/olivia-rodrigo-kamala-harris-reproductive-rights-1236082554/">Olivia Rodrigo</a>, have pledged their support. Katy Perry <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/katy-perry-hopes-kamalas-run-for-president-can-save-womans-world">offered</a> one of her latest singles, “Woman’s World,” for the current vice president to use in her campaign, though Harris doesn’t seem to have taken her up on it. Meanwhile, Harris’s staff has found ways to use pop music to attract Gen Z voters, having <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/megan-thee-stallion-performs-mamushi-body-kamala-harris-atlanta-rally-1235743523/">Megan Thee Stallion</a> perform at an Atlanta rally and fully embracing brat memes. This onslaught of memes and coconut-themed “remixes” has almost overshadowed the most crucial music-related decision involved in Harris’s candidacy: her campaign song. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last month, it was <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/beyonce-kamala-harris-campaign-freedom-rcna163599">reported</a> that Beyoncé permitted the Harris (now Harris-Walz) campaign to use her song “Freedom” featuring Kendrick Lamar. Since then, the rousing gospel-tinged anthem from her 2016 album<em> Lemonade</em> has soundtracked Harris’s rally entrances and will inevitably be heard several times at this week’s Democratic National Convention. There’s even speculation that Beyoncé herself could make an appearance. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The modern campaign song has become its own character — and target of inspection — in election politics. Most of these songs have already achieved popularity outside of the campaign trail, so they need to be vital enough to re-energize constituents. They also have to be memorable and on message, embodying the values and promises of the candidate. But are they actually useful? What does it mean for a song to belong to a campaign?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Post-Trump, pop music is also something that Democrats have been able to leverage against the right — not just big hits themselves but endorsements from the artists who make them. Conversely, there’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicians_who_oppose_Donald_Trump%27s_use_of_their_music">Wikipedia page of musicians</a> who have opposed Trump’s use of their music on the campaign trail, in addition to opposing him as president. However, the results of the 2016 presidential election have made the public <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/election-celebrities-trump-clinton-endorsements-beyonce-springsteen-david-jackson-bowling-green/507383/">second-guess</a> the power of pop music in this sphere. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite this skepticism, Dana Gorzelany-Mostak, an associate professor of music at Georgia College, argues that music can be an effective medium for politicians. “While it might not drive people to the polls, music models ways of being in the world and connecting with others,” she says. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-621629084.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.63457185461,100,76.730856290779" alt="Beyoncé onstage in a black suit with white polka dots, blonde hair flying." title="Beyoncé onstage in a black suit with white polka dots, blonde hair flying." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Beyoncé performing at a Get Out The Vote concert for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on November 4, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For a campaign like Harris’s that has mostly trafficked in <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366368/tim-walz-vibes-memes-vice-president">“good vibes”</a> and likability over discussions about policy — the vice president just unveiled her policy agenda — Harris’s campaign playlist provides an interesting window into what she represents and which populations she’s counting on for support. As Jonquilyn Hill wrote for Vox, Harris’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/367288/kamala-harris-beyonce-press-silence-campaign">proximity to Beyoncé</a> may even signal how she plans to conduct herself. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I spoke to Gorzelany-Mostak to get more insight into Harris’s musical selections and the overall function of campaign songs. Her book, <em><a href="https://press.umich.edu/Books/T/Tracks-on-the-Trail">Tracks on the Trail: Popular Music, Race, and the US Presidency</a></em>, published last year, charts notable campaign songs and how these musical moments are used to articulate race. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>When did presidential campaign songs really become a thing?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The election of 1840 was a watershed moment for the campaign song. The supporters of Whig candidate William Henry Harrison promoted singing as a campaign-worthy activity, and they published small booklets called “songsters” with pro-Harrison lyrics. These candidate-inspired lyrics were set to the popular tunes of the day. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What goes into picking a campaign song? Is the candidate even directly involved in this process?&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It varies depending on the campaign. In 2008, Barack Obama’s staffers had the candidate’s music tastes in mind when selecting his playlist. There was continuity between the artists he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/25/barackobama.uselections2008">discussed in interviews</a> on the trail and his rally playlist, which included Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Stevie Wonder, and the Isley Brothers. Donald Trump is known to select his own soundtrack for campaign rallies, and when off the clock, he “spins” from his iPad at Mar-a-Lago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What is the function of a campaign song, and why do campaign songs matter?  </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Candidates use music to constitute their identity in sound, to sonically construct themselves in a way that appeals to the public as well as offers insight into their character and their beliefs. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A campaign song is more than its lyrics. Candidates need to think about the myriad ways songs might signal messages in political contexts. This means taking into consideration the artist’s biography, the composition and character of the artist’s fan communities, the connotations attached to the song’s genre, and of course, the meanings a song has accrued through its presence in other media. While pundits may privilege the spoken word or images, sound and music can be just as powerful persuaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, campaign music preaches to the choir. I don’t think it converts people or drives them away.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In </strong><strong><em>Tracks on the Trail</em></strong><strong>, you write about candidates articulating race through music. What do you think Kamala Harris is trying to convey by choosing songs, both formerly and currently, by high-profile Black women? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Black female artists form the backbone of Harris’s 2024 rally playlist — Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Lizzo, Megan Thee Stallion. Harris elevates a matrilineal paradigm of Black excellence that spans 60 years. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a notable contrast to the classic-rock-dominated Republican National Convention last month, which featured a band of aging male rockers playing covers of the Eagles, Kenny Loggins, Grand Funk Railroad, Steely Dan, and the Doobie Brothers. Trump has questioned Harris’s leadership cred and her racial identity, so Harris uses her soundtrack to disrupt this narrative by leaning into the very identity that he critiques.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Harris’s previous campaign song, Mary J.Blige’s “Work That,” is a lot more light-hearted and fun, in tone and message, compared to Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” which is a more austere, urgent song. How do you think these songs reflect the differences in those campaigns or even the broader political climate? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Freedom” does convey a certain level of urgency. But more broadly, Harris’s playlist reminds voters that they can acknowledge the country’s painful history, commit to the serious work that needs to be done, but still sing, laugh, and dance along with her on the path to victory. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of Harris’s playlist is composed of dance music, from Diana Ross and The Brothers Johnson to Dua Lipa and Bruno Mars, not to mention the more recent sounds of Charli xcx. To folks on the right, disco might signal the dangers of hedonism. But a genre that finds its roots in the leisure culture of Latinx, Black, and gay communities, it also points to a rich history of resistance and hope — even though these sounds have long since been domesticated, as evidenced by their presence on your mother’s gym playlist. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is not surprising that some of the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mxwlch03/video/7394583648571313424?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">videos</a> of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xcx.archive/video/7394640702946250014?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">Harris</a> set to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jqsids/video/7394543209814248737?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">Charli xcx</a>’s music show the candidate laughing, dancing, or mid-gaffe — Trump himself has even <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2024/08/18/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-presidential-election-latest-news/">criticized Harris’s laughter</a>. By infusing her playlist with unfettered expressions of joy and pleasure that are Black, queer, and/or female-centered, Harris manages to wrest the reins away from the male-centric gerontocracy, if only on the dance floor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I find there’s a dissonance between the breezy, light-hearted tone of Harris’s campaign and the way it has been memed by Gen Z with the austerity of a song like “Freedom” — not to mention, “Freedom” is hardly one of Beyoncé’s most popular songs. Do you think this choice is a misstep? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite its more austere tone, I do think “Freedom” is a good fit for Harris. It brings together a lot of narratives that align with her campaign message and the presidential brand she is trying to cultivate. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Freedom” adopts an almost prayerful tone in its adoption of gospel signifiers and its textual reference to the spiritual “Wade in the Water.” In the spiritual, water represents the possibility for escape in times of enslavement. In “Freedom,” water also comes in the form of “rain” and “tears.” This alludes to the aftermath of Beyoncé’s personal turmoil and the cultural trauma of New Orleans post-hurricane and of Black communities impacted by mass incarceration. The song also samples the voices of a mid-century prisoner and preacher, and Jay Z’s grandmother opening up about her own hardship in 2015. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In choosing “Freedom,” Harris is situating herself and the 2024 election in the lineage and the sound world of these transhistorical struggles, both personal and political.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It seems like Beyoncé&#8217;s co-sign is maybe more powerful than the song itself. </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyoncé herself is a symbol of feminine power, endurance, and vitality. Her music defies categorization. She writes her own rules and regularly reinvents herself. So it’s no surprise that Harris wants to align herself with such a narrative as she embarks on her own reinvention from prosecutor to district attorney, to attorney general, to senator, to vice president, to president of the United States. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The rape and killing of a 31-year-old woman medical resident has touched off protests across India as the country grapples with inadequate protections for women and increasing <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-what-to-know-80596fc7aa0880133f56ace5d77240b2">reports of gender-based violence</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The demonstrations began in Kolkata — the capital of the eastern Indian state of West Bengal — following the woman’s rape and killing, which took place on August 9 at a medical school. They’ve since spread to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-medics-refuse-end-protests-over-doctors-rape-murder-2024-08-19/">other states, as well as the country’s capital, New Delhi</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The death of the trainee is just the latest of several <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/7/india-supreme-court-to-monitor-investigations-into-manipur-sexual-violence?traffic_source=KeepReading">high-profile recent incidents of gender-based violence</a> in India, and it comes at a time when sexual violence appears to be on the rise: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-what-to-know-80596fc7aa0880133f56ace5d77240b2">According to the National Crime Records Bureau</a>, there was a 20 percent increase in reported rapes in 2022 compared to 2021. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Indian government implemented stricter laws against sexual- and gender-based violence, as well as some <a href="https://pulitzercenter.org/stories/india-lacks-national-policy-strengthen-health-response-gender-based-violence">national strategies to address it</a>, following international outcry over the 2012 case of a young woman who was gang raped and killed on a bus. But as the current tragedy <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/7/india-supreme-court-to-monitor-investigations-into-manipur-sexual-violence?traffic_source=KeepReading">and other high-profile cases</a> suggest, those laws have not ended India’s systemic problems with gender-based violence, and now, many of the protesters say they’ve had enough.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As part of the protests, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indian-medics-refuse-end-protests-over-doctors-rape-murder-2024-08-19/">thousands of doctors</a> (by some estimates, <a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2024/08/13/india/kolkata-doctor-strike-trainee-rape-murder-intl-hnk">hundreds of thousands of doctors</a>) have left their posts. On Saturday, doctors across the country — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-what-to-know-80596fc7aa0880133f56ace5d77240b2">led primarily by women</a> — held a 24-hour strike. Over the past few days, some physicians,  such as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-d3f23d145891ec3031617647a8cc0166">a group of doctors in New Delhi,</a> have attempted to set up limited free care as part of their demonstrations, and most have refused to see non-emergency patients. Government officials have demanded that the protesting doctors return to work as usual; they have refused until their demands are met.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Political leaders have called for justice. In an address on August 15 — India’s independence day — Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, without mentioning the Kolkata rape and death, that everyone in the country must “seriously think about the kind of atrocities which are taking place against our mothers, sisters, daughters” and that “crime against women should be investigated more urgently.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As of now, the investigation into the rape and death continues, as do renewed calls for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-d3f23d145891ec3031617647a8cc0166">India to strengthen legal protections</a> for medical professionals generally and women specifically.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What we know about the death and rape of a student doctor in India&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are still a number of unknowns about the woman at the heart of the protests, who, per Indian law, has not been publicly named. However, we do know she worked at Kolkata’s government-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital. She reportedly fell asleep in a seminar room at the hospital, after a long shift as a trainee physician. The following morning, on August 9, her colleagues found her body.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">An autopsy report showed signs of sexual violence. A <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/kolkata-doctor-death-who-is-sanjay-roy-civic-volunteer-arrested-in-rg-kar-hospital-rape-murder-case/articleshow/112440685.cms">volunteer with the police</a>, identified as Sanjay Roy, has been arrested and charged with her murder. The woman’s parents <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/kolkata/kolkata-doctors-rape-murder-colleagues-involved-in-crime-parents-tell-cbi/article68532505.ece">insist that more people were involved</a>. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-d3f23d145891ec3031617647a8cc0166">Federal officials have taken</a> over the investigation of the case.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the inquiry continues, doctors are protesting for safer conditions at their hospitals, including a law that would remove bail for those accused of attacking doctors. They are also demanding a swift resolution to the case and have prompted an examination of larger systemic issues with Indian gender-based violence, including stigma around sexual assault in the country and mistrust of local police, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/india-doctor-rape-protests-what-to-know-80596fc7aa0880133f56ace5d77240b2">according to</a> the Associated Press.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Religious and ethnic minorities have been subject to gender-based and sexual violence by the state. Perhaps one of the most shocking historical cases is the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41268906">mass rape perpetrated by the Indian military in Kashmir in 1991</a>. More recently, in Jammu, a part of Kashmir that is a site of government repression and popular uprising, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43722714">an 8-year-old girl</a> was kidnapped, held in a Hindu temple, tortured, raped, and murdered by a former government officer and police co-conspirators in 2017. Police said the crime was part of an effort <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/six-men-convicted-in-rape-of-8-year-old-girl-that-shocked-india/2019/06/10/cde7b17c-8b5f-11e9-b162-8f6f41ec3c04_story.html">to push the nomadic Muslim community to which the girl belonged out of the area</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Infamously, Modi’s government <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/9/why-did-indias-supreme-court-send-bilkis-banos-rapists-back-to-jail">overturned the sentences of 11 men convicted of raping a Muslim woman in the 2002 Gujarat riots</a>, though they were eventually sent back to jail. Modi was at the time chief minister of Gujarat, and around 2,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed in the riots. And cases like the woman’s proliferate at the community level as well; in the wake of her case, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/uttar-pradesh/dalit-nurse-raped-by-doctor-in-up-hospital-3-held/article68542561.ece">three doctors were accused of raping a nurse</a> in northern India. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s so much gender-based violence” in India, Ather Zia, an anthropology professor at Northern Colorado University, told Vox. She added that’s by no means exclusive to India, though. “That’s the entire world.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since launching her presidential bid, Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign and its supporters have been eager to frame this election as one of a prosecutor versus a felon. It was among the themes of the first night of the Democratic National Convention on Monday. “In the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate yet equally important groups: the police who investigate crime and the district attorneys who prosecute the offenders. This is the story of Donald Trump,” a deep-voiced narrator said in a video that blared to the audience at the United Center in Chicago. “We need a president who has spent her life prosecuting perpetrators like Donald Trump.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The video was a play on what has become a part of Harris’s stump speech, in which she burnishes her legacy as a prosecutor. “I took on perpetrators of all kinds,” she told a crowd in Philadelphia on August 6. “Predators who abused women. Fraudsters who scammed consumers. Cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.” Others have made the contrast between the two candidates more explicit. “The script writes itself: the prosecutor against the convicted felon,” California Sen. Alex Padilla <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362619/kamala-harris-president-vision-political-ideology-2024-election" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/362619/kamala-harris-president-vision-political-ideology-2024-election">told Vox last month</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The framing aims to create a stark split screen between Harris and Trump, showing how they both fall squarely on opposite ends of the law. But it’s not clear that this line of attack is effective, and there are real downsides to propagating the simplistic story of good versus evil in the context of prosecutors and felons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s because it’s not always such a clear contrast. Prosecutors, for example, have a <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/why-holding-prosecutors-accountable-is-so-difficult/">history of bending the rules</a> to get a conviction, and thousands of people <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/magazine/magazine_article/a-matter-of-conviction/">have been sent to prisons</a> for crimes they did not commit. Which brings us to the term “felon,” a label that stigmatizes more than it describes —&nbsp;and does a real disservice to efforts to reform a broken justice system.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Let’s get something out of the way up front: Calling Trump a felon is not unfair to Trump personally. While there are millions of people who’ve been mistreated by the US justice system, Trump is not one of them. He has spent years, if not decades, skirting the law, yet he has still evaded any meaningful personal consequences for his misdeeds. Indeed, after the Supreme Court’s ruling in <em>Trump v. United States</em>, his status as above the law has the US judiciary’s seal of approval.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But for others —&nbsp;particularly those living on the margins of society —&nbsp;the label “felon” can be a mark of injustice. It reduces a full human, even one who’s rehabilitated, to one of their worst moments, and it further stigmatizes people with a felony conviction as inherently dangerous and undeserving of a second chance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Nearly 20 million American citizens have a felony conviction, and 1 in 3 people across our country have some sort of record. Labeling people as ‘felons’ or using the word as a badge of honor for political purposes is a slap in the face to the millions of impacted individuals and families,” Desmond Meade, president of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, <a href="https://time.com/7001914/prosecutor-versus-felon-narrative-trump-harris-essay/">wrote in a Time op-ed</a> last month. “The truth is the label doesn’t harm Trump, as much as it harms the millions of other people living with felony convictions.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>“Felon” doesn’t hurt Trump —&nbsp;but it can hurt millions of others</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When she ran for president in 2020, Harris tried to dub herself a “progressive prosecutor” — a <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/363859/kamala-harris-prosecutor-record-tough-crime">label that didn’t stick</a> because her record had some tough-on-crime bona fides that didn’t sit well with many progressive voters.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This time, however, Harris and her supporters don’t seem as shy about touting some of the tougher elements of her record as district attorney and attorney general. That’s why the “prosecutor versus felon” framing seems to be taking hold with little concern about how it might alienate some progressive voters or criminal justice reform advocates.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem with the way a lot of people use the word “felon” — as some of Harris’s supporters are doing — is that it’s often used not just as a neutral descriptor but as an insult. And it’s an insult that leans on society’s existing prejudices about who “felons” are.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Take this telling example from the Trump campaign. Despite representing a candidate convicted of 34 felonies, the campaign —&nbsp;in one of its opening attacks against Tim Walz — <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/184621/donald-trump-kamala-harris-tim-walz-felon-voting">criticized the Democratic vice presidential nominee</a> for “embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump campaign is comfortable attacking “felons” despite Trump’s felony convictions precisely because of the tropes associated with the word “felon.” The campaign clearly knows that for many people, especially its supporters, the word isn’t associated with people like Trump —&nbsp;no matter how <a href="https://trac.syr.edu/reports/708/">common white-collar crime is</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When most Americans think about who is in the criminal legal system, they envision somebody who is Black, who is poor, who is somebody who is ‘not like us,’” said Insha Rahman, director of Vera Action, a criminal justice reform advocacy group. “There’s an othering there that is inherent in calling somebody a ‘felon.’ It doesn’t stick to Donald Trump because he doesn’t fit those characteristics that are in people’s minds, but the danger is that it will stick to others and reinforce that stigma the more it’s thrown around.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American politicians have long weaponized the stigma around the term felon to bar millions of people from voting through the years, even after serving their sentences. And felony disenfranchisement laws, many of which cropped up during Reconstruction, were specifically <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/racism-felony-disenfranchisement-intertwined-history">designed to undermine Black voter blocs</a>. That’s why campaigns to uphold felony disenfranchisement laws often <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/opinion/the-racist-origins-of-felon-disenfranchisement.html">lean on racist tropes</a>, labeling people with felony convictions as inherently dangerous to society while disproportionately disenfranchising Black, brown, and poor people.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When an average person is labeled a “felon,” the word carries a lot more weight throughout their life than it does for Trump. Once people leave prison, reentering society has many barriers, and the stigma that comes along with being seen only through a felony conviction makes it difficult to reintegrate into society. From voting rights to housing to employment and educational opportunities, people with felony convictions <a href="https://civilrightsdocs.info/pdf/criminal-justice/Re-Entry-Fact-Sheet.pdf">face harsh discrimination</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the last decade or so, many organizations have been pushing people to stop using the word “felon” to describe individuals because of the way it reduces a person’s identity to a single category. Media outlets have also been discouraged from using the term. Bill Keller, the founding editor-in-chief of the Marshall Project, for example, <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2016/04/27/the-other-f-word">wrote in 2016</a> that “Words that not long ago were used without qualms may come to be regarded as demeaning: ‘colored,’ ‘illegals.’ ‘Felon,’ which makes the person synonymous with the crime, is such a word.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>So how should Harris talk about Trump’s crimes?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the obstacles to boiling the election down to “prosecutor versus felon” is that Harris’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/363859/kamala-harris-prosecutor-record-tough-crime">own record as a prosecutor</a> underscores exactly why those labels aren’t so black and white. And while some voters may relish watching a prosecutor at work, others in her coalition — specifically progressive voters —&nbsp;are only reminded of her tough-on-crime bona fides that they’re not fans of. That’s particularly true of cases where she <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/opinion/kamala-harris-criminal-justice.html">pushed to uphold wrongful convictions</a> that had been won through prosecutorial misconduct. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I do think that [the prosecutor versus felon] framing glosses over a lot of the nuances of what prosecutors do,” said Wanda Bertram, a communications strategist at the Prison Policy Initiative. And it’s coming at “a time when we have really only just begun to see the gains from electing actual progressive prosecutors.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this means that Harris should avoid mentioning Trump’s crimes. To the contrary, that’s exactly what her campaign should focus on when drawing a contrast between the candidates. But to do it effectively, Democrats need to move past broadly painting Trump as a “felon” and talk more specifically about what Trump actually did — and how his corruption defrauded voters. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The problem with reducing a race between two candidates to the prosecutor versus the felon is it’s turning the election and the choice voters have in front of them into a soundbite instead of an actual judgment on the values and the platform and the policies that either candidate runs on and owns,” Rahman, of Vera Action, said. “And voters deserve more and want more than soundbites.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While the video that played at the DNC Monday night looked like a cheesy ad from a law-and-order campaign, it also highlighted why Trump has been held liable in civil court and convicted in criminal court for his misdeeds. “He lies, he rips off workers, he sexually abuses women,” the video said. “He cheats in business, he cheated on his wife with a pornstar and paid her off so the American people wouldn’t find out during an election.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The more specific Harris is, the more effective her message will be. After all, being convicted of a felony doesn’t disqualify someone from running for public office, and it shouldn’t mean that someone is inherently unfit to serve anyway. But the specifics of what Trump did — the lies and the fraud — make a more compelling case against him than any one label could.</p>

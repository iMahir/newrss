</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">At the end of the vice presidential debate, Gov. Tim Walz asked Sen. JD Vance a pointed question: Did Donald Trump <a href="https://x.com/AccountableGOP/status/1841307376655253614">lose the 2020 election</a>? Vance’s response: “Tim, I’m focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is a clear right answer&nbsp;— that the 2020 presidential election was in fact legitimate —&nbsp;and Vance refused to offer it. It was, as Walz immediately noted, “A damning non-answer,” one that showed viewers who JD Vance is and what he stands for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, every issue discussed earlier that night comes in second to the fundamental question of whether America’s democratic institutions deserve to endure. On that question, Vance truly is radical, and his exposure as such was the only truly important moment of the night.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many Republicans have embraced Trump’s lies about the last election. Some have done so reluctantly, but Vance has been enthusiastic. He has, among other things, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/08/politics/fact-check-jd-vance-capitol-charges/index.html">fundraised for January 6 rioters</a> and said he would have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/02/05/vance-trump-upend-democracy/">illegally thrown the 2020 election result to Congress</a> had he been in Mike Pence’s position at the time.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But what’s most distinctive about Vance is the degree to which he has paired 2020 conspiracy theories with <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360283/jd-vance-trump-vp-vice-president-authoritarian">a coterie of other anti-democratic positions and ideologies</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/abc-host-abruptly-ends-interview-jd-vance-supreme-court-remarks-no-no-george">a 2021 podcast interview</a>, Vance said that Trump should “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat” in the US government and “replace them with our people.” If the Supreme Court intervened, Vance suggested that Trump simply ignore the ruling and dare the Court to stop him. In the interview, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23373795/curtis-yarvin-neoreaction-redpill-moldbug">he explicitly cited Curtis Yarvin</a> — a Silicon Valley blogger who advocates for overthrowing democracy and replacing it with a form of monarchy —&nbsp;as an influence on his views in this area.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this should come as a surprise. Anti-democratic radicalism has been central to Vance’s political identity since he began running for Senate in Ohio, widely discussed since he was tapped to be Trump’s vice president earlier this year.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, it wasn’t central to the vice presidential debate tonight. The moderators left it until the very last minutes of the event, only coming up after <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-to-watch-vp-debate-2024/">the debate was originally scheduled to end</a>. Despite democracy being at the core of the difference between the two candidates onstage&nbsp;— in fact, the core ideological difference between the two parties today — it was treated as an afterthought.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In doing so, the moderators created an illusion of normalcy: allowing the two candidates to civilly discuss issues like housing and the deficit in a basically standard-politician manner, when in fact they disagree on an existential question about the nature of American government itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth dwelling on Vance’s attempt at deflection — the confusing line about Harris trying to “censor Americans from speaking their mind” on the Covid-19 pandemic — because I think it’s essential to understanding the ideological scaffolding of anti-democratic politics on the right today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are multiple theories on the right about how the Biden administration colluded with Big Tech to censor Americans, and it wasn&#8217;t exactly clear which particular one Vance was referencing. For present purposes, the details of the issue are less important than the ideological role they play.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For Vance and others like him, it is essential to do more than just insist that Trump was right in 2020 — to go the extra mile and say that Democrats are the true threat to democracy in America today. That argument, the claim that he and Trump are democracy’s real defenders, serves as justification for taking aggressive action to seize power.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When Vance proposed to “fire every single mid-level bureaucrat” in 2021, he didn’t sell it as a naked power grab. Rather, he positioned it as a kind of counter-offensive: a necessary response to the left’s alleged stranglehold over the “deep state” in Washington. The rallying cry of Trump’s campaign to overthrow the 2020 election wasn’t that democracy was illegitimate, but rather that Trump had been robbed of his authentic victory by Democratic cheating. Stop the steal!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The argument that “Democrats are worse” does more than just legitimize power grabs. It also is a powerful disciplining tool for wavering Republicans, the kind that aren’t on board with Trump or Vance’s rough-and-tumble politics. If they waver or blanch, the response that Democrats are <em>more dangerous</em> helps bring them back onside — producing <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/09/national-reviews-biden-profile-is-anti-anti-trumpism-as-art.html">the phenomenon known as anti-anti-Trumpism</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In just one moment, in short, the veneer of normalcy carefully built up over the past 90 minutes was punctured. Vance not only exposed the true center of his candidacy, but also some of the key ideological scaffolding underpinning the Republican Party’s turn into anti-democratic territory.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What makes Tucker tick?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One question I get asked about JD Vance is “does he really believe the things he says?” It’s an intriguing question, but in some ways an irrelevant one: What matters about a politician is less what they “truly believe” in their secret hearts than what they say in public.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The same goes for one of the men reportedly instrumental in Vance’s elevation: Tucker Carlson. A longtime Washington journalist turned ludicrous Trump-aligned demagogue, discussing “what happened to Tucker” is one of the capital city’s most popular guessing games —&nbsp;if an ultimately pointless and unanswerable one.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet journalist John McCormack’s recent piece on the subject —&nbsp;titled “<a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/what-happened-tucker-carlson/">What Happened to Tucker Carlson?</a>” —&nbsp;is nonetheless worth your time. While ultimately concluding that its titular question is impossible to answer, McCormack manages to shed a great deal of light on who Tucker is and the thoroughgoing nature of his political transformation. It’s very much worth reading.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Workers at ports on the East and Gulf Coasts went on strike Tuesday following a breakdown in negotiations between the union representing them, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA), and the organization of international shipping companies that employ them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Approximately 45,000 workers walked off the job at 12:01 am, making it the most significant strike the union <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977">has engaged in since 1977</a>. On Tuesday, workers at 36 different ports stopped work after their six-year contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired — and depending on how long the work stoppage lasts, it could have a monumental impact on the US economy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The strike affects some of the country’s biggest ports, like the<a href="https://gothamist.com/news/dockworkers-at-port-of-ny-and-nj-go-on-strike-for-first-time-since-1977"> Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>. Overall, the affected ports handle about 50 percent of the imports and exports to the US. Though some of that cargo has been preemptively diverted to the West Coast, that isn’t a solution without complications.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In recent days, it appeared as though USMX and ILA were moving forward with negotiations, with USMX requesting to extend the current contract to garner more negotiating time. ILA, though, refused the new proposal.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">ILA president Harold Daggett warned Tuesday that the union was “prepared to fight as long as necessary, to stay out on strike for whatever period of time it takes, to get the wages and protections against automation our ILA members deserve.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the </strong>International Longshoremen’s Association? Why are its members <strong>striking?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The ILA represents the approximately 45,000 workers who manage the unloading of massive shipping containers from large cargo ships. Eventually, inventory from the ships makes its way to warehouses, store shelves, and factories. The members work at ports up and down the East Coast as far north as Maine, as well as Gulf Coast ports in Louisiana and Texas.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s a strike over two main issues,” Art Wheaton, director of labor studies at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said. “One is money. Two is technology.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The union has demanded a significant pay raise for dock workers over the six-year life of the contract, as well as increased contributions to their retirement plan and a say in the role of automation in their industry. Some reports indicate the union asked for as much <a href="https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-pay-automation-ports-jobs-consumers-3aa66e0a05db25a49645fad404a5f000">as a 77 percent pay increase</a>; the most recent proposal from USMX offered a 50 percent increase over the life of the contract.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The biggest concern is, the dock workers do not want automated machines to be responsible for picking up, dropping off, and releasing the cargo automatically,” Wheaton said. “They would like to have a human operator there” to ensure the quality and safety of their operations — and job security. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Negotiations between USMX and ILA for a new contract stopped in June, reportedly over the use of <a href="https://mynbc15.com/news/local/hundreds-of-mobile-dockworkers-set-to-go-on-strike">automation at a port in Mobile, Alabama</a>. USMX filed a complaint with the National Labor Review Board last week claiming that ILA refused to continue with contract negotiations. USMX did not respond to Vox’s request for comment.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Shipping companies that compose USMX — all of which are based abroad — have made billions as global trade and shipping has boomed, the union argues, while worker wages have stagnated in the face of inflation. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Dock workers on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/business/economy/port-strike-economy.html">West Coast make about $55 per hour compared</a> with the East and Gulf Coast <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/01/business/us-port-workers-strike-tuesday/index.html">average of $39 per hour</a> for experienced workers. West Coast dockworkers received an impressive <a href="https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract">wage increase</a> in their most recent contract<a href="https://www.portoflosangeles.org/references/2023-news-releases/news_083123_ilwu_contract">;</a> they belong to a different union, the International Longshoremen and Warehouse Union (ILWU), which has long been much more radical than the ILA in terms of its politics, demands, and tactics, according to Gabe Winant, a labor historian at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the ILWU workers’ big wage wins proved that it was possible to demand more — and get it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, the ILA hopes to achieve a similar victory.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Which goods will be impacted?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">More than 50 percent of all goods <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/east-coast-port-strike-what-to-know/">imported into the US using container ships</a> come in through the East and Gulf Coast ports, and nearly 70 percent of containerized exports leave through them. In the immediate term, there should be few shortages or price increases on most consumer goods; many companies have made preparations for the strike. But depending how long the strike continues, some perishable items might be more expensive or difficult to come by.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have all these perishable goods coming imported [to] the East Coast,” like blueberries, bananas, and fish from South America, Chris Tang, a professor of supply chain management at UCLA, told Vox. “We also have apparel, toys, electronics, we import through the East Coast.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The automotive industry is also likely to be impacted, as many cars and car parts are imported from Europe. “There’s still some inventories available in the car manufacturing, and as well as the car dealers, so in the short term, it is not a major impact,” Tang said. But if the strike goes on for weeks, that inventory will run out, and car repairs could become more challenging as parts shipments are delayed.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to the strike, there are other factors affecting global shipping at the moment, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/videos/24113479/what-the-red-sea-ship-attacks-are-really-about">Houthi attacks in the Red Sea</a> that have disrupted shipping since November of last year, as has <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/374867/hurricane-helene">extreme weather</a>. The Panama Canal has also been impacted independent of the strikes; the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/14/business/panama-canal-drought.html">waterway is suffering from a drought</a>, which has created a shipping backlog there.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“As anyone who tried to buy toilet paper during the pandemic can tell you, we have a delicate supply chain, and when you start messing with the cargo ships, the rail, and the semi trucks, you&#8217;re toast,” Wheaton said. “You just aren&#8217;t going to get anything moved. Add to that that you just had a huge chunk of the East Coast get buried in water from the hurricane that just went through.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, consumers shouldn’t worry too much about goods becoming scarce. For now, Tang cautions people not to hoard products for fear that they’ll be absent from US shelves; that will create shortages and drive up prices independent of the strike.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How might the dockworker’s strike end?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What happens with the strike largely depends on how quickly the ILA and USMX can come to an agreement.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Federal law gives Congress and the president the power to break strikes in certain circumstances. In this case, President Joe Biden could order dockworkers back to the ports for 80 days as USMX and the ILA continue contract negotiations through powers granted by the Taft-Hartley Act, but <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839">he doesn’t want to do so</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tang cautions that could change the longer the strike goes on, given it could continue till the presidential election. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The administration will face “pressure from the consumers, from the retailers, from the manufacturers, and also the shipping companies” to take action and reopen the ports, Tang said. Some business groups are <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/10/01/biden-administration-dockworker-strike-00181839">already calling on Biden</a> to send ILA members back to work. But Biden has also been largely supportive of union action, save the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/11/29/23484623/congress-rail-strike-biden-sick-days">2022 railway workers strike</a>, and a number of unions are helping with <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/372935/teamsters-union-harris-biden-uaw-labor-trump-endorsement-vote">Vice President Harris’s campaign</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think that right now, President Biden is under large pressure,” Tang said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ideally, the administration won’t have to act, with ILA and USMX coming to an agreement either on their own or with US officials assisting with negotiations. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The official policy of the government for more than 100 years, that the best solution is a negotiated solution,” Wheaton said. “The union won&#8217;t get everything they want, management won&#8217;t get everything they want, but you sit at the bargaining table to see what both sides can live with.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s been more than a week since the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit">arrest of music mogul and rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs</a> on a litany of federal charges including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, but the questions surrounding the allegations have only grown in recent days.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which of Combs’s many celebrity friends heard about the alleged “freak-offs”? What, if anything, did his former romantic partners, including Jennifer Lopez, know? If there are tapes, what’s on them?&nbsp;Why do people keep talking about Justin Bieber?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not a stretch to draw parallels between Combs’s case and that of notorious sex offender <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/7/7/20685023/billionaire-jeffrey-epstein-arrested-minor-sex-trafficking-charges">Jeffrey Epstein</a>. Copious amounts of money, a long list of powerful friends, and a culture of celebrity silence make for a potent combination that, as <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/8/14/20803950/jeffrey-epstein-conspiracy-theories-clinton-trump-acosta">Anna has written</a>, is “tailor-made to produce conspiracy theories.” In the wake of the arrest, amateur internet sleuths have surfaced numerous videos and photos and pored over interviews with Diddy and his&nbsp;celebrity associates in search of answers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, the allegations against Combs continue to pile up. After several civil lawsuits were filed against Combs late last year, another woman came forward in late September<strong> </strong>to allege <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sean-combs-diddy-lawsuit-1e2b124ba85ebf1b4f1e93c8692aab4b">in a 26-page civil suit</a> that Combs and his bodyguard took her to the recording studio for his record label, Bad Boy, in 2001, raped her repeatedly, and recorded the assault.  After putting out a call for additional victims — and netting more than 3,000 responses — lawyers announced on October 1 that they would be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/10/01/diddy-sexual-assault-lawsuit-victims-tony-buzbee/">filing 120 additional civil lawsuits</a> against Combs and several codefendants in New York, Los Angeles, and Miami in the following weeks. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As court filings become public, they promise to unfurl a whole new set of allegations against Combs and offer new details on previously unknown accusations going back decades. The sheer scope of the cases and inclusion of codefendants, plus allegations that Combs used his entertainment business to lure victims, could turn Combs’s case into one of the biggest Me Too reckonings the music industry has seen.<strong>   </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Through his lawyers, Diddy has repeatedly asserted that the civil claims against him are baseless, calling several of them “sickening allegations” made “by individuals looking for a quick payday.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He has pleaded not guilty in the criminal case, too, and is currently being held in a Brooklyn jail after twice being denied bail. His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, has said the rapper is “going to fight this with all of his energy and all of his might,” and during a court hearing argued that the so-called freak-offs — marathon sexual productions that prosecutors say involved hired sex workers and women coerced to perform sexual acts for the gratification of Combs and others — were consensual, if unconventional.&nbsp;“Is it sex trafficking?” he asked in court last week. “No, not if everybody wants to be there.” &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>With so many players, civil and criminal cases, and plenty of misinformation floating around, we’re pulling together some of the most frequently asked questions about Diddy and trying to answer them — as best we can, of course, given what we know.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For a more detailed history of all the allegations against Diddy, check out Anna’s full explainer <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Combs accused of?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Combs is facing two kinds of cases: one criminal case brought by the federal government and several civil cases brought by individuals, each involving different accusations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Combs was arrested on criminal charges; the government alleges that he used his business enterprise to conduct criminal activity, including sex trafficking and kidnapping, and then used his power to intimidate victims and cover up the crimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case centers on the alleged performances with women and sex workers. The indictment alleges that Diddy often transported sex workers to perform in the sessions and taped the encounters to coerce silence from participants, using an array of employees and his business organization to facilitate the criminal activity. For all of this, they’ve charged Combs with racketeering conspiracy: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-r-kelly-keith-raniere-prosecutions.html">a powerful charge</a> that was originally used largely to prosecute organized crime leaders and can result in a hefty sentence.&nbsp;<br><br>It was the civil cases, however, that opened the floodgates that ultimately led to the indictment.<br><br>In November 2023, Combs’s ex-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, also known as the singer Cassie, <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/24006759/puffy-diddy-sean-combs-video-cassie-rape-lawsuit">filed the first explosive lawsuit</a> that exposed several allegations against Combs to the public, including that the rapper orchestrated the performances with sex workers and forced her to participate. Though she filed a civil case (which was settled by Combs within one day), Ventura’s allegations appear to be the central foundation of the federal criminal case against Combs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Four other cases were filed shortly thereafter, three by women who alleged that he raped them (in some cases drugging them), and one by a male music producer who accused Diddy of grooming him and coercing him to hire sex workers for sex. <br><br>After Combs’s arrest, a team of lawyers led by the law firms of Tony Buzbee and Andrew Van Arsdale put out a call looking for other potential victims, and announced that they would be proceeding with 120 additional civil lawsuits that would be filed in the weeks to come. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>If so many people were involved, why did it take so long for the allegations to come out?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Combs was incredibly powerful in the music industry and in American culture more generally. ​​&nbsp; He was one of the first people to blend the worlds of hip-hop, business, and luxury. His fashion label, Sean John, founded in 1998, became <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/09/09/sean-combs-puff-daddy-p-diddy-i-am-fashion">known for high-end menswear</a>. He promoted brands of vodka and tequila and hosted exclusive <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/diddy-white-party-turns-20-pictures-hamptons-8342051/">white parties</a> in the Hamptons with guests like Martha Stewart, Sarah Jessica Parker, Matthew Broderick, and Jay Z.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s difficult for people to speak out about sexual assault under any circumstances, and doubly difficult when the alleged perpetrator is someone wealthy and well-connected who may have influence over their careers. Combs is also accused of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-indicted.html">running an enormous criminal “enterprise”</a> that threatened women with blackmail and violence — including using firearms to threaten victims — all of which would have made it even more difficult for anyone to come forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s on the tapes mentioned in the indictment? Will they ever come out?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Several of the accusers, and the criminal indictment, allege that Diddy videotaped sexual assaults and the performances with sex workers. The accuser this week alleges that a tape made of her sexual assault <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sean-diddy-combs-accuser-drugged-bound-rape-lawsuit-1235109972/">was sold</a> and viewed by several other men.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Generally, accusers have said any tapes served as a way to ensure their silence. In court, the New York Times reported, prosecutors presented <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html">a statement from one</a> who said, “He just threatened me about my sex tapes that he has of me on two phones. He said he would expose me, mind you these sex tapes where I am heavily drugged.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is everyone talking about baby oil? Is this real?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One of the odder details in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/8a5e00b3-6871-456f-b787-736298a5c2d7.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_6">the Combs indictment</a> is that authorities say they seized “more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant” in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/25/entertainment/sean-combs-home-search/index.html">searches of the mogul’s residences</a> in Miami and Los Angeles earlier this year. Prosecutors say the oil was meant for the performances, and Ventura also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html">said in her lawsuit</a> that she was told to pour “excessive” amounts of oil on herself at these events.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Possessing baby oil is not a crime, and the whole oil issue doesn’t matter very much in the context of the violent and disturbing conduct of which Combs has been accused. But a federal indictment of a public figure like Combs is meant to be read, and it’s not unusual for prosecutors to include details they know will shock people and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/22/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-freakoffs-sex-drugs.html">make headlines</a>. Baby oil did the trick.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are other celebrities connected to the case?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s important to note that no other person, celebrity or not, has been indicted alongside Combs in the criminal case. The civil cases filed so far<strong> </strong>do not mention any other celebrities either, accusing only Combs and occasionally those employed by him.  <br><br>But with the announcement on October 1 of the additional 120 civil lawsuits, lawyers told the media that the cases would include a number of codefendants. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2024/10/01/diddy-sexual-assault-lawsuit-victims-tony-buzbee/">According to the Washington Post, </a>they claimed that those codefendants would include “members of Combs’s family, record labels, event venues and Combs’s associates,”  and that the list would include “household names.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, this is an incredibly tough question, tending to spark more rumor and innuendo than uncover any truths, as onlookers try to determine who knew what when. Indeed, Combs had many friends in high places. But pursuing the question tends to spawn misinformation, like a <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/viral-justin-bieber-song-about-diddy-party-likely-ai/">viral song about “a Diddy party”</a> attributed to Justin Bieber that experts now say was likely created by AI.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, a few bold-faced names who were on the guest lists at Combs’s celeb-packed “<a href="https://pagesix.com/2024/09/23/celebrity-news/inside-sean-diddy-combs-wild-parties-leonardo-dicaprio-sarah-jessica-parker-j-lo-more-spotted-in-resurfaced-pics/">white parties</a>” have <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/what-celebs-have-said-about-diddys-infamous-parties/">come forward to say they</a> were in no way connected to any of the crimes Combs is accused of. But it’s best if we all give the conspiracy theories a rest, wait for legal filings to learn more, and let the case be handled in court. Wild speculation is only liable to exacerbate the victims’ pain.  </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What will happen to Combs’s businesses and brands now?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the weeks before Ventura’s lawsuit went public last November, Diddy made several media-grabbing moves, including donating $1 million to Howard University, performing and collecting a Global Icon Award at the VMAs, and throwing a high-profile birthday party for himself in London with Naomi Campbell and Idris Elba among the guests.<br><br>So much has since crumbled, not the least of which is his business empire. Diageo, the beverage brand with which Combs once partnered on vodka and tequila, quickly removed his image from its website, and the partnership broke ties after <a href="https://apnews.com/article/diddy-diageo-tequila-deleon-ciroc-3b554f9d03e007139484a6c7e0cf5bd4">settling a lawsuit</a> over another matter this January. Capital Preparatory Schools, a New York charter school network Combs helped expand, posted a statement on the school’s website last fall saying it was cutting ties with him (though the statement was later removed). Combs also stepped aside as chair of Revolt, a TV network he helped start in 2013, and then officially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/04/arts/music/sean-combs-diddy-sell-stake-revolt.html">sold his stake</a> this summer. And Sean John’s website, according to the Daily Beast, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/sean-combs-scandal-fallout-diddys-couture-website-sean-john-has-gone-totally-offline">was taken down</a>.<br><br>According to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/sean-diddy-combs-dropped-steps-down-lawsuit.html">New York magazine</a>, he also no longer has a dedicated “Sean Diddy Combs Day” in Miami, returned his key to New York City, and had his planned Hulu show iced.<br><br>As for Howard, his alma mater? It returned the million-dollar gift.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If<strong> Diddy is convicted, how long could he be in prison?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s no guarantee that Combs’s case will go to trial or that he’ll be convicted if he does, so at this point it’s impossible to guess the outcome. But the Department of Justice has issued a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/sean-combs-charged-manhattan-federal-court-sex-trafficking-and-other-federal-offenses">list of the charges</a> against Combs and what each could mean if he’s convicted. Unsurprisingly, the maximum sentences range, with a transportation for purposes of prostitution charge bringing a potential 10-year sentence, and that racketeering conspiracy charge meaning Combs could face life in prison. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, October 1, 4:30 pm: </em></strong><em>This piece was originally published on September 26 and has been updated to include an additional 120 civil lawsuits filed against Combs and various codefendants. </em></p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel has begun a military invasion of Lebanon it said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/09/30/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-war-news-gaza/">would be “limited,”</a> following days of bombing campaigns near and within the capital, Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share">said</a> that it had moved one army division, typically numbering around 10,000 troops, to the Lebanese border and told Lebanese civilians in about two dozen villages in the area to move north.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That invasion marks a dangerous new phase in the long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed Islamist militant organization and Lebanese political party that has fought Israel since its founding decades ago. Israel has recently escalated its attacks on Hezbollah, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/28/23935157/hezbollah-lebanon-israel-hamas-palestine-gaza-iran-militia-group">assassinating the group’s reclusive leader</a>, Hassan Nasrallah, in a bombing in a Beirut suburb on Friday after reportedly launching a <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372399/pager-explosions-lebanon-syria-hezbollah-israel-gaza">series of attacks on thousands of mobile devices</a> used by members of Hezbollah throughout Lebanon. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s latest operations have been costly: More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/israel-strikes-yemen-lebanon-attack-hezbollah-middle-east-war-latest">1,000 Lebanese have been killed, 6,000 wounded</a>, and as many as a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o">million displaced</a> in recent weeks, according to Lebanese government officials. Hezbollah’s recent attacks on Israel — largely missile strikes — have meanwhile left at least <a href="https://www.jns.org/idf-probing-cause-of-sirens-in-central-israel/">eight</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24452/hezbollah-fires-missile-tel-aviv">people</a> wounded in the last week.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the two sides have fought on and off over the decades, Hezbollah has been engaged in more intense fighting with Israel since the October 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas last year. Hezbollah has vowed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas/here-are-the-latest-developments-on-strikes-in-lebanon?smid=url-share">continue its missile strikes</a> into Israeli territory until Israel agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza, where at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-death-toll-how-many-palestinians-has-israels-campaign-killed-2024-07-25/">40,000 Palestinians</a> have been killed. Israel has shown no sign it is contemplating ending its operations, either. The country’s leaders have said they want to <a href="https://www.vox.com/today-explained-podcast/352059/why-israel-cant-destroy-hamas">completely eradicate Hamas</a>, and Israel’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/30/us-looks-unable-to-talk-netanyahu-out-of-planned-invasion-of-lebanon">defense minister said Monday</a> that the “next stage in the war against Hezbollah will begin soon.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Key allies also seem unable to end the fighting. The United States reportedly had a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/30/us/politics/us-israel-lebanon-hezbollah.html">Hezbollah-Israel peace plan that it has now abandoned</a>. While the US has publicly told Israel it should try to deescalate the situation, the US <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/30/us-israel-military-hezbollah-00181797">reportedly privately offered Israel support</a> for its Hezbollah strategy. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Iranian officials have responded to Israel’s recent attacks with a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/iran-launched-ballistic-missile-attack-israel-rcna173434">ballistic missile strike</a> on Tuesday. Iran’s mission to the UN suggested the country did not have further attacks in store, <a href="https://x.com/Iran_UN/status/1841162849286308106">writing on X</a> that the country’s “response … has been duly carried out,” though it added the threat: “Should the Zionist regime dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here is what we do know so far about what has happened, and what’s likely to come next.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The animosity between Hezbollah and Israel is decades old; in fact, Hezbollah formed in <a href="https://merip.org/1982/09/the-war-in-lebanon/">1982 in southern Lebanon</a> as a response to <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/6/4/a-cosmic-stink-israels-invasion-of-lebanon-40-years-on">Israel’</a>s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1982/09/03/war-casualties-put-at-48000-in-lebanon/cf593941-6067-4239-a453-71bdcaf9eba0/">disastrous invasion</a>, which killed tens of thousands of Lebanese, and subsequent decades-long occupation of that area. Hezbollah <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/may/24/israelandthepalestinians.lebanon">waged guerilla warfare against Israeli troops for decades</a>, and Israel finally left in 2000 following years of brutal fighting and a UN resolution requiring it to do so. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The two sides settled into a conflict that simmered until 2006. After Hezbollah killed eight Israeli soldiers and captured two others, Israel responded with a counterattack that led to a short, bloody war in which <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/echoes-of-2006-israel-hezbollah-and-the-potential-for-regional-war/">more than 1,000 Lebanese and 160 Israelis were killed</a>.<strong> </strong>A UN-brokered ceasefire ended that conflict, but fighting continued for years — and it intensified again in the wake of Hamas’s October 7 attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is allied with Hamas, and, starting on October 8, 2023, began firing major salvos into northern Israel, eventually displacing around <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglkkrj94ldo">60,000 residents there</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Initially, with Israel focused on uprooting Hamas in Gaza, fighting along its northern border with Lebanon was limited to tit-for-tat strikes. But starting in September, Israel escalated the fighting significantly, first by attacking Hezbollah members and leadership with exploding electronics, then bombing Hezbollah’s stronghold in southern Lebanon and the outskirts of Beirut.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ever since the October 7 attack, observers have warned about the possibility that Israel’s war with Gaza might spread to encompass Hezbollah and, perhaps, the entire region. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s not clear if that’s what’s happening now or what a full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah might look like. Despite Hezbollah’s previous ability to stand up to Israeli firepower, it’s also not clear how it will fare with its communication networks disrupted by <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/372772/hezbollah-israel-pagers-radios-lebanon">the recent pager and walkie-talkie attacks</a> — which Israel has not claimed but is widely assumed to be behind. What’s more, a significant number of mid-level and senior Hezbollah leaders were killed in that attack and <a href="https://www.vox.com/israel/373428/lebanon-hezbollah-israel-hamas-gaza">subsequent bombings</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What might Hezbollah’s next move be?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hezbollah is considered the most widely armed and powerful militia group in the Middle East. It boasts a vast weapons arsenal, including as many as <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/9/20/hezbollah-to-israel-precision-missiles-now-obtained">120,000 missiles</a>, and has deployed it with increasing success inside Israel’s borders since the war in Gaza began. Israel <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollahs-tunnels-flexible-command-weather-israels-deadly-blows-2024-09-25/">claims to have destroyed thousands of the group’s rockets and shells</a>, and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/people/natan-sachs/">Natan Sachs</a>, director of the Middle East policy program at the Brookings Institution, says Israel may have destroyed some of Hezbollah’s precision munitions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Hezbollah has demonstrated advanced military tactics such as <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/hezbollah-introduces-new-weapons-tactics-against-israel-as-war-in-gaza-drags-on">using drones to fire missiles at key Israeli targets</a> and effective intelligence capabilities including <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/tool-of-first-resort-israel-hamas-war-in-cyber/">digital espionage</a>. And recent Israeli attacks on Lebanese mobile devices and the assassination of Nasrallah haven’t completely wiped out that capacity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There was kind of this gleefulness about Hezbollah being completely disabled and destroyed now because all the leadership’s gone,” said <a href="https://x.com/phillipsmyth?lang=en">Phillip Smyth</a>, an independent analyst focusing on the Middle East and terrorism. “That’s not how it works.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the success of recent Israeli attacks has called into question the extent of Hezbollah’s capabilities — and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/world/middleeast/iran-hezbollah-israel-nasrallah.html">reportedly shaken Iranian leadership</a>. In that sense, Hezbollah may have limited options going forward, even though it had previously pledged not to relent until a ceasefire in Gaza is reached.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Hezbollah turns out to be less capable, militarily, than I expected,” <a href="https://tcf.org/experts/thanassis-cambanis/">Thanassis Cambanis</a>, a senior fellow and director of the think tank Century International, said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Cambanis and other experts believed that Hezbollah had the technology to effectively strike military targets in Israel, as well as civilian infrastructure in Haifa and even Tel Aviv, a major population center. But if it was willing and able, it seems it would have done so by now.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“It turns out that Hezbollah wasn’t willing to use its most powerful military options, or that it couldn’t because Israel was able to infiltrate or neutralize Hezbollah capabilities,” Cambanis said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The group’s second-in-command, Naim Qassem, sought to dispel doubts about Hezbollah’s capabilities in a speech on Monday, though he also seemed to suggest Hezbollah is currently on the defensive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Israel was not able to reach our military capabilities, and what its media says about hitting most of the medium and long-range capabilities is a dream they have not achieved and will never achieve,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCVhaCv-BSQ">Qassem said</a>. “We will face any possibility and we are ready if the Israelis decide to enter by land and the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He added that an announcement will be <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-says-choose-nasrallahs-successor-at-earliest-opportunity">made in the coming days</a> about Nasrallah’s successor, who Smyth said will most likely be <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-822451">Hashem Safieddine</a>, Nasrallah’s handpicked heir and cousin. Safieddine currently oversees&nbsp; Hezbollah’s political affairs and sits on the council managing the group’s military operations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is Iran’s role here?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Tuesday’s missile barrage is Iran’s most escalatory move since April, when the regime sent around 300 missiles and rockets toward Israel, nearly all of which were intercepted by US and regional partner forces, as well as Israel’s own air defenses.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the most part, Iran asserts its regional power and carries out foreign policy goals —&nbsp;primarily, antagonizing Israel —&nbsp;by funding and providing resources to a network of militia groups. Those include Hamas, Yemen’s Houthi rebels, Shia militia groups in Iraq and Syria, and, of course, Hezbollah.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Iran’s relationship with Hezbollah is really like two NATO allies,” Ali Vaez, director of the Iran project at the International Crisis Group, <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/14/23917078/israel-hamas-war-gaza-iran-hezbollah-khamenei-lebanon">told Vox</a> last October.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, while NATO allies pledge to defend one another from attacks, Iran has been reluctant to be actively involved in a war against Israel; a drone attack on Israeli territory in April, following the assassination of an Iranian military leader in an Iranian diplomatic building in Damascus, Syria, was obviously telegraphed and minimally destructive. And the July assassination of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-hamas-israel-30968a7acb31cd8b259de9650014b779">Ismail Haniyeh</a>, the former Hamas leader, while he was in Tehran prompted no obvious retaliation.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s not to say that Iran has no appetite for conflict: “The appetite for them was quite high, to be perfectly frank,” Smyth said.&nbsp;“They just thought that they could micromanage this so that it wouldn’t get to this point. And the Israelis clearly called their bluff.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, it seems, Iran has offered a show of force — but there are limits to how far the country will go.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Escalation could come, but [the Iranians] need to thread a needle,” Sachs said. That involves trying to show solidarity with Hezbollah and that Iran is capable of attack, without getting into an extended war with both Israel and the US.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is Israel’s Lebanon campaign a prelude to a larger ground invasion?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel’s plan for its “limited” ground invasion involves rooting out Hezbollah along Lebanon’s southern border with Israel to neutralize the threat to Israeli communities nearby, the <a href="https://wapo.st/3XO98KS">Washington Post reported</a>. So far, the Israeli military <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/here-are-the-latest-developments?smid=url-share">said</a> it has conducted “limited, localized and targeted raids” along the border.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s a fear that Israel’s narrow mission could balloon into something bigger — much as it already has in Gaza, where Israel’s stated operational objective of eliminating Hamas has given way to widespread destruction of civilian life. If the conflict with Hezbollah does grow, that would likely spur fierce Lebanese resistance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“An invasion of Lebanon will mobilize Lebanese as a national issue to resist, including the many Lebanese who don’t support Israel but also oppose another Israeli invasion and occupation,” Cambanis said. “Perhaps in the short term Israel can achieve some of its aims by pursuing the logic of total war, but it will only make Israel and the entire Middle East less safe.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Lebanese government —&nbsp;or what passes for it, since an unelected caretaker government has been in place since 2022 — has clearly demonstrated that the country is not interested in yet another war with Israel. Caretaker <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-hold-session-elect-president-after-ceasefire-caretaker-pm-says-2024-09-30/">Prime Minister Najib Mikati announced Monday</a> that his government is prepared to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended the 2006 war. That resolution would deploy the Lebanese army to the country’s south to crack down on Hezbollah and require Israel to pull out of southern Lebanon. Now that Israel has entered Lebanon, it’s unclear whether Mikati will trigger the resolution. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The conflict has already taken a significant toll on Lebanese civilians and it could only get worse from here. In anticipation, Lebanon and the United Nations petitioned for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/10/01/world/israel-lebanon-hezbollah/23dd80ed-e9dd-5ee3-a552-622fbac870f6?smid=url-share">$426 million</a> in humanitarian aid on Tuesday to help those affected in the next three months.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Lebanon has already struggled under decades of war and government dysfunction, as well as an influx of Syrian refugees that have stretched already-limited state capacity. Now, Israel’s bombing attacks and invasion have displaced around 1 million Lebanese from the south of the country, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgveeyrl47o">according to Mikati</a>, and the Lebanese government says <a href="https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-09-30-2024-83ea5f243688f309754ec74850de4238">at least 1,000 people have been killed in the past two weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s next for the Gaza-Hezbollah-Israel conflict overall?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There seems to be no end in sight for the widening conflict, for several reasons: US unwillingness to restrain Israel by restricting weapons shipments; Hezbollah’s stated position that they will not stop attacks on Israel until a ceasefire with Gaza is reached; and the repeated breakdown of Gaza ceasefire talks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US and France did attempt to negotiate a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/26/lebanon-temporary-ceasefire-plan-hezbollah-israel">21-day ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel last week</a>, but “Israel (Netanyahu) has flat out rejected the US-French 21 day ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,” <a href="https://history.stanford.edu/people/joel-beinin">Joel Beinin</a>, a professor of Middle East history at Stanford University, said. As Hezbollah also frames its attacks as support for Gaza, it most likely won’t agree to a ceasefire as long as Gaza is still under attack.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As for the US, there seems to be almost no effort to truly restrain Israel following the failed ceasefire attempt.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The United States is just not driving events,” <a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/who-we-are/people/michael-wahid-hanna">Michael Hanna</a>, director of the US program at the International Crisis Group, said.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We support Israel’s right to defend itself against Hezbollah and all Iranian backed terror groups. Of course, we know that mission creep can be a risk and we will keep discussing that with the Israelis. And ultimately, a diplomatic resolution is the only way to achieve lasting stability and security across the Israel-Lebanon border,” a spokesperson from the National Security Council told Vox in an email.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The US could, however, do more to deter escalation; <a href="https://www.sanders.senate.gov/in-the-news/bernie-sanders-preparing-resolutions-to-block-20b-in-us-arms-sales-to-israel/">Sen. Bernie Sanders </a>(I-VT) has introduced <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-resolution-forces-vote-arms-sales-israel-gaza_n_66f5b5a4e4b0b663235fb66d">a resolution to block arms sales to Israel</a>, on the premise that the arms transfers violate international law, although that is unlikely to pass in Congress.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although Lebanon is the current site of the crisis, Israeli military operations are ongoing in Gaza, where <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20240711-more-than-186-000-dead-in-gaza-how-credible-are-the-estimates-published-on-the-lancet">as many as 186,000 people may have been killed in the past year of fighting</a>, according to the Lancet, a medical journal. (Many media sources put that figure at 40,000, but an accurate count is difficult given that much of Gaza is destroyed and fighting is ongoing.) Medical infrastructure has been destroyed, and there are many reported instances of communicable disease and malnutrition.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“People are getting killed in Gaza daily, the humanitarian situation is dire,” Hanna said. “Life is disrupted and on hold — there are no schools, there’s no functioning society. There’s nothing.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Israel appears to be emboldened by its victories, and Hezbollah appears reluctant to launch large-scale attacks on Israel. The US has maintained its support for Israel and is sending <a href="https://apnews.com/article/us-troops-middle-east-israel-hezbollah-e37e2dbef573e33c0f8fb6a8103f27f1">more troops to the region</a>. Iran has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-mideast-tensions-hezbollah-lebanon-analysis-5020aeed3c88790d5483fdf40c9ba392">issued some threats</a>, but hasn’t yet been much of an active participant in the fighting. All that makes it impossible to say where the war goes from here. Cambanis, however, predicts the worst.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There’s a dangerous and delusional march to war on Iran,” he said. “I would have liked to rely on the US government to restrain Israel, but it’s clear that the Biden administration supports Israel’s widening gyre of escalation.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice presidential candidates — Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz — faced off Tuesday night in the first and only scheduled vice presidential debate of the 2024 presidential election cycle. The stakes are high. Vance and Walz have just 34 days left to make their pitches to voters across the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The biggest oddity of VP debates is that, though the running mates are onstage, it’s the presidential nominees who get the lion’s share of attention. Vance and Walz will be onstage to talk up their candidate — and run down the other party’s. Vance has spent months hitting Vice President Kamala Harris on her record on the border and immigration. Walz, meanwhile, has hit Vance and former President Donald Trump on their opposition to reproductive rights, tying them to the <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">highly unpopular Project 2025</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the weekend, Hurricane Helene <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/374794/helene-flooding-hurricane-asheville-carolina">pummeled the Southeast</a>, causing sweeping devastation to areas of the country unaccustomed to such disasters. The storm <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/weather/live-blog/helene-deadly-storm-live-updates-rcna173203">destroyed homes, businesses, and roadways</a>, left <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/09/30/helene-aftermath-live-updates-monday-north-carolina/75447978007/">millions without power</a> and cell service, and stranded people in <a href="https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-asheville-f02869c7d01e68f2d7f0553abb82252f">western North Carolina in the midst of  several feet of floodwater</a>. More than <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/374794/helene-flooding-hurricane-asheville-carolina">130 deaths</a> have been reported across six states, including Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, and North Carolina.</p>

As relief continues, many across the country are looking to offer their support.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are some ways you can help the burgeoning relief effort and what to avoid in order to not hinder emergency and rescue crews on the ground in these pivotal early days.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What you can do right now</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the immediate aftermath of the storm, do not send donations or supplies that have not been specifically requested by state and local organizations, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. In <a href="https://x.com/tennesseeema/status/1840439256327827927?s=46">a statement on X</a>, TEMA said it is not accepting volunteers or donations “until the life safety mission is complete.”&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">While local communities appreciate the volunteer spirit during disasters, please DO NOT send donations that have not been requested by state or local authorities.<br><br>TEMA is not accepting volunteers or donations until the life safety mission is complete. Tennesseans, do not… <a href="https://t.co/EhrIcewCLX">pic.twitter.com/EhrIcewCLX</a></p>&mdash; Tennessee Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) (@TennesseeEMA) <a href="https://twitter.com/TennesseeEMA/status/1840439256327827927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While well-meaning, donating supplies can “further burden a community that is already in crisis,” <a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/recover/volunteer-donate">according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency</a>. If you are local to the areas impacted by Helene, connect with established local or national charitable organizations to ensure you’re donating exactly what is needed and in the necessary quantities (usually in bulk). Used clothing is never necessary, per FEMA.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">North Carolina Emergency Management <a href="https://x.com/NCEmergency/status/1840456630095184040">advised against traveling to western North Carolina</a> in order to keep roads cleared for rescue and utility crews. If you have a trip planned to an affected community in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, consider delaying or canceling your trip: <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/368920/what-to-do-natural-disaster-vacation-travel-earthquake-wildfire-hurricane-flooding">tourists may complicate search and rescue efforts.</a> The state also asks that people <a href="https://www.ncdps.gov/our-organization/emergency-management/hurricane-helene#ThestormhasnowendedandmyhomeorcommunityhasdamageWhatisnext-8119">do not send physical donations and volunteers</a>.</p>

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The best way to offer your support after a disaster is to <a href="https://www.fema.gov/disaster/recover/volunteer-donate">donate money</a>, according to FEMA. “Organizations on the ground know what items and quantities are needed, often buy in bulk with discounts and, if possible, purchase through businesses local to the disaster, which supports economic recovery,” the agency’s website says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are some organizations where you can donate funds:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://easttennesseefoundation.org/grants/neighbor-to-neighbor-disaster-relief-fund/">fund with the East Tennessee Foundation</a> supports local nonprofits and agencies dedicated to rescue and recovery.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Local chapters of the national coalition <a href="https://www.nvoad.org/hurricane-helene-response/">Voluntary Organizations Active In Disaster</a> are asking for only cash donations for recovery efforts in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</li>



<li>The <a href="https://pay.payitgov.com/ncdonations">North Carolina Disaster Relief Fund</a> helps with the “unmet needs of hurricane victims.”</li>



<li>The <a href="https://www.volunteerflorida.org/donatefdf/">Florida Disaster Fund</a> supports response and recovery activities in the state.</li>



<li><a href="https://give.helpsalvationarmy.org/give/166081/#!/donation/checkout">Donations to the Salvation Army</a> will go to the distribution of emergency aid, food, and critical supplies to survivors and rescue workers in impacted states.&nbsp;</li>



<li><a href="https://support.unitedway.org/page/Helene">Donate to the United Way,</a> where funds will be distributed to local chapters for recovery efforts.</li>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricane Helene, the Category 4 storm that slammed the American Southeast over the weekend, has killed more than 110 people — and likely millions of chickens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/fhwahop20011/chap7.htm#:~:text=In%20total%2C%20over%201.2%20million,the%20Northeast%20at%208%20percent.">Almost half</a> of the more than <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">9 billion chickens</a> farmed for meat in the US, known as “broiler” chickens, are raised and slaughtered in the region. Georgia is the nation’s top chicken producer, processing <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/Ag_Overview/stateOverview.php?state=GEORGIA">1.3 billion chickens</a> annually. Over the weekend, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-30/hurricane-helene-halts-poultry-plants-damages-pecan-trees">told</a> reporters that 107 poultry facilities in the state had been “damaged or totally destroyed by the storm.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Georgia’s Department of Agriculture didn’t respond to questions about the precise number of chickens that perished during Hurricane Helene. But given that poultry companies typically pack anywhere from<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/fad-broilers-brooding">20,000</a> <a href="https://www.aces.edu/blog/topics/farm-management/new-farmers-guide-to-the-commercial-broiler-industry-poultry-husbandry-biosecurity-basics/#:~:text=It%20is%20common%20for%20there,those%20birds%20have%20fewer%20chickens.">to 52,000 chickens</a> into each barn, which can run as big as nearly twice the length of a football field, an estimated 2.14 million to 5.56 million birds are likely to have died. (The true total could be modestly different, as some birds could’ve survived damages, and some barns could’ve been temporarily empty, as companies clear them out for a few weeks between flocks.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of the nation’s largest poultry companies — including <a href="https://www.wattagnet.com/broilers-turkeys/article/15704638/us-poultry-industry-harshly-hit-by-hurricane-helene">Aviagen</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-30/hurricane-helene-halts-poultry-plants-damages-pecan-trees">Pilgrim’s Pride</a> and <a href="https://www.porkbusiness.com/news/industry/hurricane-helene-shutters-poultry-plants-smithfield-did-not-suffer-material">Wayne-Sanderson Farms</a> — suspended operations at their local facilities due to power outages in recent days. A spokesperson for Clemson University&#8217;s agriculture program told Vox that while this is a fluid situation and it is still evaluating the hurricane’s damages, 45,000 chickens died at one South Carolina poultry operation due to generator failure.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Virtually all chickens raised for meat in the US are confined in these sprawling warehouses, which bear no resemblance to the small barns of America’s agricultural past. These factory farm operations often have at least several sheds, housing hundreds of thousands of birds on one site at the same time. If enough facilities are compromised during a natural disaster like Hurricane Helene, millions of animals can perish, their last moments likely frightening and painful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their deaths also threaten the economic health of farmers and the poultry industry. Georgia’s agriculture commissioner, Tyler Harper, has <a href="https://agr.georgia.gov/sites/default/files/documents/emergency-response/9-29-24-hurricane-helene-emergency-appropriations-letter.pdf">requested</a> immediate federal relief for the state’s agricultural sector.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When hurricanes strike factory farms, they can also flush untold amounts of animal manure into groundwater or rivers and streams, exacerbating the challenges that governments and their residents face in the wake of pounding storms.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/7Xyjx-factory-farm-animals-release-nearly-1-trillion-pounds-of-manure-annually-that-s-twice-as-much-as-humans-2.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,17.604058897911,100,64.791882204178" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Hurricane Helene is the latest — but not the first — striking, high-stakes example of how our factory farming system imposes tremendous cruelty onto animals and also imperils human health. The industry has no reason to change, even after a catastrophe like this, because taxpayers cover much of the economic loss meat companies incur from natural disasters.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">How taxpayers subsidize factory farming’s risks</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is far from the first time a hurricane has torn through the Southeast’s poultry industry. It’s happened multiple times over the last quarter-century, a period in which Big Ag has only <a href="https://www.ewg.org/research/innovative-ewg-study-uses-ai-find-357m-poultry-north-carolinas-factory-farms">doubled down</a> on building more, and bigger, factory farms.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 1999, Hurricane Floyd put much of eastern North Carolina underwater, killing an <a href="https://www.weather.gov/ilm/floyd">estimated</a> 2.4 million chickens, 100,000 pigs, and half a million turkeys. North Carolina pig farms store the animals’ waste in giant manure “lagoons,” and several <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/09/22/650698240/hurricane-s-aftermath-floods-hog-lagoons-in-north-carolina#:~:text=In%201999%2C%20flooding%20from%20Hurricane,to%20The%20New%20York%20Times.&amp;text=Hurricane%20Floyd%20forced%20North%20Carolina%20to%20make%20changes.">overflowed</a> during Floyd, sending toxic sludge containing bacteria and viruses (including <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/6/29/17517906/romaine-lettuce-e-coli-outbreak-over">E. coli</a>) into waterways and drinking water, <a href="https://climate.ncsu.edu/blog/2019/09/farmers-felt-floyds-full-force-beginning-in-onslow-county/">according</a> to the state’s climate office.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chicken factory farms store manure in giant pits or as large mounds, creating a similar pollution risk as hog farms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2016/10/25/post-matthew-water-how-bad-is-it/">Hurricane Matthew</a> in 2016 and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/21/hurricane-florence-flooding-north-carolina">Hurricane Florence</a> in 2018 also caused devastation in North Carolina, killing millions of chickens and thousands of pigs, both of which caused damage to some manure lagoons, resulting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/21/hurricane-florence-flooding-north-carolina">“fecal soup”</a> discharge. Later the same year, Hurricane Michael <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220212232153/http://agr.georgia.gov/hurricane-michael-devastates-georgias-agricultural-industry.aspx">destroyed</a> over 80 chicken barns in Georgia that housed more than 2 million chickens.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Manure can seep into groundwater and contaminate private wells that many rural communities rely on for drinking water, a perennial concern <a href="https://hazards.colorado.edu/article/hogs-and-hurricanes-while-flood-water-recedes-animal-waste-pollution-doesn-t">heightened</a> after major storms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1037412200.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.729273205801,100,78.541453588399" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A flooded hog farm in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in 2018. | Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Alex Wroblewski/Bloomberg via Getty Images" /><img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/WAM7693.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.669135487166,100,78.661729025667" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Farmed chickens died in the flooding in North Carolina after Hurricane Florence in 2018. | Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals" data-portal-copyright="Jo-Anne McArthur/We Animals" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite that history, the poultry and pork industries haven’t done much to mitigate the risks posed by natural disasters by, say, raising fewer animals on their farms or making major changes to how they manage the enormous amounts of manure their animals generate. That’s because US taxpayers bear much of the cost, both for the environmental cleanup and the dead chickens and pigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">When natural disasters hit a typical chicken farm, the meat company — which technically owns the chickens, not the farmer — receives <a href="https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/2024/fsa_lip_livestock_3_2024.pdf">$3 per mature bird</a> from the US Department of Agriculture, about 75 percent of the bird’s market value. The farmer that supplies to the meatpacker receives just 33 cents per bird.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many chicken farmers, most of whom raise birds on a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23207301/costco-rotisserie-chicken-poultry-farming-inflation">contract basis</a> for meat companies, are already toiling in precarious economic conditions. Hurricanes and other natural disasters can make it much worse.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The federal government also reimburses economic losses from other severe weather, like heat waves and cold snaps, and disease outbreaks. Over the last two years, a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu — known as H5N1 — has resulted in the death of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/data-map-commercial.html">more than 100 million</a> poultry birds, and the federal government has given well over <a href="https://www.agriculture.com/usda-has-spent-usd1-billion-fighting-bird-flu-8424034#:~:text=Since%20bird%20flu%20outbreaks%20began,Health%20Inspection%20Service%20on%20Monday.">$1 billion</a> to the poultry industry, much of it going to the largest companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Livestock production is both a <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/362224/environment-groups-meat-industry-lies-global-warming-climate-change-wwf">leading driver of climate change</a> and, as Hurricane Helene demonstrates, a victim of it. As global warming increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, policymakers should question the factory farming model. Instead, as a recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24079424/factory-farming-facts-meat-usda-agriculture-census">federal accounting</a> of the US agricultural system shows, we’re doubling down on it, raising more and more animals on bigger and bigger farms.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“In addition to all the environmental problems associated with the factory farm model, and the public health problems that it causes, at the end of the day the extreme concentration of animals is just a fundamental vulnerability,” said Chris Hunt, deputy director of the nonprofit Socially Responsible Agriculture Project. “It’s a vulnerability to unexpected shocks to the system … The fact that poultry is not only concentrated on [factory farms], but is also concentrated geographically, is certainly problematic.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The scenes from North Carolina are shocking: roads and bridges washed away. Houses ripped from their foundations. Entire towns reduced to mud and debris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Thursday night, Hurricane Helene slammed Florida as a Category 4 storm with winds reaching 140 miles per hour. Along the coast, Helene knocked down trees and power lines, and caused <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/28/helene-storm-surge-city-impact/">record storm surge</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet some of its most devastating impacts were farther inland as the storm moved across the Southeast. Even before the bulk of the storm arrived in North Carolina, Helene started dumping rain in southern Appalachia —&nbsp;and loads of it. Over the last several days some regions in western North Carolina, near the city of Asheville, recorded more than <a href="https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/discussions/nfdscc4.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawFnj-FleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHQqOqR_oagJDph7eil_N509txd3OqBKDRXp32EW-RoBFI7FQBsXg0QAghg_aem_P0uioRN-URPjEzaFxpwkmA">2.5 feet</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have biblical devastation through the county,” Ryan Cole, the assistant director of Buncombe County Emergency Services, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/UsLVoZt8WvSfqi4y/">said</a> in a press briefing Saturday afternoon. “We’ve had biblical flooding here.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far at least <a href="https://www.cnn.com/weather/live-news/hurricane-helene-florida-north-carolina-georgia-09-30-24/index.html">130 deaths</a> are linked to Helene across six states, including Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina. That number is almost certain to rise. Hundreds of people are still unaccounted for, in part because millions of households have lost power and there are still widespread cell outages. Many roads are also inaccessible, making rescue operations challenging.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stunned by the devastation, some residents <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/09/28/helene-flooding-carolinas-tennessee-destruction/">have compared</a> flooding in parts of North Carolina to the impacts from Hurricane Katrina, which made landfall in Louisiana in 2005. Katrina claimed <a href="https://www.weather.gov/mob/katrina">more than 1,800 lives</a>. In the weeks to come, Helene may become one of the deadliest US hurricanes in recent history.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, Helene is yet another reminder that climate change — which can intensify hurricanes and flooding — costs human lives. Record-warm water in the Gulf of Mexico <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/373874/hurricane-helene-florida-forecast-warm-ocean-water">supercharged the storm</a> and loaded it with moisture. Generally speaking, hot air also holds more water. Together these dynamics helped turn Helene into a deadly, super-wet storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And as these last few days have revealed, it’s not just coastal communities that are vulnerable. Asheville <a href="https://www.thenewlede.org/2022/08/dubbed-a-climate-haven-a-north-carolina-community-braces-itself/">has been dubbed a climate haven</a> —&nbsp;a refuge from the impacts of warming and its consequences. But in reality, few places are completely safe.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">1) How bad is the damage?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helene’s path of destruction began in the eastern Caribbean, where the storm formed early last week. Helene brushed Cancun as a tropical storm, flooding the streets and downing trees, before churning across the warm Gulf of Mexico and intensifying into a major hurricane. On Thursday evening, it slammed into the Big Bend of Florida —&nbsp;the region where the panhandle meets the peninsula —&nbsp;as a Category 4 storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Landfall caused record-breaking storm surge, a rise in sea level, along parts of Florida’s Gulf Coast, including in Tampa Bay and the small island of Cedar Key. Some areas saw water levels rise 15 feet above ground level, according to <a href="https://x.com/NHC_Surge/status/1839677998880227563">preliminary modeling</a> by the National Hurricane Center.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The storm left Florida <a href="https://x.com/VortixWx/status/1840740671667228942">homes in ruins</a>. Officials estimate that Helene destroyed around a quarter of all homes on Cedar Key, which lies about 130 miles north of Tampa, <a href="https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/news/2024/09/29/reality-of-hurricanes-devastation-setting-in-along-with-relief/75430622007/">according to</a> the Palm Beach Post.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of the worst damage, however, was in regions less familiar with the threat of tropical storms: the mountains of Georgia, Tennessee, and especially North Carolina. The main problem in the southeastern US was abundant, unceasing rain, which began falling before Helene made landfall in Florida. It caused rivers to swell in populated areas like Atlanta and Asheville. Asheville is the largest city in western North Carolina, with roughly 95,000 residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Videos and images over the weekend showed much of Asheville’s River Arts District —&nbsp;which hugs the French Broad River, southwest of downtown —&nbsp;utterly inundated with water, which nearly submerged buildings. Many of the shops and businesses, which are a lifeblood of the region, are unsalvageable, Will Hofmann, of the Asheville Citizen Times, <a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2024/09/29/tropical-storm-helene-floods-wipe-out-asheville-river-arts-district/75433499007/">reports</a>. In Buncombe County, which envelops Asheville, 40 people have died due to the storm and its impacts.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">State officials <a href="https://drivenc.gov/">said</a> all roads in western North Carolina, including parts of Interstate 40, were closed and should only be used by emergency vehicles. In nearby Tennessee, meanwhile, more than a dozen bridges are closed and five of them “are completely gone,” the state’s Department of Transportation <a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/v/keWHTMT8dia6dF6g/">said</a> Sunday.&nbsp;Many roads and areas in Great Smoky Mountains National Park are also <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/conditions.htm">closed</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Power outages and water shortages are also rampant across the Southeast. As of late Tuesday morning, more than 1.5 million people were without electricity across South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, and Virginia, according to <a href="http://poweroutage.us">PowerOutage.us</a>. Parts of western North Carolina are under a boil water advisory, due to a disruption in the public water supply. Repairs to Asheville’s water system could take weeks, <a href="https://www.ashevillenc.gov/news/tropical-storm-helene-recovery-resources/">officials said</a>. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-2173905556.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.736293776186,100,78.527412447627" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Rainwater filled the streets of Atlanta, Georgia on September 27. | Megan Varner/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Megan Varner/Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">2) How much will the storm cost?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, it will take weeks to get a full tally of all the damage, though initial estimates suggest it will be in the billions of dollars. <a href="https://www.corelogic.com/press-releases/corelogic-hurricane-helene-wind-storm-surge-cause-an-initial-estimated-3-5-billion-in-insured-losses/">CoreLogic</a>, an analytics firm, put its initial tally between $3 billion and $5 billion in insured losses. <a href="https://www.theinsurer.com/news/moodys-analytics-says-helene-like-idalia-but-worse-with-cost-estimated-at-up-to-34bn/">Moody’s Analytics</a> expects a toll from $20 billion to $34 billion. <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/helene-aftermath-dozens-dead-historic-flooding-millions-without-power-amid-catastrophic-destruction/1697545">AccuWeather</a>, meanwhile, is setting the price tag between $145 billion and $160 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These are all coarse initial estimates, but they indicate the magnitude of the devastation. The higher projections would put Helene in the top tier of costliest storms in the US. Hurricane Katrina, currently the most expensive weather disaster in US history, extracted about <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-633r">$170 billion from the economy</a>. <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/08/hurricane-harvey-was-years-costliest-us-disaster-125-billion-damages/">Hurricane Harvey</a> in 2017 cost about $125.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The dollar value, however, doesn’t tell the whole story. Damage estimates are typically based on insurance claims, but with rising premiums across the country, more homes and businesses are <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/06/23/americans-not-buying-homeowners-insurance/74144566007/">not seeking financial protection</a>. The insured value of a property doesn’t directly translate into suffering, either. A multimillion-dollar coastal vacation home getting swept down a hillside will register as a higher loss on an insurance company’s balance sheet than a destroyed mobile home that’s the sole residence and store of wealth for a family.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">3) Why was flooding in North Carolina so extreme?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The simplest reason is that Helene was huge, stretching more than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/26/hurricane-helene-storm-size-miles/">more than 400 miles wide</a>, so its impacts —&nbsp;the wind and rain —&nbsp;reached well beyond the eye. Most hurricanes are around <a href="https://www.weather.gov/source/zhu/ZHU_Training_Page/tropical_stuff/hurricane_anatomy/hurricane_anatomy.html">300 miles in diameter</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s more is that the storm crossed an exceptionally warm ocean before reaching the mainland. The evaporation of that warm ocean water, which sends columns of moisture into the atmosphere, is what fuels hurricanes, and loads them up with moisture that later falls as rain.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even before Helene made landfall in Florida, bands of moisture from the hurricane were pulled into Appalachia. Satellite imagery showed almost the entire East Coast shrouded in cloud cover. That means that some regions were already starting to flood even before the bulk of Helene arrived.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/1250x750.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,1.0066828416975,100,97.986634316605" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A satellite image taken on September 25. | NOAA" data-portal-copyright="NOAA" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Recent rainfall in these areas, especially the southern Appalachians, have left the grounds saturated and the river tributaries running high,” the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/communities-need-to-prepare-for-catastrophic-life-threatening-inland-flooding-from-helene-even-well">warned</a> last Wednesday. “Additional rainfall from Helene will exacerbate the existing flood risk.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also worth noting that this is a wet region of the country. The areas surrounding Asheville are temperate rainforests, full of streams and rivers that run alongside human communities.&nbsp;This underscores another point: The impacts of a storm are not simply a function of wind speed and rain totals. They’re also influenced by the amount of people and property in harm’s way and how ready they are to face a disaster.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">4) How does Helene compare to storms like Katrina and Harvey?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We know that Helene is already on course to join the ranks of the costliest storms in US history. What all those storms have in common is that they made landfall in the continental US at high intensities in populated areas: Harvey struck the Texas coast at <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/08/hurricane-harvey-was-years-costliest-us-disaster-125-billion-damages/">Category 4 strength</a>, Katrina rammed into Louisiana and Mississippi as a <a href="https://www.weather.gov/mob/katrina">Category 3 storm</a>, while Helene was a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/26/weather/video/landfall-hurricane-helene-storm-florida-john-berman-lcl-digvid">Category 4</a> when it hammered Florida’s Big Bend region.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/29/22647117/hurricane-ida-categories-explained">hurricane category ranking system</a> is mainly based on wind speed, while the most dangerous element of these storms is the sheer quantity of water in the form of rainfall and storm surge. All three of these storms caused extensive flooding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Their destruction also compounded on top of local vulnerabilities. Houston suffered intense flooding after Harvey because of the inordinate amount of rain it received, but also because the city is densely populated, relatively flat, and close to sea level. Sections of New Orleans sit below sea level and when Katrina struck, the city’s flood control infrastructure <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/orleans/how-nf.html">catastrophically failed</a>. Helene landed in Florida’s Big Bend region, which is still recovering <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23850601/hurricane-idalia-florida-wind-forecast-storm-surge-flood-rapid-intensification">from the last major hurricane</a>, before moving further inland and dumping rain on regions that have much less experience and infrastructure to cope with extraordinary volumes of water.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A <a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2024/05/07/population-growth-in-most-states-lags-long-term-trends">growing number of people</a> are also living in areas most likely to get hammered by hurricanes, and these states are building more property and infrastructure to accommodate them. That means that when a storm does make landfall, it puts more people in danger and damages more homes, offices, roads, and power lines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">5) What is the government doing to help?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Before Helene made landfall, forecasters at NOAA put out a <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/communities-need-to-prepare-for-catastrophic-life-threatening-inland-flooding-from-helene-even-well">rare news release and blunt warning</a> about the storm’s impending damage. The agency said that the hurricane would cause “catastrophic, life-threatening inland flooding.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The governors of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina heeded these alerts and submitted <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/09/27/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administrations-life-saving-and-life-sustaining-response-efforts-to-hurricane-helene/">emergency declaration requests</a> to the White House.&nbsp;Evacuation orders were issued for <a href="https://www.readync.gov/stay-informed/evacuation-orders">parts of North Carolina</a>, <a href="https://www.tn.gov/tema/news/2024/9/28/flash-report--5-hurricane-helene.html">Tennessee</a>, and <a href="https://www.flgov.com/2024/09/25/governor-ron-desantis-issues-updates-on-state-preparedness-efforts-ahead-of-hurricane-helene/">Florida</a>, but <a href="https://www.firstcoastnews.com/article/news/local/taylor-county-sheriffs-office-birthday-on-body/77-d6ee689f-bac3-445d-acc0-a7ff258f958a">some residents didn’t obey them</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Disaster declarations allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency to get involved in the response with emergency shelters, medical aid, and grants for helping people recover. More than <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/us/helene-destruction-florida-north-carolina.html">1,270 rescuers</a> were sent to the afflicted areas. States also <a href="https://www.army.mil/article/280098/national_guard_assists_with_hurricane_helene_response_in_southeast">mobilized National Guard units</a> to assist with rescue and relief efforts. During a press conference on Monday, President Joe Biden said<a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?538815-1/president-biden-remarks-federal-response-hurricane-helene"> he may have to call Congress back into session</a> to get more funding to help with the response. Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris altered their presidential <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-harris-change-campaign-plans-address-hurricane-helene/story?id=114346629">campaign schedules</a> in response to the hurricane.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/biden-pledges-help-for-helene-victims-for-as-long-as-it-takes-db864385">Trump criticized Biden</a> for not being in Washington, DC, during the storm, but Biden said he’s been following the situation and will visit areas hit hard by the disaster once rescue operations wind down. Trump is also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2024/09/29/trump-hurricane-helene-be-okay/">planning to visit Georgia</a> to get an update on the storm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ad hoc networks of local volunteers have also sprung up to provide assistance and relief, even <a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/sunday-helene-asheville-updates-death-toll-rises-schools-close-resources-coming">deploying private airplanes and helicopters</a> to bring supplies to areas now isolated by floods and destroyed roads.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">6) What did climate change have to do with it?&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s uncommon —&nbsp;though not unheard of —&nbsp;for tropical storms to travel through southern Appalachia.&nbsp;As shown in the graphic below, several systems (or their remnants) have reached this region in the last few centuries.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-30-at-9.19.16 AM.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,9.7980553477936,100,80.403889304413" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Tropical storms and hurricanes have run through western North Carolina in the past. | NOAA" data-portal-copyright="NOAA" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet it’s now well known that rising global temperatures can make the impacts of these storms much worse. Hotter air and water make the strongest hurricanes stronger and fuel <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2022/9/28/23376761/hurricane-ian-rapid-intensification-climate-change">rapid intensification</a>, where a storm’s winds pick up by 35 miles per hour or more in less than 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Warmer air holds onto more moisture, which means that hurricanes dish out more rain. A <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14oq65lavZ7ho3-gdxE-tutDEcsxSHfUj/view">rapid assessment</a> of Helene by scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory suggests that climate change caused “over 50 percent more rainfall during Hurricane Helene in some parts of Georgia and the Carolinas.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We estimate that the observed rainfall was made up to 20 times more likely in these areas because of global warming,” the scientists wrote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A hotter climate also causes sea levels to rise —&nbsp;because warm water expands and also melts polar ice —&nbsp;which worsens the impact of storm surge. That tends to <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/23850601/hurricane-idalia-florida-wind-forecast-storm-surge-flood-rapid-intensification">create more flooding</a> in the wake of a hurricane.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Helene appeared in one of the hottest years on record, with ocean temperatures near record highs and atmospheric conditions that scientists say are <a href="https://www.vox.com/climate/24145756/la-nina-2024-el-nino-heat-hurricane-record-temperature-pacific">suited for hurricane formation</a>. NOAA predicted that this year’s hurricane season would be <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season">above average</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Risks are only mounting for communities in the Southeast. According to the most recent <a href="https://nca2023.globalchange.gov/chapter/22/">National Climate Assessment</a>, a US government report, growing populations in regions hit by Helene, particularly in cities, has created new vulnerabilities to warming. “Over the last few decades, economic growth in the Southeast has been concentrated in and around urban centers that depend on climate-sensitive infrastructure and regional connections to thrive,” the report states.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">7) How can I help?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, check out <a href="https://x.com/klcpegher/status/1840431100851585076">local news outlets</a>, which have the most current information about what’s happening on the ground in places like Asheville. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Blue Ridge Public Radio has compiled <a href="https://www.bpr.org/bpr-news/2024-09-28/list-ways-to-donate-and-help-flood-victims-in-western-north-carolina-after-hurricane-helene">a list</a> of ways to help victims in western North Carolina. The <a href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/2024/09/29/how-to-help-hurricane-helene-flood-victims-in-tennessee/75443858007/">Knoxville News Sentinel</a> has a similar list for eastern Tennessee. FEMA also has <a href="https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20240928/how-help-after-hurricane-helene">links to state volunteer groups</a> assisting with the recovery.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some <a href="https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20240928/how-help-after-hurricane-helene">state emergency responders</a> have websites set up to collect donations for hurricane relief. Civic groups and food banks in affected communities are also collecting goods and money to help people who were hurt by the storm.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Local emergency managers are also providing guidance for what resources they do and don’t need. Please take this to heart. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency, for instance, specifically asks people not to self-deploy to disaster areas and to only donate things requested by local emergency coordinators. FEMA is also encouraging people in the region to <a href="https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20240928/how-help-after-hurricane-helene">coordinate with text messages</a> instead of phone calls to leave phone lines open and to donate cash instead of goods.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">Following President Joe Biden’s exit from the 2024 presidential race</a>, and his endorsement of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360327/vice-president-kamala-harris-joe-biden-nominee">Vice President Kamala Harris</a> as his choice for the Democratic nominee, one of the next big questions that’s emerged is who could potentially be her running mate. Though Harris is not the nominee yet, Biden’s backing gives her a significant boost ahead of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024">other potential contenders</a>, fueling speculation about who else could join the ticket.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, vice presidents have been selected to complement the main candidate. Biden chose Harris because she would bring youth, diversity, and legal experience. And former President Donald Trump chose Vice President Mike Pence because he was a traditional conservative and offered legislative expertise that he didn’t have. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What might Harris look for? Based on that history, there are a few guesses: Her pick could be someone from a purple or red state, who offers geographic diversity given her roots in California. And — to assuage voters who still hold sexist or racist attitudes, as President Barack Obama did with Biden in 2008 — it might be a white man.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Below is a rundown of some of the possible candidates who might be considered — and what they’d bring to the ticket. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2159037882_26f6dd.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov. Roy Cooper, in a navy suit, speaks from a podium to a large crowd holding Biden-Harris campaign signs." title="Gov. Roy Cooper, in a navy suit, speaks from a podium to a large crowd holding Biden-Harris campaign signs." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper speaks before President Joe Biden at a post-debate campaign rally on June 28, in Raleigh, North Carolina. | Allison Joyce/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Allison Joyce/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Roy Cooper</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Cooper, 67, is the governor of North Carolina, a battleground state that Trump won narrowly in 2020 and 2016 that offers <a href="https://www.ncsbe.gov/about-elections/electoral-college">16 electoral votes</a> (of the 270 needed to win). He’s known for winning repeatedly statewide even as other Democratic candidates have struggled to do the same for roles like the Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, he’s also vetoed Republican bills on abortion and guns, and has strong approval <a href="https://abc11.com/post/2024-elections-could-governor-roy-cooper-replace-president/15011995/">ratings overall</a>. Prior to becoming governor, he served as the state’s attorney general and in the state legislature.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Cooper could help improve Democrats’ chances in a battleground state, though it will still likely be an uphill battle given past contests in North Carolina. He’s also been pretty popular in his role, and has secured backing from some moderates and Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He previously collaborated with Harris while they each served as their states’ AG, meaning they have experience working alongside one another. And more recently, Harris and Cooper <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsVNTI1BqZo">have campaigned together</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357788/biden-trump-debate-winners-losers">Biden’s disastrous June debate</a>, during which the governor cautioned against the return of “Donald Trump’s America.”</p>

Josh Shapiro, in glasses and a navy suit jacket, waves at reporters and a crowd." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro arrives to deliver remarks at a building trades union conference on April 24, in Washington, DC. | Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Josh Shapiro</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Shapiro, 51, is the governor of Pennsylvania, another likely battleground state (with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">19 Electoral College votes</a>), which Biden won in 2020 and which former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton lost in 2016. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He was elected in 2022, the same year that freshman Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) was elected to the Senate. Shapiro ran far ahead of Fetterman, <a href="https://www.politico.com/2022-election/results/pennsylvania/">winning 57 percent of the vote, to Fetterman’s 51 percent</a>. Shapiro has established himself as a moderate who helped negotiate bipartisan deals when he was in the state legislature, and is also known for his work as attorney general, when he secured settlements for victims of sexual abuse by the Catholic Diocese. He’s also been a vocal supporter of Israel amid the country’s devastating military offensive in Gaza, following Hamas’ brutal October 7 attack. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him?</strong> Like Cooper, he’s the popular Democratic governor of a swing state and could help the party improve their chances there. He’s also seen as more of a centrist who could appeal to moderate voters and independents, though his staunch backing of Israel could turn away progressive Democrats.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/gettyimages-2161807297_5538e2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov.

Andy Beshear, in a light blue shirt and wearing a lapel mic, speaks to reporters while standing outdoors." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear speaks to reporters following a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Hazel, Kentucky, in October 2023. | Lexington Herald-Leader/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Lexington Herald-Leader/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Andy Beshear</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Beshear, 46, is the governor of Kentucky, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/11/7/23950792/election-day-2023-kentucky-governors-race-results-democrats-republicans">has won twice in a red state that previously overwhelmingly voted for Trump</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, he’s been praised for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic as well as multiple crises in the state, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/4/11/23679512/louisville-kentucky-shooting-workplace">a mass shooting at a bank</a> and severe flooding. Prior to this role, he also served as Kentucky’s attorney general.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Beshear is the rare Democrat who has been able to win multiple times in a red state, and could offer additional appeal to some swing voters. In addition to the support he’s received for his leadership during various crises, he’s also touted infrastructure and private sector investment in the state during his tenure.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Unlike other possibilities, though, he probably wouldn’t increase Harris’s chances of winning his home state, which is solidly GOP. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160763179.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov. J.B.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. J.B. Pritzker</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>J.B. Pritzker, 59, is the governor of Illinois, a Democratic state that Biden and Clinton both won in 2020 and 2016. Before becoming governor, he was a businessman and philanthropist, and is a scion of the family behind Hyatt hotels, who’ve also been consistent and influential Democratic donors.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor, Pritzker has established a modest national profile, including remarks he’s given attacking Trump and calls he’s made for more federal resources to address immigration in Illinois.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Pritzker has already built some name recognition as a fixture on cable news, and has proven to be a vocal Trump antagonist. Pritzker’s personal wealth could also potentially be a boon to the campaign, though his own state is not a battleground that would expand the Democratic map.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-2160744008_a0c39e.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Sen.

Mark Kelly, in a navy suit and blue-striped tie, wears a serious expression while speaking to a gaggle of reporters with microphones and smartphones. " data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) is questioned about the candidacy of President Joe Biden after a Senate luncheon on July 9. | Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Sen. Mark Kelly</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Kelly is the junior senator of Arizona — a swing state with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">11 Electoral College votes</a> — <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21537670/senate-2020-results-arizona-mark-kelly-winner">who was elected in 2020</a> by framing himself as a candidate willing to work across the aisle. Previously, Biden won Arizona in 2020, while Clinton lost the state in 2016. Kelly is also known for his career as an astronaut alongside his twin brother Scott Kelly, and as the husband of gun rights advocate and former US Rep. Gabby Giffords.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Kelly has a higher profile than some of the other names on this list, and is respected both for his scientific expertise and contributions as an astronaut in addition to his time in the Senate. He’s been a prominent gun control advocate alongside Giffords and made pushing these policies a priority.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given his efforts to appeal to both Republicans and independents in Arizona, he’d be another option who could help with trying to reach those voters. Arizona also continues to be an important battleground this time around, including in its <a href="https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">Senate race</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1247112367.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, in a snakeskin-patterned blouse, speaks into a set of microphones, smillng, with the state seal of Michigan behind her." title="Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, in a snakeskin-patterned blouse, speaks into a set of microphones, smillng, with the state seal of Michigan behind her." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer speaks at a press conference about an electric-vehicle battery plant in February 2023 in Romulus, Michigan. | Bill Pugliano/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Bill Pugliano/Getty Images" />
<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is she? </strong>Whitmer, 52, is the governor of Michigan, a key swing state with <a href="https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation">15 Electoral College votes</a> that Biden won in 2020 and that Clinton lost in 2016. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She’s been a popular leader in this role, and was initially known for how much she emphasized infrastructure and “fixing the damn roads.” Since then she’s been an outspoken advocate for abortion rights, and for gender equity, speaking openly about how she was sexually assaulted in college. Prior to being governor, Whitmer was a member of the state legislature and the first woman to become the Democratic leader of the state Senate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for her? </strong>She’s among the members of the list who have strong and positive national recognition, and who could help raise Democrats’ chances in a pivotal swing state. Whitmer has also focused on issues including infrastructure and health care, which could broaden Democrats’ appeal to moderate voters. And if Harris and Whitmer were on the same ticket, they would form a groundbreaking all-woman ticket — something that neither major party has run before. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/GettyImages-1394802139.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Pete Buttigieg, in a navy suit and white shirt, is shown from the side, while pinning an index card onto a wall full of similar cards with handwritten notes.

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Secretary Pete Buttigieg</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he?</strong> Buttigieg, 42, is the secretary of Transportation who rose to prominence as a former 2020 presidential candidate. He’s staked out more moderate positions, and was previously mayor of South Bend, Indiana. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He’s become known for his media savvy and strong television appearances as an advocate for the Biden-Harris administration. He’s also had to respond to crises including the train accident and <a href="https://www.vox.com/science/2023/2/18/23603471/east-palestine-ohio-derailment-water-contamination-health">chemical spill in East Palestine</a>, Ohio, as well as the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024/1/8/24030677/boeing-alaska-airlines-plane-737-max-door-plug">Alaska Airlines mishap</a> when a door plug dropped out of a plane. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Buttigieg has been a strong spokesperson for the Biden-Harris White House and is well-established among the Democratic electorate. He’s among the youngest of possible choices, would contribute more representation from the Midwest,<strong> </strong>and could appeal to centrist voters. He’d also become the first openly LGBTQ person to be on a presidential ticket.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Gov. Gavin Newsom</strong></h4>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Who is he? </strong>Newsom, 56, is the governor of California, and a longstanding political personality. He’s been a vocal advocate for more progressive policies, and for Democrats to more directly confront Republicans.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Prior to being governor, he was also lieutenant governor and mayor of San Francisco.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What’s the case for him? </strong>Newsom has already made clear that he wants to be a fighter for Democrats and has supporters who are interested in his approach. He’s also used opportunities like a debate against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to make some splashy points for the party and to get more attention, and could do the same for a possible campaign.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As governor of California, however, he wouldn’t bring additional geographic diversity to the ticket, and he also wouldn’t help with delivering a swing state, as his own is solidly Democratic.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Not long after President Joe Biden announced he was stepping aside from the presidential race Sunday, pro-Trump social media influencers had settled on one line of attack: that Democrats <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/politics/its-a-coup-maga-world-melts-down-over-biden-dropping-out-of-race/">had carried out a coup</a> against their own president.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden “has now been deposed in a coup,” Trump-backing venture capitalist <a href="https://x.com/DavidSacks/status/1815168526602387674">David Sacks wrote</a>. “Undermining Democracy should never be condoned,” <a href="https://twitter.com/RichardGrenell/status/1815090797668347944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1815090797668347944%7Ctwgr%5E13a36bbb3a548a03601a0d1dfabfab597f4072e8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fpolitics%2Fits-a-coup-maga-world-melts-down-over-biden-dropping-out-of-race%2F">Trump ally</a> Richard Grenell posted. “The coup is complete,” <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGosar/status/1815086422199767408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1815086422199767408%7Ctwgr%5E13a36bbb3a548a03601a0d1dfabfab597f4072e8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediaite.com%2Fpolitics%2Fits-a-coup-maga-world-melts-down-over-biden-dropping-out-of-race%2F">wrote</a> Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“What you just witnessed is proof positive that when the most powerful Democrat institutions and oligarchs unite to topple an American regime, they expect to succeed,” conservative activist <a href="https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1815091854351946189">Charlie Kirk wrote</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From people who support Donald Trump, the man who tried to steal the 2020 election, this is obviously a ridiculous and absurd thing to say. Yet it echoes a self-interested argument made by Biden himself just two weeks ago, when he argued that him dropping out would be tantamount to ignoring democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The voters — and the voters alone — decide the nominee of the Democratic Party,” Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359362/biden-dropout-2024-undemocratic-primaries-voters">wrote in a July 8 letter</a>. “Not the press, not the pundits, not the big donors, not any selected group of individuals, no matter how well intentioned.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s unfolded in the two weeks since has been a steadily intensifying pressure campaign from various members of the press, pundits, donors, and current and former elected officials aimed at making Biden quit. Some of these entreaties were made <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/nancy-pelosi-biden-conversation/index.html">in private</a> — and, when Biden didn’t appear to be listening, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/opinion/joe-biden-democratic-nominee.html">more</a> spilled <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/schumer-privately-urged-biden-step-aside-2024-election/story?id=112046011">out</a> into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/jamie-raskin-biden-letter.html">public</a> view. They argued that he couldn’t win and, eventually, he listened.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There may arguably be something a bit uncomfortable about the role of Democratic power brokers and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/biden-fundraising.html">donors</a> in pushing Biden aside after his primary win. But while they’re doing this without voters’ explicit say, they’re doing so in an attempt to (belatedly) respond to voters’ beliefs that Biden is too old to serve another term.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So it may be undemocratic in practice, but in a sense it’s democratic in intention. Because the party isn’t avoiding an election, they’re trying to win one, by picking a nominee who (they hope) can win more people’s votes.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How democratic were the 2024 Democratic primaries?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democratic Party elites didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree after the debate. Up until that disaster, they’d been fully behind Biden, and their support of him was one major reason Democratic voters were presented with no credible alternatives in this year’s primaries.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because in reality, Biden won the primaries well before the people got to vote. Back in 2022 and 2023, some polls <a href="https://apnews.com/article/ap-norc-poll-biden-2024-presidential-prospects-c843c5af6775b4c8a0cff8e2b1db03f6">showed</a> a majority of Democratic voters saying he shouldn’t run again. The president never seems to have seriously considered bowing out, though. He ran again and (as is normal for an incumbent) solidly locked down support from Democratic elites. As a result, Democratic rising stars were deterred from challenging Biden, believing they likely would have lost, and then been blamed if Trump won in the general. </p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, yes, 15 million people did indeed end up voting in those primaries. But how democratic was that process? Biden won the primaries because he won the inside game.&nbsp;It was party elites who determined the (few) options available to voters. Polls showed the voters would in theory have preferred someone else, but they weren’t offered a realistic opposing candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Furthermore, asserting that the primary result is all that matters, and that taking anything else into account is “undemocratic,” is a very limited and blinkered definition of democracy. After all, those 15 million people are a paltry sum compared to the 150 million people who may vote in the general election — people who, according to polls, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/01/us/politics/biden-age-democrats.html">overwhelmingly think</a> Biden is too old to serve another term. Many of those people wanted another candidate — shouldn’t their views matter?</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The “new information after the primaries” problem</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another issue is that primary voters did not have the information that Biden would perform so poorly in the debate when they cast their votes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And though what key Democratic Party figures just did to Biden is in some ways unprecedented, in other ways it’s very familiar. That is: it’s the standard playbook for how to force out a suddenly scandal-plagued elected official who is believed to be hurting the party.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This playbook involves a ratcheting up of pressure and condemnations as co-partisans gradually condemn or abandon that official, making sure they know that the battering will continue unless they quit — basically what we’ve seen over the past few weeks.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">New York Democrats successfully employed it against <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/5/22607971/cuomo-impeachment-resignation-scandal">Gov. Andrew Cuomo</a> in 2021, Attorney General <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/four-women-accuse-new-yorks-attorney-general-of-physical-abuse">Eric Schneiderman</a> in 2018, and Gov. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2008/03/12/88134976/spitzer-resigns-after-sex-scandal-pressure">Eliot Spitzer</a> in 2008. Senate Democrats did it against <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/07/franken-resigns-285957">Sen. Al Franken</a> (D-MN) in 2017. (Though it doesn’t always work, as shown in the cases of Virginia Gov. <a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/2/15/18224864/ralph-northam-virginia-blackface-apology-protests">Ralph Northam</a>, and 2016 GOP presidential nominee <a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/10/08/donald-trump-debate-mike-crapo-mike-lee-barbara-comstock/91784714/">Donald Trump</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Your mileage may vary in how much you view Biden’s bad debate performance as a full-on scandal. But it was certainly new information that wasn’t clear during the primaries. Back then, Biden refused to participate in any debates and skipped some high-profile interview opportunities, leaving it ambiguous how he might perform in a high-stakes setting.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the truth is that party elites didn’t just casually abandon the choice of the voters right after they made that choice. They defected later, because of new information — information that those primary voters did not have.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Party loyalty is a two-way street</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, it is also worth noting that party elites didn’t push Biden off the ticket in an effort to steal the power of the presidency from him. They abandoned him because they fear he is hurting the party’s electoral chances — that is, because he’s lost support from voters.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Party loyalty is a two-way street — it is not, or at least should not be, a blood oath or a cult of personality. Leading Democrats backed Biden when they thought he could win, and they ditched him when they thought he couldn’t.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, they’re trying to substitute a nominee they hope the American public will like a lot better. And there’s something very democratic about that. They are (finally, belatedly) trying to listen to the voters, who, according to polls at least, keep saying they don’t want to support Biden again.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So maybe it would have been nice if Democrats had had an actual presidential primary process rather than this mess. But that didn’t happen — and, considering the options, party officials abandoning Biden to try and nudge him aside in favor of someone who can win was a reasonable response.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">dropping out of the 2024 race</a>, President Joe Biden did what we all want our politicians to do: He put his country over his career. Knowing that his party had lost faith in his capacity to beat Donald Trump and that a second Trump term <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/5/13/23708595/trump-second-term-cnn-town-hall">would threaten democracy itself</a>, he chose to do the right thing and step aside.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, it took him a long time to get here. While it’s only been 24 days since the disastrous debate with Trump, we don’t know how long Biden had been in decline prior to that. The earlier that clock starts, the worse it reflects on Biden and his team.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But ultimately, the story isn’t really about Joe Biden as a person. It’s about what he and his party did — and what their actions tell us about the state of American democracy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And what they say is surprisingly hopeful.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In a country where many think politicians won’t do the right thing, Biden did (even if he exhausted all other options first). In a country where political parties seem to cower in the face of their own leaders, one party managed to challenge and push out a candidate whose campaign served neither party nor country. And in a country where polarization seemingly ground everything to a standstill, democracy showed it’s still capable of surprising us.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden’s announcement, and the Democratic effort to push him into it, shows America’s institutions might not be as broken as many think. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden (ultimately) does the right thing</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For years, voters have been telling pollsters that they thought Joe Biden was too old to serve a second term as president. The race remained competitive because voters were similarly wary of Trump, but there was clear unease about Biden’s future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden could have chosen to listen to those fears. He could have stepped aside before the primary elections, or encouraged an open convention back when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html">the New York Times’s Ezra Klein sounded the alarm bell about age in February</a>. But he didn’t.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then the disastrous June debate happened, and the chorus became deafening. <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/biden-trump-2024-polls-drop-out-rcna161348">Poll after poll</a> found that large majorities of Americans&nbsp;—&nbsp;and even <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/07/11/poll-biden-drop-out-election/">majorities of <em>Democrats</em></a> — had concluded that Biden wasn’t competent to serve a second term. (This speaks to the absurdity of the narrative, popular among some Biden dead-enders and bad faith right-wingers, that the push against Biden is <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerJohnson/status/1815093011669516433">undemocratic</a> or <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-biden-step-down-kamala-harris-chuck-schumer-hakeem-jeffries-donald-trump-363a0701">even a kind of coup</a>.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden was not just heading for defeat. He and his party were confirming nearly every negative stereotype the voters had about the political system: Politicians were selfish, aged fools unable to act in the public interest; political parties were creatures of a corrupt elite entirely out of touch with the public.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In stepping aside, Biden flips the script. He showed that, when push really came to shove, there was something more important to the president than power: the fortunes of the party and the fate of his country. Even if the actual sequence of events followed <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/10/28/241295755/a-churchill-quote-that-u-s-politicians-will-never-surrender">the apocryphal quip</a> that “Americans will always do the right thing, only after they have tried everything else,” he did, ultimately, come to the right conclusion.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s enough to make even the most jaded observer a little more optimistic about American democracy — for at least two big reasons.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, it shows that there can still be standards in politics.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">American politics isn’t just made up of two parties, wholly owned by party elites, locked in a mortal and uncompromising struggle to the death. At least one of our parties is capable of policing its own: challenging an incumbent president and, ultimately, convincing him to step aside. The contrast with the GOP’s behavior after Trump’s many scandals — from the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/nyregion/access-hollywood-tape-trump-trial.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/28/nyregion/access-hollywood-tape-trump-trial.html">Access Hollywood tape</a> to the January 6 Capitol riot —&nbsp;is unmistakable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, Biden’s departure shows that unexpected things can still happen.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is hard to prove, but I think so much of the polling showing public distrust in the American government is rooted in a sense that it’s stuck: that what’s happening right now isn’t working, and that no one is capable of doing anything surprising to right the ship. But a president abandoning a reelection campaign is nothing if not surprising.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Politicians like Trump, in both the United States and elsewhere, thrive on the notion that the system is broken and nothing can be done to fix it. This is a problem not just because those specific politicians are dangerous, but because distrust rots democracy’s foundations.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By showing that the system doesn’t only throw up unappealing options — that politics can be more than just a contest between two unpopular older men —&nbsp;Biden and the Democrats just did real work at repairing those foundations. They showed that a central promise of democracy, that it can self-correct after even grievous errors, remains intact.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Fully repairing American democracy will take a lot more work than this, of course. The problems run much deeper than the 2020 election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this is a big step in the right direction. And as a result, I’m feeling something that might seem unusual in the oft-gloomy world of American politics: hope.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">announced</a> Sunday that he is dropping out of the 2024 presidential race and <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933">endorsed</a> Vice President Kamala Harris as his choice for the Democratic nominee. A practical question follows: What happens to his campaign funds?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Biden campaign said it had <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-biden-fundraising-democrats-8492425af85796ad77844b77db6d0f30">$240 million in cash on hand</a> earlier this month, compared to former President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-biden-fundraising-democrats-8492425af85796ad77844b77db6d0f30">$331 million</a>. Campaign finance rules put some limits on what Biden can do with that money now that he’s no longer running for president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The money isn’t just in limbo, however. Though it’s not yet completely certain whether Harris will become the nominee — she’d need Biden’s delegates at the Democratic National Convention to assume the candidacy, though his endorsement certainly <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024">puts her ahead of any possible competition</a> —&nbsp;she could access Biden’s funds more easily than another Democrat. And the campaign pot only seems to be growing: Major Democratic donors, some of whom had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/12/briefing/biden-donor-pressure-trump-vice-president.html">paused their contributions</a> after Biden’s disastrous debate performance last month due to concerns about his candidacy, reportedly reopened their wallets after Biden’s announcement Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden and Harris already share funds in a campaign committee under campaign finance laws that allow the president and vice president to run together as one ticket, said Saurav Ghosh, the Campaign Legal Center’s director of federal campaign finance reform. If she were to remain on the ticket as the presidential nominee, “the new ticket would maintain access to all the funds in the campaign committee,” Ghosh added.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That would make Harris’s transition to the top of the ticket seamless — at least when it comes to the money.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>What happens to Biden’s campaign funds if Harris isn’t the nominee?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While it currently seems that Harris has a decent chance of being Democrats’ choice for president, not everyone is on board. Some lawmakers have appeared to back an open process of some sort to select the new Democratic nominee, including <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/19/pelosi-support-open-nomination-biden-drop-out-00169893">former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi</a> and <a href="https://barackobama.medium.com/my-statement-on-president-bidens-announcement-1eb78b3ba3fc">former President Barack Obama</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It would be difficult for another Democrat to challenge Harris, given that she now has Biden’s endorsement and the support of millions of Americans who already voted for the Biden-Harris ticket. So even if there is an open process either at the Democratic Convention or before it, Harris would have a good shot at winning the nomination.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But if she doesn’t and drops off the ticket entirely, she and Biden couldn’t just transfer their millions to another Democrat. Campaign finance laws impose a limit of only $2,000 per election for transfers from one candidate to another. There are a few potential workarounds, but it is unlikely that any would allow the new candidate to take full advantage of the value of Biden’s campaign coffers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For one, Biden could “offer to refund the money to donors who could then contribute to the new candidate’s campaign,” Ghosh said. But this is an unreliable method: Refunding the money to donors is no guarantee that they will contribute to the Democratic ticket again and relies on them to do the legwork. </p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alternatively, Biden could transfer all his funds to the Democratic National Committee. As much as <a href="https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/making-disbursements-political-party/coordinated-party-expenditures/coordinated-party-expenditure-limits/#:~:text=As%20detailed%20in%20the%20tables,archived%20limits%20from%20past%20years.&amp;text=For%20House%20nominees%20in%20all%20other%20states%2C%20the%20limit%20is%20%2461%2C800.">$32.3 million of that</a> could be spent in coordination with the nominee, and the DNC could also unilaterally spend the rest of the money to support the new nominee, Ghosh said. That’s in addition to the approximately <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00010603/">$65 million in cash</a> the DNC had on hand by the end of May. But that approach has a drawback: The DNC might not necessarily target its investments in the way the campaign would prefer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Biden could also potentially <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-biden-fundraising-democrats-8492425af85796ad77844b77db6d0f30">transfer his funds</a> to an independent super PAC if Harris is not on the ticket. But super PACs cannot coordinate with campaigns, and they are typically <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-biden-fundraising-election-campaign-donations-5709f07420b4f138caa884361653368e">charged more to take out ads</a> than campaigns. That means that the money wouldn’t go as far.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Those are the campaign’s best options. Now, campaign finance rules aren’t likely to be the only determining factor in who ultimately succeeds Biden. But those rules do make Harris the most practical choice (at least from a campaign finance perspective) with months to go before the November election.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Does PAC money automatically go to Harris? What about other funding streams?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to the funds in his campaign coffers, Biden has also <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/09/240-million-who-gets-joe-bidens-campaign-money/74295593007/">relied on several joint fundraising committees</a>, essentially groups that fundraise across allied political organizations, including the Biden Victory Fund, which had about <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/jfc/summary.php?id=C00744946&amp;cycle=2024">$40 million on hand</a> as of the end of June.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These committees have signed agreements with Biden’s campaign fund indicating how the funds they raise together at joint fundraisers will be allocated. So long as all of them agree, those agreements can be changed so that they can support the new nominee.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are also several <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/2024-presidential-race/joe-biden/candidate?id=N00001669">major super PACs</a> currently supporting Biden, including <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00669259/">Future Forward</a>, which had about $92 million in cash on hand at the end of May. But since super PACs are independent of campaigns, they can change how their funds are allocated at any point.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">After weeks of pressure, conjecture, and handwringing at the highest levels of the Democratic Party, President Joe Biden has decided to step aside from the 2024 presidential race.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The president issued a <a href="https://x.com/joebiden/status/1815080881981190320?s=46&amp;t=WDV3NvpmCLI-fO5R13Teug">written statement Sunday afternoon</a>, saying he believes it is in the country’s best interest for him to step down, adding that he will address the nation later in the week about his decision. Biden’s decision comes after weeks of public and private <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361597/biden-drop-out-democrats-obama-pelosi-schumer">entreaties from Democrats</a> who have concluded that he is unlikely to defeat former President Donald Trump.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Moments later, Biden released <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933">another statement endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris</a> to take his spot atop the ticket. Some other leading Democrats — <a href="https://x.com/BillClinton/status/1815102085198958657">Bill and Hillary Clinton</a>, the <a href="https://twitter.com/errinhaines/status/1815104279138509105" data-type="link" data-id="https://twitter.com/errinhaines/status/1815104279138509105">Congressional Black Caucus</a>, Sens. <a href="https://twitter.com/timkaine/status/1815103608419143947/history">Tim Kaine </a>(D-VA) and <a href="https://twitter.com/maxpcohen/status/1815102726826840560">Tammy Baldwin</a> (D-WI) — quickly endorsed Harris, too, revealing a desire in the party to quickly unite behind her.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Such endorsements do not make Harris the presidential nominee — the new nominee will be officially chosen by the thousands of delegates attending the Democratic National Convention beginning August 19. But if such endorsements keep piling up, they may deter any other prominent Democrats from challenging Harris and make her nomination all-but-assured.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Alternatively, other Democrats could put their names in contention. What would happen after that is unclear. Some in the party have spoken of a “<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/07/20/2024/democrats-detail-blitz-primary-options-to-replace-biden">blitz primary</a>” or a truly “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-elaine-kamarck.html">open convention</a>” where delegates are freed up to support whomever they like. Others view this as chaotic folly. Whether this is at all likely will first depend on whether anyone else jumps in, though.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What is clear is that the presidential contest is entering uncharted territory for the modern era. Since the rise of the modern nomination process in the 1970s, no winner of the primaries has quit the race before the convention. And no major-party nominee has entered the race so close to November.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s worth pausing to appreciate just what a dramatic turn of events this has been. It was just a few short months ago that President Biden <a href="https://6abc.com/2024-super-tuesday-states-primary-results/14492343/">sailed through</a> the primary season with barely any opposition. But now, his party support has collapsed under him to the point where he effectively can’t continue his campaign.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race. Catch up on this story.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">President Joe Biden surrendered to pressure from top Democrats and campaign donors who urged him to step aside amid concerns over his age and low polling numbers against Donald Trump.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The catalyst for this collapse was Biden’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/358652/biden-drop-out-debate-harris-convention">June 27 debate performance</a>, which will surely now go down as the most catastrophic general election debate in US presidential history. But what the debate actually did was supercharge concerns about Biden’s electoral prospects, stamina, health, and capacity that have long simmered below the surface of Democratic politics.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The doubts about Biden did not begin with the debate, but the debate suddenly made them impossible to ignore — and spurred the party to take action.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What will happen next, though, is far from clear. Some Democrats profess to believe that Biden was a uniquely flawed nominee because of his age, and that a different nominee could perform much better against the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/favorability/donald-trump/">unpopular Trump</a>. But others are more pessimistic, suspecting that the party faces deeper electoral problems and that any replacement nominee is going to have a very tough road ahead.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Biden plowed ahead with his campaign despite party doubts. The debate made those doubts impossible to ignore.</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the start of Biden’s first term, many in the political world questioned whether he would run for a second term, for two reasons: One is his age, since he’s already the oldest US president ever and would be 82 by Inauguration Day. The other is his bad polling numbers; his job approval has been dismal <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">since late 2021</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But Biden doesn’t ever appear to have seriously considered not running. He said <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/biden-reelection-2024/2021/11/20/0779469c-4947-11ec-95dc-5f2a96e00fa3_story.html">from the start</a> of his term that he intended to run again, and when Democrats’ midterm election performance was better than many expected, it seemed to bolster his case that he could. So he made his reelection campaign official <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/25/1145679856/biden-president-announcement-2024-running-reelection">in April 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All the party’s rising stars opted against launching a risky primary challenge to an incumbent president — doing otherwise would have earned them intense criticism in the party for dividing Democrats and damaging Biden’s chances in the general election. So Biden easily fended off challenges from the likes of Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) and author Marianne Williamson.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But doubts remained. Biden skeptics raised eyebrows at his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/06/media/biden-skipping-super-bowl-interview/index.html">skipping the president’s</a> traditional pre-Super Bowl interview, at his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/21/us/politics/biden-public-appearances-media.html">reluctance</a> to do press conferences, and at a special counsel report’s claims that he <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2024/2/8/24066529/biden-special-counsel-report-memory">seemed to have</a> a poor memory. In February, New York Times columnist (and Vox co-founder) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/opinion/ezra-klein-biden-audio-essay.html">Ezra Klein caused a stir</a> by writing that Democrats should choose a different nominee at the convention, because Biden did not seem up for the rigors of the campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, Biden gave a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/07/biden-state-of-the-union-2024/">reasonably spirited performance</a> at his State of the Union address in March, temporarily putting those concerns to rest. But it did not improve his polls — by then, he’d consistently trailed Trump nationally and in almost every swing state <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-biden">for months</a>. He looked on track for defeat.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/15/us/politics/trump-biden-debate-june.html">reportedly why</a> Biden’s team made the surprising proposal to debate Trump so early, a very unusual move. The hope was that Biden could, with a vigorous performance, reset the race, refocus attention on Trump, and address concerns about his age again.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The opposite happened: Biden’s halting performance put a spotlight on his capacity to campaign (and serve another four years) that never went away.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">He lost the media first.&nbsp;In the hours after the debate, <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357746/biden-trump-debate-democrats-replace-dnc">various</a> liberal <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/25/opinion/joe-biden-drop-out.html">commentators</a> called on him <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/opinion/joe-biden-tom-friedman.html">to quit</a> the race. Mainstream journalists, sensing scandal and a cover-up, intensely focused on reporting out <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/359024/biden-age-leaks-lapses-polls">Biden’s true condition</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Biden hoped that he could keep the party on board by doing a flurry of interviews and public events, showing the debate was a one-off. Some of these went <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360124/biden-dropout-defections-obama-pelosi">reasonably well</a>, others <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/17/politics/video/biden-youtube-complex-interview-tapper-lead-digvid">less so</a>. But his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/18/us/politics/biden-fundraising.html">fundraising plummeted</a>, and the public and private pressure from Democrats urging him to step aside <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/19/us/politics/biden-democrats-campaign.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">just kept increasing</a> — until Biden finally saw the writing on the wall.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The big question going forward: Are Democrats’ electoral problems just about Biden?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what happens next?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Obviously, much will depend on who the nominee is. Clearly, Vice President Harris is the top contender at the moment. If the party simply falls in line behind her, there may not be much suspense by the time the Democratic convention kicks off on August 19. If there is a serious contest, though, strap in for a roller coaster ride over the next month.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s another big underlying question that we don’t yet know the answer to. Namely, how much are Democrats’ electoral woes about Joe Biden himself — and how much reflect deeper problems for the party as a whole?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some argue that Democrats are doing fine, and that it’s only Biden that’s been the problem; that voters have soured on the president because of his age or perceived incapacity to serve another four years, and because Trump remains flawed and unpopular, and another Democratic nominee would likely beat him. For instance, Democratic Senate incumbents <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/briefing/biden-vs-the-democratic-party.html">are polling significantly better</a> than Biden. That implies to some that with a different name at the top of the ticket, the party would be in great shape.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Others argue that Democrats’ problems will likely outlast Biden. Unhappiness with inflation under Biden, as well as unfolding foreign tumult<strong>,</strong> may have convinced voters that Trump wasn’t so bad after all. Public opinion on <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2024/07/the-changes-in-vibes-why-did-they-happen.html">key issues</a> has moved right. And there <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-whitmer">isn’t</a> much <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-newsom">polling</a> showing any possible Democratic <a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/president/general/2024/trump-vs-harris">alternative</a> beating Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some of these pessimists still believe it was worth pushing out Biden since he had little prospect of turning things around, but they emphasize that any replacement would be the underdog and face a very tough road ahead.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All we know for sure now is that Democrats have decided to roll the dice, ditching their unpopular nominee in hopes of improving their odds in a contest they were on track to lose.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s official: President Joe Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor after announcing Sunday afternoon that he’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/politics/361827/biden-drops-out-2024-kamala-convention">decided not to run again this year</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats — it’s time to come together and beat Trump. Let’s do this,” Biden wrote in a post on X, <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933" data-type="link" data-id="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933">formerly known as Twitter.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That endorsement puts Harris in a prime position to assume her party’s presidential nomination ahead of a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024">wide field of other potential choices</a>, including<strong> </strong>Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though Democrats have a deep bench of talent, perhaps no one makes as much sense to replace Biden as Harris, who’s already in a role designed to take over for a president unable to continue their duties — and who now has his backing.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As VP, she’s steeped in the policy work of this administration, and has extensive experience in the White House that she could bring to the job. And she could well be an energizing candidate for many Democratic voters as the first Black and South Asian woman to have the party’s presidential nomination, and as a younger, charismatic alternative to the 78-year-old Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump. Logistically, it would also be fairly easy to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-biden-fundraising-election-campaign-donations-5709f07420b4f138caa884361653368e#">transfer Biden’s $91 million in campaign funds to Harris</a> (and more difficult to hand that money over to someone else).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, Harris has real vulnerabilities — which have been evident during her tenure as VP and as a 2020 presidential candidate — that could potentially bog her down in the general election. Notably, <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article289792134.html">her favorability ratings have sometimes lagged Biden’s</a> while she’s been vice president, and a common critique she faces is that she hasn’t been able to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html">carve out a distinct lane for herself</a>. When she ran for the presidency in 2020, she fielded similar issues, leaving people confused about what she stood for.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taken together, there’s plenty of evidence that Harris could be a strong nominee. Notably, though, there are also some key challenges she’ll have to overcome.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>The case for Kamala Harris taking over for Biden</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As the Democratic nominee, Harris would have some version of the incumbency advantage as the sitting vice president. Though there are important caveats, as detailed by <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/23562688/joe-biden-2024-presidential-election-polls-democrats">my colleague Andrew Prokop</a>, roughly two of three incumbents have won reelection.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As part of that advantage, Harris would be able to tout her role in the Biden administration’s wins — like the Inflation Reduction Act, which will help lower prescription drug costs and invest in climate initiatives, and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes historic funding for bridges and roads. She’d be able to point, too, to the experience she’s garnered as vice president and how it’s prepared her to become commander-in-chief.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s a strategy Biden himself successfully employed in 2020, when he <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/9/16/20863343/joe-biden-barack-obama-2020-democratic-presidential-primary">linked himself to the Obama administration’s achievements</a> — and emphasized how <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2012/04/26/remarks-vice-president-joe-biden-foreign-policy-camapaign-event">he was often the “last one in the room”</a> when key decisions were being made.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“When you think about all these legislative pieces that were passed in Congress, the vice president was part of the conversations with the president, with the Cabinet, whether it was the infrastructure bill, or the IRA, or the CHIPS bill,” <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/27/23655248/kamala-harris-vice-president-approval-criticism">former Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, who’s worked alongside Harris, previously told Vox</a>. That experience, in itself, is significant and invaluable.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her</strong></strong>.</h2>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since the fall of <em>Roe, </em>Harris has also taken on the mantle of abortion rights, meeting with advocates and voters across the country, and rallying people on the issue in places like Wisconsin, Arizona, and Florida.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This subject has been particularly motivating for Democratic voters and women in recent elections, with multiple ballot initiatives — like <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/23451074/abortion-ballot-measure-midterms-kentucky-montana-michigan">those in Vermont and Michigan</a> — passing with overwhelming support. During the 2022 midterm elections, protecting reproductive rights was a central policy for many voters, and a decisive one that helped boost Democrats. Harris’s defense of abortion access is a point that would allow her to paint a sharp contrast with Trump, who has taken credit for <em>Roe</em>’s demise and argued that abortion should be decided on a state-by-state basis.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In addition to the experience she has in the White House, Harris also brings legislative expertise from her four years in the Senate, and background on criminal justice reform from her time as attorney general in California. Although some of her tenure as vice president has been plagued with communications missteps, she’d previously been known for her viral moments questioning Trump appointees as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and made a big splash in 2019 during a debate confrontation of Biden over his past stance on busing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris could infuse the ticket with new energy as well. Numerous polls have found that majorities of Americans didn&#8217;t want Biden on the ballot, including a <a href="https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/contest-for-president-still-up-for-grabs/">July 2024 PBS News/NPR/Marist</a> survey placing that number at 56 percent, and wanted to see <a href="https://wapo.st/469LlsL">options other than Biden or Trump</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris is well-positioned to be that alternative. At 59, she’s decades younger than both the current nominees. And she’s also emblematic of both an increasingly diverse Democratic Party and country, making her a candidate who could be especially motivating for key voting constituencies including Black women. (<a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/kamala-harris-favorability">In a July 2024 YouGov poll,</a> Harris’s favorability numbers were at 41 percent with adults overall, and 69 percent among Black respondents.) That could bode well for better turnout and enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“She’s the second Black woman elected to the Senate, which in a state like California is no small feat,” says University of Maryland public policy professor <a href="https://spp.umd.edu/our-community/faculty-staff/niambi-carter">Niambi Carter</a>. “So she’s shown that she can get voters, white, Black, Latino, and others, to come to the polls.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Experts note, too, that bypassing Harris for another candidate — especially a white one — could run the risk of fracturing support from Black voters and other key Democratic constituencies, says <a href="https://split-ticket.org/author/lakshyajain97/">Lakshya Jain</a>, the CEO of electoral analysis site Split Ticket.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think there would be significant voter backlash,” Jain told Vox. “It would rupture the party and create negative news cycles for quite a while, and the eventual nominee would emerge quite wounded and with a massive amount of ground to make up among Black voters.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Finally, on the logistics front, Harris would be able to make the transition more seamlessly because she could inherit Biden’s fundraising apparatus and campaign staff, as former White House press secretary <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTNUhvweM/">Jen Psaki explained in a TikTok post</a>. “Structurally, she could just move the campaign staff, she could move all their resources over,” Psaki noted.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Harris</strong>’s vulnerabilities, briefly explained</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For all the strengths she’d bring as a nominee, there have also been issues Harris has struggled with as vice president, and as a presidential candidate in 2020. And those could haunt her should she be Democrats’ 2024 pick.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Notably, while she’s remained liked by a number of Democratic constituencies, her overall favorability and approval numbers haven’t been the strongest. As a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">FiveThirtyEight aggregation</a> found, Biden has 37 percent approval from all US voters, while Harris has <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">38 percent</a>. And she’d be seen as a continuation of the Biden administration, meaning she could be simply viewed as “more of the same” by voters who aren’t happy with the policies or positions it’s represented. Per surveys from this past year, voters are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/podcasts/the-daily/trump-biden-poll.html">interested in change</a> and have expressed discontent with the status quo.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris also hasn’t always defined herself — and what she stands for — that clearly.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2020, that was evident in how she sought to adopt both progressive and moderate policy stances, seemingly losing members of both constituencies. She’s especially struggled with the left and its often younger voters: Despite her self-described position as a progressive prosecutor, she was called out by grassroots progressives  during the 2019 campaign for actions she’d taken on truancy as well as wrongful convictions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This same overarching issue has emerged in her vice presidency, when some critics have argued that she hasn’t established what issues she owns or been clear about what she’s been able to achieve.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">White House officials have previously highlighted her extensive work on foreign policy, immigration, voting rights, and reproductive rights. That’s a broad portfolio, and staffers who’ve worked with her have described the catch-22 that it can feel like Harris faces: if she chose solely to work on one issue, for example, she risks getting pigeonholed. If she works more broadly, as she has opted to do, she’s criticized for not being dedicated to just one area.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And while she’s been an effective communicator in a number of high-profile cases ranging from her questioning of former Trump Attorney General Jeff Sessions to a major speech she gave on the 50th anniversary of <em>Roe</em>, she’s also been pilloried for statements that have been commonly derided as sounding like “<a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/20/news/kamala-harris-serves-up-another-word-salad-as-discusses-most-election-of-our-lifetime/">word salad</a>.” Those remarks have prompted some to wonder if she’d be able to be a strong enough messenger for Democrats during this pivotal time.&nbsp;(Others online have embraced some of these remarks including, famously, by making <a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive">memes about her coconut tree and venn diagram</a> comments.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her record with staff has been scrutinized by reporters, too, due to the turnover that’s taken place in her office across the roles she’s held, raising questions about her management style. Stories emerged about her <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-staffers-toxic-office-culture-dysfunction-2021-7">attorney general</a> office and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/30/kamala-harris-office-dissent-497290">her VP office</a> detailing what some staffers describe as a difficult work environment that stemmed from the top. Such reports fuel concerns about what leadership would look like in a Harris White House, though her office is far from the only one to have <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tracking-turnover-in-the-biden-administration/#:~:text=President%20Biden's%20%E2%80%9CA%2DTeam%E2%80%9D,Biden's%20Cabinet%20turnover%20is%2013%25.">seen turnover</a> in these roles.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And latent sexism and racism among voters is a key worry some Democrats have raised. “I don&#8217;t know that a lot of people want to admit this, [but] I think there are a lot of people who are uncomfortable with a Black woman being the president,” says Carter. Candidates of color and women, including former President Barack Obama, have long had to navigate such biases &#8212; <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna24284188" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna24284188">and electability concerns</a> &#8212; though he was ultimately able to win in spite of them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, these dynamics indicate that a Harris nomination, like any other, would come with both pros and cons. In the difficult situation that Democrats find themselves in, Harris’s strengths could well outweigh her vulnerabilities — if she can address them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Presidential candidates, and their campaigns, are the sum of all in which they exist and what came before them.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Just after he announced he was withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race, President Joe Biden <a href="https://x.com/JoeBiden/status/1815087772216303933">endorsed</a> his vice president, Kamala Harris, as the nominee in his place — giving her a huge leg up in whatever process could follow from here. But there are still many unknowns about the future of the Democratic ticket. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Over the past weeks, amid speculation about Biden&#8217;s future on the ticket, two debates have played out. The first big question is whether Harris will be President Joe Biden’s replacement, or if <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/357936/biden-harris-buttigieg-newsom-whitmer-pritzker-convetion-debate-2024">another Democratic politician</a>, like Govs. Gretchen Whitmer (MI), Josh Shapiro (PA), or Gavin Newsom (CA) would do better. The <em>other</em> question circulating among pundits, pollsters, journalists, strategists, and regular folks is whether Harris would be a stronger presidential contender than Biden.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We can answer this question in a few ways: looking at data on her prospects, her recent performance on the campaign trail, and her past candidacies. Each of these paths give us limited answers, but to borrow a phrase from former Defense Secretary <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/rumsfeld-dead-words-known-unknowns/2021/07/01/831175c2-d9df-11eb-bb9e-70fda8c37057_story.html">Donald Rumsfeld</a>, we can still identify a few “known unknowns” that make the future a bit more divinable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive">Coconut-pilled</a> backers of a Kamala Harris presidential campaign argue that Harris runs about even or even better than Biden does against former President Donald Trump <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/">in polling</a>; they point to Harris’s performance on the campaign trail so far, making the case against Trump and the American right’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360318/project-2025-trump-policies-abortion-divorce">plans in Project 2025</a>; and at a base level, they argue that she has been tested on the national stage, while other alternative candidates have not.</p>

<div class="wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight">
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>President Joe Biden endorsed Kamala Harris for president. Here’s what to know about her.</strong></h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">Vice President Kamala Harris could replace Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket in 2024.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Critics of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/7/25/20697783/khive-twitter-kamala-harris-2020-candidate-doug-hive">KHive</a> — as the online superfans of the vice president call themselves — and the VP argue that Harris is still really unpopular with the American public. They argue that the polls don’t actually show that much of an advantage for Harris in battleground states or with the popular vote; they point to her failed 2019 presidential campaign and her tepid vice presidential tenure as proof she’s not a particularly good candidate or politician and would likely run an uneven campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">They also argue that Biden’s flaws and foibles are already built into the electorate’s mind, while the chaos and uncertainty of swapping in Harris would expose the Democrats to even more risks (like how voters react to a woman of color as a nominee).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The debate was the roiling undercurrent of the will-he-or-won’t-he <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361597/biden-drop-out-democrats-obama-pelosi-schumer">drama over Biden</a> these last few weeks. How it resolves now that he is off the ticket could have enduring ramifications for both the Democratic Party and the country.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The upsides to swapping in Harris</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris backers have plenty to point to in the aftermath of June’s presidential debate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s the obvious stuff: Harris is younger, can actually string sentences together, and has already been campaigning against Trump this year. These points were once again demonstrated this week —&nbsp;while Biden was forced to recover from Covid at his home in Delaware during the week of the Republican National Convention, Harris was on the trail with North Carolina Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What the data says: </strong>First, a caveat: comparing polling of reality to a hypothetical match-up is always a bit treacherous.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What we can say from head-to-head polling of Harris is that the general trend has gotten a lot better for her. A year ago <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/358559/biden-harris-whitmer-newsom-shapiro-buttigieg-alternative-nomination-candidate-2024">she was underperforming Biden in head-to-head polling against Trump</a> in a variety of surveys. Closer to the debate and right after, she began to perform about evenly. And more recently, in July, a few polls comparing Biden and Harris against Trump in battleground states and nationally have shown Harris even with Biden or slightly ahead of him.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first sign of this change came from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/02/politics/cnn-poll-post-debate/index.html">CNN’s first post-debate poll</a>, finding the vice president trailing Trump by 2 percentage points (within the margin of error) while Biden trailed by 6 points. And in <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/538/kamala-harris-stronger-candidate-biden/story?id=111656941">FiveThirtyEight’s</a> polls-only post-debate comparison of Harris and Biden vs. Trump, Harris performs slightly better than the president in battleground states <em>— </em>though not in all of them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recent polling from Pennsylvania and Virginia also shows more positive signs for the vice president: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/15/us/politics/pennsylvania-virginia-polls-biden-trump.html">New York Times/Siena College</a> polls this month show that while Harris still trails Trump by 1 point in Pennsylvania, that’s a smaller gap than the 3 points that put Trump ahead of Biden there. Both of these results are within the polling’s margin of error, making the race in the state essentially tied. In Virginia, meanwhile, Harris’s lead over Trump is 2 points larger than the lead Biden has over the former president.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And a post-assassination attempt <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/race-presidency-remains-unchanged-wake-assassination-attempt-trump">national poll from Reuters/Ipsos</a> shows a statistically tied presidential contest for either Biden or Harris against Trump.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Under the hood, however, Harris backers can find an additional data point in their column: <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2024-07/Reuters%20Ipsos%20Post%20Trump%20Assasionation%20Attempt%20Poll%20Topline.pdf">69 percent of respondents think Biden is too old</a>; Harris doesn’t face that concern. And Biden is more unpopular than Harris, something that is consistently true: As of July 18, Biden has a net -17.7 <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">approval</a> rating in the FiveThirtyEight aggregate. Harris’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/approval/kamala-harris/">disapproval</a> is at 11.8. And in RealClearPolitics’ average of favorability ratings, Biden (<a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/favorability/joe-biden">-16.3</a>) is also more unpopular than Harris (<a href="https://www.realclearpolling.com/polls/favorability/kamala-harris">-14.9</a>)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What the campaign trail shows: </strong>Harris backers can point to the vice president’s performance on the road this year and argue that she has evolved as a politician since her presidential run in 2019, and especially since the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> in 2022 —&nbsp;when she became the White House’s go-to surrogate and messenger on reproductive rights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She has dominated that issue, both in official visits to states where abortion and reproductive rights have been under threat, and also during campaign swings this year that have seen her become more willing to talk about the <a href="https://abc7.com/kamala-harris-friend-high-school-canada/7846815/">personal experiences</a> that pushed her to become a sex crimes prosecutor and be able to connect with voters in a way Biden can’t.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the same time, she has been playing up that past as a prosecutor — something she was not able to do during her last national campaign against fellow Democrats. “Prosecuting the case against Donald Trump” is now a go-to part of her stump speeches, both in talking about his and his party’s record on abortion and in talking about Trump’s convictions and indictments.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the top of the ticket, she would be able to zero in on this approach against an unpopular Republican candidate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What history tells us: </strong>Before her doomed 2020 presidential bid, Harris had a successful electoral record in California: winning statewide races by tacking to the center or simply pointing out how weird or abnormal her opponents were.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Running as a center-left politician was part of her bid during her first statewide race in California — for attorney general —&nbsp;since she was facing a popular moderate Republican during a red-wave year in 2010, and she was viewed as a liberal Bay Area district attorney. She opposed right-wing positions on gay marriage and immigration enforcement, and cast her opponent as an extremist, while also attacking him for not prosecuting more cases, including sex crimes.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Her 2016 Senate campaign, meanwhile, showed how she’s able to remain on message and be disciplined —&nbsp;winning support from the Democratic establishment, consistently holding a fundraising advantage, and showing that her Democrat opponent was not a serious candidate. There wasn’t much of a policy difference between Harris and her opponent, former Los Angeles District Attorney Steve Cooley, but she was still able to deliver a landslide win.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even her 2020 campaign shows that she’s a pragmatic thinker — not necessarily tied to a specific ideology that influences the way she would approach issues. She fumbled on policy, and couldn’t make a distinctive, proactive case to the Democratic base in the primary, but she doesn’t have to do that now. Even during this cycle, she has shown moments of pragmatism, too — her position on the war in Gaza, for example, put her to the left of Biden on the issue —&nbsp;but she has found ways to speak to young progressives and voters critical of Israel’s approach while still representing the president.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The risks of swapping in Harris</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What the data says: </strong>The major problem in comparing these Harris figures to Biden’s actual standing against Trump is that Biden’s numbers factor in every negative thing that he and his campaign have endured so far. Biden backers would point to the fact that opinions of Harris could still change for the worse as her theoretical campaign becomes not so theoretical anymore, and that her performing about as evenly as Biden against Trump is not that great of a sign when there is more uncertainty about how Harris would even campaign.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On that front, they point to the fact that Harris’s favorability numbers are not that different from Biden’s, and could still get worse. In recent polls, she performs worse than Biden in battleground states like <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2024/07/18/so-you-wanted-some-harris-polling-00169524">Michigan</a>, <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-swing-state-poll-donald-trump-1927199">Arizona, and Nevada</a> — losing those states would likely doom a Democratic candidate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And she doesn’t necessarily do significantly better than Biden when looking at how subgroups of voters feel: She wins the same share of Black voters as Biden in head-to-head matchups with Trump in battleground states, <a href="https://split-ticket.org/2024/07/17/we-polled-black-voters-heres-what-we-found/">per Split-Ticket.org’s polling</a>, and does slightly worse than Biden <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/kamala-harris-biden-stronger-weaker-trump-nbc-news-poll-rcna161520">among white voters</a>, who still make up the majority of voters in swing states and nationally.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What the campaign trail shows: </strong>Taking the Kamala-critical position on the data as is — that there’s essentially no difference according to polls in how Harris performs against Trump than Biden — you are justified in being worried about what the campaign trail might look like.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris has only recently, since 2022, been active on the campaign trail, in part because she’s not the most naturally gifted campaigner or communicator. She has found the issues she excels at championing, but that’s only after going through a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/14/politics/kamala-harris-frustrating-start-vice-president/index.html">rocky</a> first <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60061473">year</a> as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/11/kamala-harris-first-six-months-vice-president-joe-biden">vice president</a> when her office saw a variety of staff departures, infighting, and missteps in message.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She received media training during that first year in order to get better at talking about the president’s agenda, but still struggled to define her portfolio —&nbsp;facing intense criticism on immigration and the border when that <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/361635/kamala-harris-border-czar-immigration-mexico-guatemala-rnc">wasn’t even her original assignment</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/05/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-kamala-harris.html">Reporters</a> who have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/10/magazine/kamala-harris.html">covering</a> her tenure point out that she seems most at home when she’s having more roundtable-style conversations, not necessarily in one-on-one interviews or while giving stump speeches.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Harris critics also point out that she will struggle to convince voters to see her as a legitimate candidate given biases against her because of her race, her gender, and the general idea that she’s not that plugged into the White House inner circle or aware of the day-to-day business of running the country.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then come the memes. While the genre of <a href="https://www.vox.com/kamala-harris/359072/kamala-harris-coconut-tree-context-unburden-meme-khive">Kamala Harris memes</a> has been exploding in popularity recently because of the chaos over Biden’s own candidacy, those jokes start from a kernel of truth: Harris is an awkward communicator. She’s prone to gaffes, to awkward jokes, to tortured analogies or stories, and is generally perceived as easy to mock.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What history tells us</strong>: Harris critics also have plenty to point to when criticizing her electoral history. Her toughest race was her first race, for California attorney general, when she was the worst-performing statewide Democratic candidate on the ballot, winning her seat by about <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/elections/2010/results/california.html?ref=politics">1 percentage point</a>.<strong> </strong>Read that again. She nearly lost to a Republican in California.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s the context that this was a red-wave year — the 2020 midterm elections were terrible for Democrats. But in California, she essentially had united Democratic support for her campaign, and still came close to failure — while every other Democratic candidate on the ticket performed significantly better.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">She cruised to victory during the 2016 Senate race in part because the whole contest was “<a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/11/2016-california-senate-harris-sanchez-jungle-open-primary-reform-214429/">uninspiring</a>,” and neither Harris nor her opponent were able to excite voters during most of the campaign because Harris’s victory was assumed from the start. She also faced an easy, flawed candidate in that race: a wacky US representative <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uuyTggFWYc">who famously “dabbed”</a> on stage during a debate.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And her 2020 presidential contest showed what happens when a candidate lacks clarity about her campaign and reasons for running. She struggled to define herself, and her position on the ideological spectrum, relative to her Democratic rivals. She could not run a disciplined campaign — two rival camps within her operation <a href="https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/359620/kamala-harris-2020-president-campaign-2024-failure-lesson">pulled the campaign in different directions</a> for much of the primary.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This record shows the legitimate reasons to question whether Harris would be able to make a proactive case for herself —&nbsp;not just a negative case against Trump. She faces the struggle of convincing voters not to blame her for the unpopular results of the Biden-Harris administration, while still thinking of her as presidential material.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s one edge the governors and senators who have been talked about as potential alternatives to Biden have: They wouldn’t carry the same baggage from the Biden administration. Harris will likely be seen as tied to Biden’s legacy,&nbsp;which stands as another reason to look elsewhere.</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">After Colorado became the first state to <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/01/worlds-first-legal-recreational-marijuana-sales-begin-in-colorado/">legalize</a> the sale of recreational cannabis to any adult in 2014, it took just 10 years for about <a href="https://disa.com/marijuana-legality-by-state">half</a> of the country to follow suit. More than 100 million adults in the US went from having no legal access to the drug to being able to waltz into their local dispensary, buy some weed, and take it home to get as stoned as they please. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, <a href="https://www.rand.org/about/people/k/kilmer_beau.html">Beau Kilmer</a>, co-director of the RAND <a href="https://www.rand.org/well-being/justice-policy/centers/dprc.html">Drug Policy Research Center</a>, sees the same kind of early activity in state psychedelic policy, including budding <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/23-0004%20%28Psilocybin%202024%29.pdf">legislation</a> to legalize sales, that he saw in cannabis right before the wave of legalizing commercial sales took off. While the medicinal use of psychedelics gains more attention and as <a href="https://reason.org/commentary/state-psychedelics-legalization-and-policy-roundup-march-2024/">states allocate funds</a> toward research, the prospect of retail psychedelics has quietly landed on our doorstep. “State policymakers, whether they like it or not, are going to start confronting these conversations,” said Kilmer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, public conversation about how a retail psychedelic market might actually work has been all but nonexistent. So far, most debate over how to expand legal access to psychedelics has focused on segmented approaches like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/355687/fda-mdma-therapy-maps-lykos-cult">therapy</a>, religious <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/12/us/psychedelic-drugs-church-religion.html">exemptions</a>, or supervised <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/03/health/psychedelic-drugs-mushrooms-oregon.html">retreat centers</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even in a world with all these models firmly in place, plus more general drug <a href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/ungass2016/Contributions/Civil/DrugPolicyAlliance/DPA_Fact_Sheet_Approaches_to_Decriminalization_Feb2015_1.pdf">decriminalization</a> across the board, there would still be plenty of people who would not be able to access psychedelics. Not everyone will or can get a prescription for their psychedelic of choice. Most people won’t be able to afford supervised programs, which run for a minimum of about <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.omniagroupashland.com/services/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1720806618065068&amp;usg=AOvVaw2vro1ey5aTfX4ZW6YD4cLK">$1,800</a> for a single, low-dose session in Oregon’s state program, or thousands more in <a href="https://www.cntraveller.com/article/the-rise-of-psychedelic-retreats">luxury retreats</a> abroad. Neither will everyone want to join a literal church in order to get religious exemption. And for anyone who doesn’t happen to have a friend who knows a guy who grows mushrooms and wants to share, decriminalizing psychedelics won’t do much to expand access on its own, either.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If ending psychedelic prohibition means all adults should have reasonable access, retail sales —&nbsp;being able to simply buy the drugs from a store —&nbsp;could help fill the gaps. But it’s easy to understand why even ardent psychedelic advocates might balk at the idea. Psychedelics do <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0293349">come with risks</a>, and more access means more exposure to those risks, which is an area where <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23954347/psychedelics-bad-trips-ketamine-mdma-psilocybin-lsd-risks">psychedelic research is lacking</a>. Plus, there’s a real concern among advocates that if psychedelic legalization moves too quickly, or too imprudently, one wrong step can plunge the whole project back into prohibition.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because it’s so easy to imagine how commercializing psychedelics could go awry, blithely selling powerful experiences that can run what seems like an infinite spectrum from <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism">revelation</a> to <a href="https://bulletin.hds.harvard.edu/a-theological-reckoning-with-bad-trips/">terror</a> is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/opinion/sunday/drug-legalization-mdma-psilocybin.html">often dismissed</a>. But our options are not limited to either the worst forms of commercialization — what some see <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/magazine/marijuana-legalization-new-york.html">already playing out</a> with cannabis — or continuing in the restrictive legacy of prohibition. There is a very wide terrain of possibilities for how to design a retail market for psychedelics that can both broaden access while retaining some regulation and safety measures. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This uncharted terrain was the subject of a <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2825-1.html">recent report published by RAND</a> —&nbsp;a think tank whose research has had <a href="https://asteriskmag.com/issues/06/when-rand-made-magic-in-santa-monica">major influence</a> on government policy since its inception as a branch of the US Air Force in 1948. Of all places, I did not expect a think tank that still works closely with the government to be advancing the conversation around how to sell psychedelics to people outside of therapy clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">RAND’s report joins Transform Drug Policy Foundation’s “<a href="https://transformdrugs.org/publications/how-to-regulate-psychedelics">How to Regulate Psychedelics</a>,” published late last year, as some of the first major pieces of policy research to begin mapping the possible policy options for designing a retail psychedelics market.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The federal government currently has multiple options when it comes to the supply of psychedelics, but it does not have unlimited time,” the report states. Legislation for retail psychedelics is already getting off the ground in some states, like the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/initiatives/pdfs/23-0004%20%28Psilocybin%202024%29.pdf">California Psilocybin Initiative</a>. “Now is the time for US federal policymakers to decide whether they want psilocybin and other psychedelic substances to follow in the footsteps of the for-profit cannabis model.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Psychedelic therapy isn’t enough to put an end to the restrictive legacy of prohibition. And while it’s easy enough to say that psychedelics should never have been fully outlawed, as they were in 1970, thinking through how to make them legal and accessible for everyone is to confront a thicket of questions that we’ve only just begun to grapple with.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">The varieties of retail psychedelics</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So if we’re going to consider the retail sale of psychedelics, how can we go about it without, you know, plunging society into a psychedelic nightmare fueled by abundant corner-store mushrooms, Juul-branded DMT vape pens in young people’s innocent hands, and flooded emergency rooms with no idea how to help people whose perceptions of the world have melted into an all-consuming, pulsating void?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Kilmer explained that the logistics of retail psychedelics fall into one of two categories: supply architectures and design considerations. Supply architectures come first. Who gets to sell psychedelics? The RAND report lays out a taxonomy of options, including sales by a government authority, sales by nonprofits, sales by for-benefit corporations, and full-on for-profit sales.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In this view, the most modest step in retail would be letting the government have a monopoly on distribution. That’s how many US states <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2020-01-16/end-of-prohibition-gave-states-a-new-job-regulating-liquor">handled</a> the end of alcohol prohibition in the 1930s (and some states still do). It’s also how a number of Canadian <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/canadian-cannabis-stores-by-provinces-territories/">provinces</a>, like Quebec and Nova Scotia, do cannabis sales today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A government monopoly on psychedelic sales has a few benefits. A single government supplier would make monitoring product safety easier (as in, no MDMA <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8282667/">laced with fentanyl</a>, which is increasingly a problem on the black market, or sketchy mushroom chocolates that <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigation-illnesses-diamond-shruumz-brand-chocolate-bars-cones-gummies-june-2024">actually make you sick</a>). The absence of retail competition would mean the incentives for irresponsible marketing that pushes psychedelics onto new consumers — <a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-new-york-city-marijuana-business-4245bb958368e1863d7ac9b639886790">a problem</a> with the cannabis market — would be turned way down. I do not imagine the government would erect billboards advertising their LSD products. (In the 1950s, for instance, they kept pretty quiet about their LSD experiments for <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/hearings/95mkultra.pdf">mind control and military uses</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That said, giving the government the sole power to legally sell psychedelics after President Nixon’s government drove them underground in the first place would be an irony to behold. And RAND’s report noted that even in the cannabis legalization realm, the idea of sticking to state-run stores didn’t gain much traction in the US.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One step further would be legalizing sales through only certain types of organizations, like non-profits or for-benefit corporations. For example, when New York handed out its <a href="https://www.nysscpa.org/news/publications/the-trusted-professional/article/nonprofits-awarded-cannabis-dispensary-licenses-include-three-based-in-nyc-112222">first wave of retail licenses</a> for cannabis, they went to either non-profits or equity applicants (mostly people with past cannabis-related convictions). By concentrating retail licenses with organizations that have goals other than profit, some of the potential excesses of commercializing psychedelics, from excessive marketing to skirting regulations in search of more revenue, could potentially be counterbalanced by emphases on public health or equity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Applying a bit more restriction, some countries, like Uruguay, Spain, and now <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/germanys-parliament-votes-to-legalize-limited-marijuana-possession-and-allow-cannabis-clubs">Germany</a>, have allowed a non-profit collective model for cannabis that could be adapted for psychedelics, through what are known as “<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149291823001297">social clubs</a>.” These provide on-site locations where members can purchase and use drugs with varying degrees of community and peer support built in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And finally, the approach that now dominates cannabis in the US: for-profit sales. In theory, a for-profit approach could benefit consumers by enlisting competition to push prices down. But it also creates an incentive for companies to push against regulations in search of a financial edge, while both advertising and innovating to seek out as many new customers as possible. THC gummies are one thing, but LSD-infused ring pops? Psilocybin bubble tea? This leads down a slippery slope that makes even advocates uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although cannabis parallels are abundant, there are major differences when thinking about following the same model for psychedelics. Kilmer explained that retail cannabis was driven by two major motivations: to reduce arrests and generate state tax revenue. But he thinks that neither will really factor into psychedelic policy reform. Both the number of arrests and the amount of revenue associated with psychedelics (according to RAND’s survey of psilocybin users) are far less than with cannabis. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And he expects the actual market dynamics to have at least three major differences, too. First, he thinks psychedelic consumers will be far less sensitive to changes in price than cannabis. Cannabis users can always turn to its robust black market if they balk at the price of a blunt, but someone hunting for LSD will likely have a harder time. Second, the question of supervised use is basically non-existent with cannabis, which is essentially consumed much like alcohol, but is a big part of psychedelic use, where even recreational consumers may want to keep someone around to watch over them. And third, while many people use cannabis frequently, RAND’s survey data found that infrequent users drive the psychedelic market as it exists today.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Among any of the supply architectures, success or failure will come down to the massive list of design considerations. Who gets to manufacture (or grow) the drugs, and how can we ensure quality control? How should we regulate the packaging of retail psychedelic products? How can we effectively communicate informed consent? What strategies for public education can help create models of responsible use? What kinds of advertising are acceptable? Should doses be restricted at all? What kind of harm reduction information should come with purchases?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I could go on for a very long time with these sorts of questions, which will need more than two lengthy think tank reports to navigate. The reports from Transform and RAND have at least started the important work of taking them seriously, rather than turning away at the first depiction of psychedelic capitalism gone awry. But we’ll need much more data and analysis to make sense of what prudent steps forward might actually look like. “Once I really started digging in and crunching the numbers, I realized that a lot of the data we need just doesn’t exist,” said Kilmer.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And with retail legislation already in the works, we’ll need it fast.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none">New York proposes a potentially reasonable way forward: psychedelic permits</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Advocates for psychedelics access have been hearing that “we need to wait for more data” for quite some time. And in many cases where psychedelics could help, like for people <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/15/24156372/psychedelics-chronic-pain-cluster-headache-medicine-lsd-psilocybin">suffering from debilitating chronic pain</a> or PTSD, every day spent waiting is another day in pain.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Which is part of what makes <a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2023/A10375#:~:text=Allows%20the%20growth%2C%20cultivation%2C%20and%20regulated%20adult%20use%20of%20psilocybin,and%20the%20licensure%20of%20cultivators.">the bill</a> introduced in May by New York State Representative Amy Paulin, who chairs the Assembly Health Committee, so interesting. It offers a way forward that doesn’t require waiting for policymakers to figure out how to whip up and regulate an entire retail market before offering access. The other part is that among the options for actually stepping into retail psychedelics, it strikes me as by far the most reasonable approach to balancing expanding access while keeping an emphasis on safety.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bill would essentially take our approach to driving licenses, and adapt it for psychedelics. People 18 and up would have to go through a health screening, take an educational course, and pass a test, after which they’d receive a permit to buy psychedelics (in this bill’s case, only psilocybin) from licensed vendors. They could then take the drugs home and use as they please. They could also then grow the mushrooms at home, and share them with other permitted adults.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Whereas approaches outlined in Transform and RAND’s reports focus on licensing the <em>supply</em> of psychedelics, the permit model adds another layer of protection by focusing on who’s licensed to purchase and consume them. There will be, no doubt, people upset by the idea of requiring a government permit to purchase or consume psychedelics. But the same is required of other activities that pose a reasonable threat to oneself and others, like driving. If the alternative is no retail access whatsoever, let them holler.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The bill tries to fill in some of the missing logistics around how to actually pull this off, specifying that licensed mushroom cultivators could sell psilocybin directly to permit holders via a system managed by the Department of Health, which would also oversee the content of the permit course. Of course, questions abound. What will the health screenings screen for? Should permitting include a guided trip as an experiential component? How will permit holders be connected with support services, should something go wrong? What goes into becoming a licensed cultivator? </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, an approach that requires licensing at each step of the commercial journey, from production to distribution to consumption, builds in plenty of opportunities for regulation, while still filling the gaps in supply left by therapy, supervised programs, or religious exemptions. And by requiring permits for consumers, it leans deeper into harm reduction than the for-profit cannabis model that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/03/magazine/marijuana-legalization-new-york.html">coming under increasing criticism</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is no approach to retail psychedelics that’s without risk. But cars killed <a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/ViewPublication/813561">nearly 41,000</a> Americans last year alone, and we keep licensing people to use those. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Obviously, there are a number of concerns, especially if you were to unleash a commercial industry,” said Kilmer. “But at the end of the day, you can have the best empirical evidence out there with minimal uncertainty, and a lot of it still just comes down to the values and risk preferences for the people making decisions.”</p>

<p>I woke up the day after Valentine’s Day bleary-eyed, fuzzy-headed, and with a slight pit in my stomach.</p>

<p>I hadn’t overdrank. I hadn’t been ghosted, scorned, or broken up with either. In fact, I’m happily married to a man who rolls his eyes at the Hallmark holiday but knows how to woo me: namely, via wings and beer, which we’d savored the night before, along with a variety show of sorts at our friend’s Brooklyn loft. On the surface, the night had been just right. But my gut told a different story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It reminded me that, the day prior, I’d been reporting a mental health story that had seeped deep into my psyche. I’d felt misunderstood by a relative when I’d tried to open up about it. I’d cried during the show’s opening musical act because, well, I’m a sap. </p>

<p>So come February 15, I — surely along with plenty of others for a variety of reasons — awoke to an emotional hangover, or that groggy, queasy feeling that lingers after a heavy conversation, therapy session, or even dark movie. While not an official medical term, the “condition” is quite common, and makes sense from a physiological and psychological perspective, experts told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Our reactions [to the outside world] are driven by our internal world, and our internal world is influenced by what happened yesterday,” <a href="https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/lila-davachi">Lila Davachi, PhD</a>, a psychology professor at Columbia University who’s studied how emotions affect memories, said. “We’re not just blank slates every morning.”  </p>

<p>I felt better already. Here’s what else I learned about why we might experience emotional hangovers, who’s most vulnerable, and whether there’s anything we can do to prevent — or pacify — them. Spoiler alert: Water and rest are tried-and-true hangover cures, even if you’re sober. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Defining the emotional hangover&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Different people have different definitions of emotional hangovers. Perhaps most prominently, <a href="https://drjudithorloff.com/9-strategies-to-cure-emotional-hangovers/">Judith Orloff, MD,</a> a psychiatrist and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Empaths-Survival-Guide-Strategies-Sensitive/dp/1622036573"><em>The Empath’s Survival Guide</em></a>, describes it as “an energetic residue” left over from an interaction with an “energy vampire,” or someone who, intentionally or not, saps your mental and emotional energy. </p>

<p>“Toxic emotions can linger long afterward, which make you feel exhausted, beset with brain fog, or ill,” she writes.</p>

<p>In my case, it wasn’t any particular person from whom I needed to recover, but rather a set of mildly emotionally fatiguing circumstances that didn’t subside simply because the sun had risen again. (Importantly, I’m not talking about the emotional aftermath of world-rocking life events like the death of a loved one, which is more aptly categorized as grief — and better appreciated as something that will and should take time to nurse.)</p>

<p>I’ve had emotional hangovers after finishing haunting books, receiving hate mail from readers, and getting into disagreements with my spouse.</p>

<p>“The day after something that’s really intense, it’s natural to feel lingering feelings of sadness or shame,” <a href="https://meganbruneau.com/">Megan Bruneau</a>, a therapist and coach, says. The concept reminds her of “vulnerability hangovers,” or uncomfortable feelings like anxiety and regret that can arise after sharing deep emotions, needs, or desires, according to mental health website <a href="https://www.choosingtherapy.com/vulnerability-hangover/">Choosing Therapy</a>. </p>

<p>Per Orloff, frequent emotional hangovers are most common among empaths, highly sensitive people, and those with social anxiety disorder. In other words, when your emotional antenna is highly attuned to others’ thoughts and behaviors, minor social blips become amplified. What’s a breeze on others’ radars is a gust on yours.  </p>

<p>This perspective resonates with Abby Schaeffer, a 33-year-old flight attendant based in New York City. “I feel emotions really deeply — when I get into a fight with someone, I am torn up about it. My partner, by contrast, is like, ‘Well they’re wrong, so whatever,’” she said. “For people like me, emotional hangovers are a thing because you spend so much energy just processing the event.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The brain and body during an emotional hangover&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p>While a hangover-hangover is well-understood as a mix of dehydration, poor quality sleep, and other physical consequences of too much booze, the mechanisms behind emotional hangovers are a little more medically elusive. But experts have some theories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For one, during an emotional experience — say, a confrontation with a slacking colleague — your fight-or-flight system is activated, leading stress hormones like cortisol, norepinephrine, and adrenaline to surge through the body. When the moment passes and your body settles into a “rest and digest” state, you might feel especially worn down. “When we’re repairing after the stress response, it’s tiring,” Bruneau says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The feeling could also reflect the mental tug-of-war between your amygdala, the part of your brain that’s processing your emotions, and your prefrontal cortex, or the part of your brain that’s trying to temper them with logic and decisions. “It’s mentally exhausting to be managing your feelings of anger and anxiety, and trying to be non-reactive,” Bruneau says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some research also shows that highly emotional events light up the brain in certain ways — and that light doesn’t switch off as soon as the event ends. In her <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4468">2016 study</a> in the journal <em>Nature Neuroscience</em>, Davachi and colleagues measured people’s brain activity while viewing both emotional and neutral images. They found that the brain states associated with the emotional experiences lingered 20 to 30 minutes later, sharpening the participants’ memory of subsequent non-emotional images.</p>

<p>It shows that, unlike a video recording, “we’re much more complicated in how we’re viewing, perceiving, and remembering the world,” Davachi says.  </p>

<p>Similarly, emotional moments can corrupt our attention — shining the light on happy-looking couples after a fight with your partner, or causing you to misinterpret your friend’s silence after an awkward encounter with a different pal. By ruminating on negative feelings, you’re (often unintentionally) delaying your recovery.   </p>

<p>“Your perception is being heightened toward the things that are relevant to that person or that trauma, but you might actually be suppressing everything else,” Davachi says. “And that’s maladaptive too, because if good stuff is happening to you too, like you get a nice note in the mail, you’re going to not let that improve your mood the way that it should.”</p>

<p>Your emotional hangover might not be so complicated: Maybe you just failed to breathe deeply, or drink enough water, or eat well while engrossed in a tragic movie. Your sleep could have been more fitful too. “When we’re stressed, we tend to not take care of ourselves as well,” Bruneau says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, emotional hangovers are yet another indication that our bodies and minds are connected, <a href="https://chronicillnessandjoy.com/bio.html">Kristen Guest</a>, a licensed social worker, says. “Our bodies are definitely going to feel it if our mind is overpowered or overstimulated. Nothing just happens in a silo.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Your emotional hangover first-aid kit&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Emotional hangovers aren’t inherently bad; they’re human. They might mean you need to set better boundaries or improve communication or practice sitting with uncomfortable emotions and conflict. If you find the feelings are frequent and disruptive, you might need to do something more drastic, like quit a job or break up with a friend. Consider abstinence from the figurative substance that’s no longer serving you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s good to receive those signals in some cases, <em>and</em> we need to train our brains and our bodies to respond in different ways,” Guest says. She recommends drinking lots of water and journaling to help you notice patterns in what, where, and who tends to sap you emotionally. “It’s important to take time for reflection,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Working through it with a therapist can be immensely helpful too, <a href="https://emilysarahhein.com/">Emily Hein</a>, a writer and social work student, has found. She’s learned, for example, that an outsize reaction to her current partner’s comment might be related to something a former partner said. </p>

<p>“We tend to lump all of these things together and it’s really hard to be like, ‘No, let’s just approach this particular situation as it is,’” she says. “It’s definitely a push-pull between your mind and your body, and knowing that you’re safe while also validating that it’s okay for your brain to not feel like it’s safe. Your brain is pulling evidence from things that did happen.” </p>

<p>For her, watching a show, playing a video game, or taking a walk can all put helpful space between the event and her reaction. Like a margarita-induced hangover, time heals, Schaeffer has also found. “Just be kind to yourself the next day,” she says. “That’s the rule I follow.”&nbsp;</p>

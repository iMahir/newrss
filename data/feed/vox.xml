	<figcaption>President Donald Trump looks on as Justice Brett Kavanaugh was sworn into the Supreme Court.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">On October 23, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that many voters who cast a mailed-in ballot improperly, thus rendering their vote “void,” should be <a href="https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-82B-2024mo%20-%20106118370285553688.pdf?cb=1">allowed to cast a ballot on Election Day</a> that will actually be counted. Though it’s <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/articles/how-many-naked-ballots-were-cast-pennsylvanias-2020-general-election">hard to pin down</a> exactly how many voters will be impacted by this decision, it’s likely that thousands of Pennsylvanians will regain their ability to vote in the November election if the state supreme court’s decision remains in effect.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The case, which was known as <a href="https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-82B-2024mo%20-%20106118370285553688.pdf?cb=1"><em>Genser v. Butler County Board of Elections</em></a> when it was decided by the state supreme court, involves a genuinely difficult legal question that required the state’s justices to resolve a conflict between two competing legal principles. It split them 4-3, with four Democrats forming the majority and two Republicans and one Democrat in dissent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, the Republican Party <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25255962/scotus-24a408-stay-application-pa.pdf">asked the US Supreme Court to intervene</a> and effectively disenfranchise the thousands of voters who will be allowed to vote if the state court’s <em>Genser</em> decision stands. That alone is a very big deal. If the 2024 presidential election is very close, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">as is expected</a>, and if victory comes down to which candidate wins Pennsylvania, a US Supreme Court decision in favor of the GOP could flip the winner of this election from Kamala Harris to Donald Trump. (Although more Republicans are expected to vote by mail than in 2020, Democrats <a href="https://www.vox.com/donald-trump/379351/donald-trump-january-6-election-2024-supreme-court">likely still have an advantage with this cohort</a>.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But this case could also have massive implications for US democracy that extend far beyond the 2024 election, even if Harris wins in a landslide.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">State supreme courts are supposed to be the final word on all questions of state law. The ultimate authority on the question in <em>Genser</em> has spoken, and the US Supreme Court ought to butt out. Nevertheless, the GOP argues that the high Court needs to get involved because of something known as the “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/4/23481063/supreme-court-moore-harper-independent-state-legislature-doctrine-elections">independent state legislature doctrine</a>” (ISLD), a chaotic legal theory that the Supreme Court has rejected many times over the last century.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the justices accept the GOP’s arguments, they will introduce unprecedented chaos into US elections, putting in doubt which officials are responsible for election law — and even whether voters or their elected officials get to decide who wins in elections.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The independent state legislature doctrine would destabilize the United States and threaten its security</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In its strongest form, the ISLD claims that each state’s legislative branch has exclusive authority to determine how federal elections are conducted in that state. That means that a state governor cannot veto laws governing federal elections, even if the state constitution typically allows the governor to veto bills passed by the legislature. It means that states cannot alter their election laws through ballot initiatives or referendums. It means that state courts cannot enforce state constitutional provisions that protect the right to vote. And it even calls into question state court decisions interpreting state election laws.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <em>Genser</em>, the Republican Party doesn’t go to any of those extremes. But they do claim that by interpreting Pennsylvania law to permit the impacted voters to cast a ballot on Election Day, the state supreme court robbed the state legislature of its supposedly exclusive authority to write election laws.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even in its weaker forms, the ISLD is dangerous. The last time an independent state legislature doctrine case was before the Court, in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf"><em>Moore v. Harper</em></a> (2023), an array of conservative luminaries and former top national security officials <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/4/23481063/supreme-court-moore-harper-independent-state-legislature-doctrine-elections">warned the justices to stay far, far away from the ISLD</a>, lest they destabilize America’s entire system for choosing its leaders. That included a brief on behalf of retired admirals, generals, and service secretaries — some of whom held high-level political appointments in Republican administrations — who warned that the ISLD “undermines election integrity and <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1271/243970/20221026122043996_Ret.%20Admirals%20AmicusBrief%20-%20Moore%20v.%20Harper.pdf">exacerbates both domestic and foreign threats to national security</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">For the most part, the Court heeded these warnings in <em>Moore</em>. Although <a href="https://casetext.com/case/arizona-state-legislature-v-arizona-independent-redistricting-commn">Chief Justice John Roberts</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/21540145/supreme-court-brett-kavanaugh-disputed-election-wisconsin-pennsylvania-north-carolina">Justice Brett Kavanaugh</a> had both expressed sympathy for the ISLD in the past, they largely reversed course in <em>Moore</em> — joining four of their colleagues in an opinion that mostly rejected this legal doctrine.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But <em>Moore</em> was not a total victory for democracy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Historically, each state’s highest court has had the final word on all questions of state law. The US Supreme Court can intervene if a state violates federal law, or if a state supreme court hands down a decision that violates the US Constitution. But if a state supreme court interprets its own state’s law in a way that the federal justices don’t like, they are supposed to shut up and accept that they don’t have any power over a state’s internal self-governance.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Roberts’s majority opinion in <em>Moore</em>, however, included a cryptic line creating an exception to the rule that state courts have the final word on questions of state law. “[S]tate courts,” Roberts wrote, “<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf">may not transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review</a> such that they arrogate to themselves the power vested in state legislatures to regulate federal elections.” <em>Moore</em>, however, did not explain what, exactly, it means to “transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As a practical matter, that means that <em>Moore</em> gave the US Supreme Court an unprecedented new power to overrule state election law decisions that at least five justices don’t like. It also means that <em>Moore</em> shifted a great deal of authority to the Republican Party — Republicans have a 6-3 majority on the US Supreme Court and <em>Moore</em> means that any five of these Republicans can reverse a state court decision that benefits Democrats.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The question in <em>Genser</em> is whether the Republican justices will use this self-given power, for the first time, to give Donald Trump an unfair advantage in Pennsylvania.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">So where does the ISLD come from?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The independent state legislature doctrine is one of those very bad ideas that rears its head every few decades, only to get shut down when it reaches the Supreme Court. The Court first rejected the ISLD in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6094069846348614449&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr"><em>Davis v. Hildebrant</em></a> (1916), which upheld a provision of the Ohio constitution permitting the people of the state to veto state election laws via a popular referendum, even though that meant blocking a law enacted by the state’s legislative branch. The Court also handed down significant decisions rejecting the ISLD in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1547832757359985052&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr">1932</a> and in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/13-1314#writing-13-1314_OPINION_3">2015</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A likely reason why this doctrine refuses to stay dead is that it actually sounds plausible if you read the text of the Constitution without doing any legal or historical research. One provision of the Constitution states that “the times, places and manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlei#:~:text=Article%20I%20describes%20the%20design,the%20powers%20that%20Congress%20has.">shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof</a>.” Meanwhile, another <a href="https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/article/article-ii">provision</a> says that presidential elections shall also be conducted in a way determined by the state legislature.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So the argument for the ISLD is deceptively simple: The Constitution states that the rules governing federal elections are set by a state’s “legislature.” Governors, state courts, and state constitutions are not part of the legislative branch of government. Therefore they have no say in how federal elections are conducted.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The problem with this argument is that it is anachronistic. When the Constitution was drafted, the concept of a popularly elected legislative body was a relatively new innovation, and the word “legislature” did not always refer to a body, like the US Congress, which was defined as the “legislative” branch of government. Instead, it meant, in the words of one 1828 dictionary, “<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/4/23481063/supreme-court-moore-harper-independent-state-legislature-doctrine-elections">the body of men in a state or kingdom, invested with power to make and repeal laws</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Or, as the Supreme Court held in <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/13-1314#writing-13-1314_OPINION_3"><em>Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission</em></a> (2015), the word “legislature” refers to “the power that makes laws.” That power can be vested in a congress or parliament. But it can also be partially vested in a state governor (who has the power to veto laws), in a state supreme court (which has the power to interpret laws), or in the people of a state as a whole (who may have the power to make laws via ballot initiatives or referendums).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Proponents of the ISLD, in other words, aren’t actually trying to preserve a separation of powers that existed when the Constitution was written. They want to create an entirely novel regime that upends existing state constitutions and gives unprecedented power to a Republican Supreme Court.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the immediate stakes in <em>Genser</em>?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even setting aside the long-term stakes in this case, <em>Genser</em> is a big deal solely because it could change the outcome of the 2024 presidential election — although the likelihood of such an outcome is difficult to predict because it turns on two unknown variables: 1) How much of an advantage will Democrats have over Republicans among Pennsylvanians who vote by mail? and 2) How many of these voters will be impacted by the <em>Genser</em> decision?</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>Genser</em> arises out of a quirk of Pennsylvania law. In order to cast a mailed ballot, the voter must stuff their ballot inside two separate envelopes. The first, often referred to as the “outer envelope,” includes information that can identify the voter who cast a particular ballot. The second, known as the “secrecy envelope,” does not. Pennsylvania law, moreover, is unusually unforgiving to voters who do not properly stuff their ballot in this second envelope: In 2020, the state supreme court held that <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/2020/133-mm-2020-1.html">a ballot that is not properly stuffed is “void.”</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The plaintiffs in <em>Genser</em> are two voters who previously attempted to vote by mail, but their ballots were canceled because they didn’t properly stuff them. The state then sent them an email informing them that their ballots were voided and advising them that “<a href="https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Supreme/out/J-82B-2024mo%20-%20106118370285553688.pdf?cb=1">you can go to your polling place on election day and cast a provisional ballot</a>.” Yet, when these two voters did exactly that, the state reversed course and decided not to count their provisional ballots after all.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It turns out that the legal question of whether a Pennsylvania voter who casts a voided mailed ballot may then vote via a provisional ballot is unusually difficult. On the one hand, Pennsylvania law states that a provisional ballot “shall not be counted” if the same voter’s “<a href="https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-25-ps-elections-electoral-districts/pa-st-sect-25-3050/">mail-in ballot is timely received by a county board of elections</a>.” So that statutory language is certainly helpful to the Republican Party’s position in <em>Genser</em>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On the other hand, the state supreme court previously held that ballots cast without the secrecy envelope are “void.” As the same court explains in its <em>Genser</em> opinion, something that is “void” must be given “no legal effect.” So, under this reading of Pennsylvania law, a mailed ballot that is submitted without a secrecy envelope must be treated as if it did not exist — and thus it cannot prevent the same voter from casting a provisional ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Is that a persuasive argument? The honest answer is that this case split the court 4-3 for a reason. Both possible interpretations of state law are plausible, and a majority of the state’s justices decided to go with the option that is more consistent with democratic principles.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s difficult to estimate exactly how many voters could be impacted by <em>Genser</em>. An <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/articles/how-many-naked-ballots-were-cast-pennsylvanias-2020-general-election">MIT investigation</a> into this question found that “about 6.4 percent of the 3,086 mail ballots cast in the 2019 general election in Philadelphia were rejected for not being enclosed within a secrecy envelope.” But during the 2020 election, “massive voter-education efforts” successfully reduced this number. A Philadelphia spokesperson claimed that <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/articles/how-many-naked-ballots-were-cast-pennsylvanias-2020-general-election">only 1.1 percent of mailed ballots</a> were rejected for this reason in 2020, and this number was much lower in other parts of the state.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, even if you assume that only a quarter of Pennsylvania voters will cast a mailed ballot in 2024, which is <a href="https://www.centredaily.com/news/politics-government/election/article293827044.html">probably a low estimate</a>, and that only 1 percent of those votes will not properly stuff their ballot in the secrecy envelope, that’s still a whole lot of voters. In 2020, <a href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/pennsylvania/">nearly 7 million people</a> cast a presidential vote in Pennsylvania. So, if a quarter of ballots were mailed in and 1 percent of those were invalidated, that’s more than 17,000 votes tossed out.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">How many of those tossed-out votes would be for Harris is unclear. Though Republican participation in mail-in voting is higher than it was in 2020, the mere fact that the GOP has taken the position it&#8217;s taken in <em>Genser</em> suggests they expect mailed ballots to favor Democrats, <a href="https://electionlab.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2021-03/HowWeVotedIn2020-March2021.pdf">as was the case in 2020</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Realistically, preventing these voters from having their votes counted will not change the result of the 2024 election unless the whole thing comes down to Pennsylvania — and unless Harris leads Trump by only a few thousand ballots. But, in that scenario, a victory for the Republican Party in <em>Genser</em> would change the course of American history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and campaign surrogate for former President Donald Trump, recently announced a plan to give away $1 million each day until November 5 to a randomly chosen person who’s signed a petition from his political action committee.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To win the money, the signee must be a registered swing state voter — and that criterion has raised concerns that Musk may be in <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2023-title52/pdf/USCODE-2023-title52-subtitleI-chap103-sec10307.pdf">violation of a federal law</a> that makes it illegal to pay people (or offer them an incentive) to either register to vote or cast a ballot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think there&#8217;s a strong argument that there&#8217;s potential criminal liability here, so at the very least [the Department of Justice] should be investigating and should be warning people not to be doing this,” <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=146397">Richard Hasen</a>, director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA Law School, told Vox.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Monday, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/28/2024-election-campaign-updates-harris-trump/#link-TKYLI67SXBD75FWTBKZRWPR7U4">filed suit against Musk and his America PAC over the contest</a>, saying that the lottery violates Pennsylvania’s consumer protection laws and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/7b2d9dbc-e06f-4764-a786-312ca869a613.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_7" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/7b2d9dbc-e06f-4764-a786-312ca869a613.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_7">requesting that a judge stop the contest</a> while the suit plays out. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Krasner’s suit follows a complaint by public advocacy group Public Citizen <a href="https://www.citizen.org/article/elon-musk-violated-campaign-finance-law-complaint-to-fec/">filed with the Federal Elections Commission</a>, which alleges<strong> </strong>that the contest violates campaign finance law because “the purpose of the $1 million reward for signing the petition appears to be to motivate voter registration and voting at the polls by those sympathetic with the candidacy of Donald Trump in the key swing states for the 2024 presidential election.” The DOJ also reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/elon-musk-department-of-justice-giveaway.html">sent a letter</a> to a lawyer for Musk’s PAC warning that the contest might violate the law. Neither the DOJ nor a representative for the PAC have commented publicly on the warning.</p>

<iframe frameborder="0" height="200" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP3354574880" width="100%"></iframe>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The program works like this: Registered voters in Arizona, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, or Wisconsin —&nbsp;all swing states that could go for either Vice President Kamala Harris or Trump come Election Day — can sign the <a href="https://petition.theamericapac.org/">petition</a>, which claims to be a “Petition in Favor of Free Speech and the Right to Bear Arms” until Monday, October 21, <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/pages/VoterRegistrationApplication.aspx">which happens to be the voter registration deadline in Pennsylvania</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The petition is being circulated by Musk’s America PAC, which has taken over much of Trump’s ground operation in <a href="https://wapo.st/4fw1Tij">key swing states</a>. Musk has made Pennsylvania a particular focus of his personal outreach, hosting events there, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pro-trump-group-funded-by-musk-struggles-with-outreach-targets-inflation-2024-10-18/">including one on Sunday</a> where he handed a woman in a Trump-Vance shirt a giant $1 million check.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though the petition does not require signers to be registered Republicans, the focus on the First and Second Amendments does seem to<strong> </strong>appeal to potential Trump voters who fear Democrats will take away their gun rights and who subscribe to Musk’s idea of “<a href="https://www.cato.org/commentary/elon-musk-sues-critics-silence-so-much-free-speech">free speech</a>.” The net effect, then, is that Musk is promising $1 million a day to a program aimed at getting pro-Trump voters registered in swing states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Because his contest is only open to registered voters, there may be a case for it to<strong> </strong>be understood as an illegal financial incentive to get people to register to vote, as Public Citizen’s complaint alleges. One issue Musk faces, said <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/team/david-becker/">David Becker</a>, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, is that what constitutes payment for voting-related activity has been broadly interpreted in the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“This could involve anything of value,” Becker said. The law “has been applied to things like <a href="https://www.abajournal.com/news/article/election_law_blogger_responsible_for_free_ben_jerrys">Ben &amp; Jerry&#8217;s offering everyone who has an ‘I Voted’ sticker an ice cream cone on Election Day</a>. They received a cease-and-desist letter and changed [the promotion to give] everyone a free ice cream cone on Election Day.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There is some ambiguity in Musk’s promotion, compared to what Ben &amp; Jerry’s offered, however. The uncertainty arises from the fact that Musk’s PAC is asking people to sign a petition for the chance to win $1 million, not explicitly rewarding them for registering to vote.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/about/leadership/daniel-i-weiner">Daniel Weiner</a>, director of the Brennan Center’s Elections &amp; Government Program, told Vox that the issue at hand really comes down to whether entering a specific group of people in a lottery if they sign a petition counts as paying people to register to vote.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There&#8217;s certainly an argument that it is, [but] I think&nbsp;it&#8217;s hard to know for sure how to predict how this would play out in court,” Weiner said.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called the contest “concerning,” and said it was “something that law enforcement could take a look at” in an appearance on <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/pennsylvania-gov-shapiro-law-enforcement-take-look-elon-musk-voter-pay-rcna176279">NBC’s <em>Meet the Press </em>on Sunday</a>. Thus far, the federal government hasn’t announced any investigation into the contest.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If indeed the Justice Department decided to pursue Musk, it would first send a cease-and-desist letter —&nbsp;just like the one Ben &amp; Jerry’s received back in 2008. From there, he would have to decide how to respond; the penalty for breaking the law is $10,000 or a maximum of five years in prison.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But even if the DOJ decides to go after Musk for this —&nbsp;and there is no guarantee that it will —&nbsp;the issue likely won’t be resolved before November 5, in part to avoid any perception on the part of the federal government that the DOJ is meddling in the election.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“There are important norms around initiating investigations and legal proceedings in the runup to an election. Otherwise, they can potentially launch an investigation after the election, and whether they will is something that&#8217;s difficult to predict,” Weiner said. “I think that this is something whose legality will not be resolved before the election.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, October 28, 11:50 am ET: </em></strong><em>This story, originally published October 21, has been updated to include information about Public Citizen’s FEC complaint, the DOJ’s letter to Musk’s PAC, and a lawsuit filed by the Philadelphia district attorney.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/362300/kamala-harris-meme-brat-summer">Charli xcx memes</a> to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mxwlch03/video/7394583648571313424?q=kamala%20charli%20xcx&amp;t=1724087690722">fan-made</a> covers interpolating her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mindyrose7/video/7394876881708780842?q=america%20has%20a%20problem%20kamala&amp;t=1724087650306">famous “coconut tree” quote</a>, Kamala Harris’s last-minute presidential bid against Republican candidate Donald Trump has had a fascinating and outsized relationship with pop music.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Various progressive singers, like <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/kamala-harris-president-katy-perry-ariana-grande-jamie-lee-curtis-b2583697.html">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/olivia-rodrigo-kamala-harris-reproductive-rights-1236082554/">Olivia Rodrigo</a>, have pledged their support. Katy Perry <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/katy-perry-hopes-kamalas-run-for-president-can-save-womans-world">offered</a> one of her latest singles, “Woman’s World,” for the vice president to use in her campaign, though Harris doesn’t seem to have taken her up on it. Meanwhile, Harris’s staff has found ways to use pop music to attract Gen Z voters, having <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/megan-thee-stallion-performs-mamushi-body-kamala-harris-atlanta-rally-1235743523/">Megan Thee Stallion</a> perform at an Atlanta rally and fully embracing brat memes. This onslaught of memes and coconut-themed “remixes” has almost overshadowed the most crucial music-related decision involved in Harris’s candidacy: her campaign song.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last month, it was <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/beyonce-kamala-harris-campaign-freedom-rcna163599">reported</a> that Beyoncé permitted the Harris (now Harris-Walz) campaign to use her song “Freedom” featuring Kendrick Lamar. Since then, the rousing gospel-tinged anthem from her 2016 album<em> Lemonade</em> has soundtracked Harris’s rally entrances and will inevitably be heard several times at this week’s Democratic National Convention. On the last day of the DNC, there was even speculation that Beyoncé herself could make an appearance.&nbsp;While she was ultimately a no-show, Beyoncé made her long-awaited appearance at a Harris’s rally on October 25 in Houston, after <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/10/24/beyonce-kamala-harris-houston-rally/">reports that she was slated to perform</a>. Beyoncé, along with her fellow Destiny’s Child member Kelly Rowland, instead gave a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/beyonce-kamala-harris-6b3f928bb7fd5a705f32ac3d04b89ed8">rousing speech</a> before introducing Harris.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m not here as a celebrity,” she told the crowd. “I’m not here as a politician. I’m here as a mother, a mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in, a world where we have the freedom to control our bodies, a world where we’re not divided.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The modern campaign song has become its own character — and target of inspection — in election politics. Most of these songs have already achieved popularity outside of the campaign trail, so they need to be vital enough to reenergize constituents. They also have to be memorable and on message, embodying the values and promises of the candidate. But are they actually useful? What does it mean for a song to belong to a campaign?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Post-Trump, pop music is also something that Democrats have been able to leverage against the right — not just big hits themselves but endorsements from the artists who make them. Conversely, there’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musicians_who_oppose_Donald_Trump%27s_use_of_their_music">Wikipedia page of musicians</a> who have opposed Trump’s use of their music on the campaign trail, in addition to opposing him as president. However, the results of the 2016 presidential election have made the public <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/11/election-celebrities-trump-clinton-endorsements-beyonce-springsteen-david-jackson-bowling-green/507383/">second-guess</a> the power of pop music in this sphere.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite this skepticism, Dana Gorzelany-Mostak, an associate professor of music at Georgia College, argues that music can be an effective medium for politicians. “While it might not drive people to the polls, music models ways of being in the world and connecting with others,” she says.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><em>This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</em></p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/GettyImages-621629084.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.63457185461,100,76.730856290779" alt="Beyoncé onstage in a black suit with white polka dots, blonde hair flying." title="Beyoncé onstage in a black suit with white polka dots, blonde hair flying." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Beyoncé performing at a Get Out the Vote concert for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton on November 4, 2016, in Cleveland, Ohio. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">For a campaign like Harris’s that has mostly trafficked in <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/366368/tim-walz-vibes-memes-vice-president">“good vibes”</a> and likability over discussions about policy — the vice president just unveiled her policy agenda — Harris’s campaign playlist provides an interesting window into what she represents and which populations she’s counting on for support. As Jonquilyn Hill wrote for Vox, Harris’s <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/367288/kamala-harris-beyonce-press-silence-campaign">proximity to Beyoncé</a> may even signal how she plans to conduct herself.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">I spoke to Gorzelany-Mostak to get more insight into Harris’s musical selections and the overall function of campaign songs. Her book, <em><a href="https://press.umich.edu/Books/T/Tracks-on-the-Trail">Tracks on the Trail: Popular Music, Race, and the US Presidency</a></em>, published last year, charts notable campaign songs and how these musical moments are used to articulate race. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>When did presidential campaign songs really become a thing? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The election of 1840 was a watershed moment for the campaign song. The supporters of Whig candidate William Henry Harrison promoted singing as a campaign-worthy activity, and they published small booklets called “songsters” with pro-Harrison lyrics. These candidate-inspired lyrics were set to the popular tunes of the day. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What goes into picking a campaign song? Is the candidate even directly involved in this process? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It varies depending on the campaign. In 2008, Barack Obama’s staffers had the candidate’s music tastes in mind when selecting his playlist. There was continuity between the artists he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jun/25/barackobama.uselections2008">discussed in interviews</a> on the trail and his rally playlist, which included Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Stevie Wonder, and the Isley Brothers. Donald Trump is known to select his own soundtrack for campaign rallies, and when off the clock, he “spins” from his iPad at Mar-a-Lago.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>What is the function of a campaign song, and why do campaign songs matter?  </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Candidates use music to constitute their identity in sound, to sonically construct themselves in a way that appeals to the public as well as offers insight into their character and their beliefs.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A campaign song is more than its lyrics. Candidates need to think about the myriad ways songs might signal messages in political contexts. This means taking into consideration the artist’s biography, the composition and character of the artist’s fan communities, the connotations attached to the song’s genre, and of course, the meanings a song has accrued through its presence in other media. While pundits may privilege the spoken word or images, sound and music can be just as powerful persuaders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Overall, campaign music preaches to the choir. I don’t think it converts people or drives them away. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>In <em>Tracks on the Trail</em>, you write about candidates articulating race through music. What do you think Kamala Harris is trying to convey by choosing songs, both formerly and currently, by high-profile Black women? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Black female artists form the backbone of Harris’s 2024 rally playlist — Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Whitney Houston, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Lizzo, Megan Thee Stallion. Harris elevates a matrilineal paradigm of Black excellence that spans 60 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is a notable contrast to the classic-rock-dominated Republican National Convention last month, which featured a band of aging male rockers playing covers of the Eagles, Kenny Loggins, Grand Funk Railroad, Steely Dan, and the Doobie Brothers. Trump has questioned Harris’s leadership cred and her racial identity, so Harris uses her soundtrack to disrupt this narrative by leaning into the very identity that he critiques.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>Harris’s previous campaign song, Mary J.Blige’s “Work That,” is a lot more lighthearted and fun, in tone and message, compared to Beyoncé’s “Freedom,” which is a more austere, urgent song. How do you think these songs reflect the differences in those campaigns or even the broader political climate? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Freedom” does convey a certain level of urgency. But more broadly, Harris’s playlist reminds voters that they can acknowledge the country’s painful history, commit to the serious work that needs to be done, but still sing, laugh, and dance along with her on the path to victory.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Much of Harris’s playlist is composed of dance music, from Diana Ross and The Brothers Johnson to Dua Lipa and Bruno Mars, not to mention the more recent sounds of Charli xcx. To folks on the right, disco might signal the dangers of hedonism. But a genre that finds its roots in the leisure culture of Latinx, Black, and gay communities, it also points to a rich history of resistance and hope — even though these sounds have long since been domesticated, as evidenced by their presence on your mother’s gym playlist.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It is not surprising that some of the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mxwlch03/video/7394583648571313424?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">videos</a> of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@xcx.archive/video/7394640702946250014?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">Harris</a> set to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jqsids/video/7394543209814248737?q=kamala%20harris%20charli%20&amp;t=1724100146436">Charli xcx</a>’s music show the candidate laughing, dancing, or mid-gaffe — Trump himself has even <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/world/us/2024/08/18/donald-trump-kamala-harris-us-presidential-election-latest-news/">criticized Harris’s laughter</a>. By infusing her playlist with unfettered expressions of joy and pleasure that are Black, queer, and/or female-centered, Harris manages to wrest the reins away from the male-centric gerontocracy, if only on the dance floor.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>I find there’s a dissonance between the breezy, lighthearted tone of Harris’s campaign and the way it has been memed by Gen Z with the austerity of a song like “Freedom” — not to mention, “Freedom” is hardly one of Beyoncé’s most popular songs. Do you think this choice is a misstep? </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Despite its more austere tone, I do think “Freedom” is a good fit for Harris. It brings together a lot of narratives that align with her campaign message and the presidential brand she is trying to cultivate.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Freedom” adopts an almost prayerful tone in its adoption of gospel signifiers and its textual reference to the spiritual “Wade in the Water.” In the spiritual, water represents the possibility for escape in times of enslavement. In “Freedom,” water also comes in the form of “rain” and “tears.” This alludes to the aftermath of Beyoncé’s personal turmoil and the cultural trauma of New Orleans post-hurricane and of Black communities impacted by mass incarceration. The song also samples the voices of a mid-century prisoner and preacher, and Jay Z’s grandmother opening up about her own hardship in 2015.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In choosing “Freedom,” Harris is situating herself and the 2024 election in the lineage and the sound world of these transhistorical struggles, both personal and political.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>It seems like Beyoncé&#8217;s co-sign is maybe more powerful than the song itself. </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beyoncé herself is a symbol of feminine power, endurance, and vitality. Her music defies categorization. She writes her own rules and regularly reinvents herself. So it’s no surprise that Harris wants to align herself with such a narrative as she embarks on her own reinvention from prosecutor to district attorney, to attorney general, to senator, to vice president, to president of the United States.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong><em>Update, October 28, 10:45 am ET:&nbsp;</em></strong><em>This story was originally published on August 20 and has been updated to include Beyoncé’s appearance at Harris’s rally in Houston.</em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><strong>CALI, COLOMBIA — </strong>Stuck to rocks, shells, and piers in oceans around the world is a strange little creature called a sea squirt.<strong> </strong>It’s essentially a fleshy sack with two wide holes that it uses to suck in and expel seawater.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sea squirts are special for a few reasons. They tend to shoot water out of their valves when you squeeze them. Plus, like oysters and clams, they help filter the ocean as they feed, keeping it clean. And remarkably, sea squirts also produce chemical compounds to defend themselves that have been shown to damage cancer cells. Scientists have used those compounds to develop drugs for patients with some kinds of soft-tissue cancer.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Sea squirts are among an endless list of animals, plants, and microbes that stand to improve human lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers estimate that an astonishing <a href="https://pharmaceutical-journal.com/article/research/pharmaceuticals-from-marine-sources-past-present-and-future">70 percent</a> of antibiotics and cancer treatments in use today are rooted in natural organisms, from plants to snakes to sea sponges. The first medication to treat HIV <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/23921394/deep-sea-mining-sea-sponges-medicine-drugs">came from a Caribbean sea sponge</a>. The cosmetic drug Botox is derived from a bacterium. The enzyme used to stonewash jeans was originally derived from wild microbes in salt lakes in Kenya.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Collectively, these natural derivatives, and the profits they generate for companies, are considered the benefits of a planet with healthy ecosystems. And maintaining these benefits is a key justification for protecting nature: It can literally save our lives.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But a question that has long been a source of division among global environmental leaders is who, exactly, should reap those biodiversity benefits — the access to life-saving drugs, the money that nature generates, and so on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There’s a <a href="https://theconversation.com/drawn-out-battle-over-genetic-resources-dampens-africas-hopes-57289">long history</a> of what some advocates and researchers call <a href="https://thinklandscape.globallandscapesforum.org/48905/biopiracy-the-largely-lawless-plundering-of-earths-genetic-wealth/">biopiracy</a>: when companies make products, such as cosmetics or drugs, using organisms from poor nations or Indigenous communities and then don’t share the benefits back with them.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Until recently, the solution to this sort of exploitative innovation was, at least in theory, relatively straightforward. It’s a bit complex, but under a United Nations treaty called the <a href="https://www.cbd.int/">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> (CBD), countries can regulate access to plants and animals within their own borders. Should a company want to collect a medicinal plant from a foreign country, it may need to sign what’s called a benefit-sharing agreement with that country’s government. Under that agreement, the company can be required to compensate the country and its people in exchange for permission to take that plant. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But there’s an enormous loophole in this effort to prevent exploitation.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Recent advances in biotechnology have made it <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10376292/">easier than ever</a> for scientists to digitally sequence and analyze the DNA of wild organisms — the genetic code that determines what properties a species possesses. These sequences often get uploaded to online databases that are free for anyone to use. And increasingly, researchers and companies use that genetic data, known as digital sequence information (DSI), to develop new products, such as vaccines. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What’s important here is that when companies use DSI, they don’t have to collect physical specimens from a country. It’s all online. And that makes the obligation to share benefits from whatever product they develop more complicated, even if the sequences originate from plants or animals in foreign regions.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This may all sound extremely obscure, but DSI is among the most important — and divisive —&nbsp;topics in the global movement to save nature. This week, government officials from nearly all countries are meeting in Cali, Colombia, at a major UN meeting on biodiversity known as COP16, and figuring out a plan to regulate DSI is at the top of the agenda. They’re negotiating a new mechanism that would push companies that use DSI to fund conservation, especially in poorer parts of the world.<strong>  </strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On one hand, such a plan seems impossible to put in place. Companies hold a tremendous amount of power and want fewer regulations, not more. But it could also be a massive opportunity. If developed nations and industries shared some of the money and knowledge that is derived from digital biodiversity data, it could be used to conserve nature in the places where it is most vital —&nbsp;and most at risk.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1314013253.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A petri dish with genetically modified barley sprouts at the Leibnitz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research in Gatersleben, Germany. | Sean Gallup/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Sean Gallup/Getty Images" />
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who benefits from nature?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The debate and tensions around DSI are rooted in inequality. Put simply, rich nations have loads of scientific resources, whereas many poorer nations have loads of less-explored biodiversity. And up until now, the relationship between the two groups has been lopsided.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Decades ago, a US pharmaceutical company <a href="https://academic.oup.com/chicago-scholarship-online/book/35560/chapter-abstract/305951735?redirectedFrom=fulltext">developed</a> anticancer drugs with the help of a plant from Madagascar called the rosy periwinkle; the company didn’t share its profits with the people of Madagascar. You can find similar stories with the antifungal spray <a href="https://thinklandscape.globallandscapesforum.org/48905/biopiracy-the-largely-lawless-plundering-of-earths-genetic-wealth/">Neemax</a>, derived from a tree in India, and muscle relaxants made with compounds from <a href="https://hopp.uwpress.org/content/63/2/247">curare</a>, a group of poisonous plants from the Amazon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1239644558.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,12.845868224401,100,74.308263551199" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="A praying mantis hides within a Madagascar rosy periwinkle plant. | Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“Scientists from the global north have frequently extracted data and samples from the Global South without the permission of the people there, without collaborating meaningfully — if at all — with local scientists, and without providing any benefit to the countries where they conduct their work,” a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00545-3.pdf">team of researchers wrote</a> earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Global environmental leaders recognized this problem decades ago. When they established the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22434172/us-cbd-treaty-biological-diversity-nature-conservation">Convention on Biological Diversity</a> in 1992, still the world’s most important biodiversity agreement, they made benefit-sharing one of three main goals of the treaty, along with conserving biodiversity and using it sustainably. Under the agreement, benefits derived from plants and animals should, at a minimum, be shared with the countries and local communities where that biodiversity is found — and especially with the groups who have safeguarded it, such as Indigenous communities.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nearly two decades later, CBD made the requirements around benefit-sharing more concrete and enforceable through an agreement called <a href="https://www.cbd.int/abs/default.shtml">the Nagoya Protocol</a>, named after the Japanese city where it was adopted. The agreement essentially affirms that countries have the legal right to regulate access to physical plants, animals, and other elements of biodiversity within their borders. All countries are also supposed to make sure that any bits of biodiversity they —&nbsp;or their companies —&nbsp;use that come from other nations are collected with the consent of that country.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The protocol has, at best, a mixed record. Middle-income nations, like Brazil, or those with a lot of donor support, have established systems that work. In many poorer nations, however, access is still poorly regulated or unregulated. In general, very little money has flowed into countries via the Nagoya Protocol, said <a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/m.jaspars">Marcel Jaspars</a>, a professor at the University of Aberdeen and a leading expert on DSI in the Global North.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DSI only adds to these benefit-sharing woes.&nbsp;When environmental leaders crafted the CBD and the Nagoya Protocol, digital biodiversity data wasn’t as easily accessible or as useful as it is today; these agreements don’t even mention DSI. It’s widely understood that CBD and the protocol only pertain to physical materials — microbes, plants, compounds from a sea squirt — not genetic sequences. That leaves the use of DSI, now a massive source of scientific innovation, largely unregulated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What DSI is and how it works</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">DSI is one of the most complex concepts in the environmental world, but here’s the gist: After researchers collect plants, animals, and other organisms, they commonly sequence their DNA, or part of it, and upload that information online to a database.&nbsp;Those genetic sequences, in digital form, are DSI. The largest global collection of DNA and RNA sequences is <em>(take a breath)</em> the <a href="https://www.insdc.org/">International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration</a>. It houses billions of genetic sequences and is free for anyone to use.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Downloading the sequence data and using it to develop commercial products does not trigger the legal obligations under CBD that harnessing a biological sample would.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Scientists use DSI for a mind-bending array of projects. Consider the <a href="https://www.dsiscientificnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSI-covid-vaccines-factsheet.pdf">Moderna Covid-19 vaccine</a>. The company used nearly 300 genetic sequences, according to the patent, many of which were drawn from open-access databases, to produce the shot (<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-designed-coronavirus-vaccine-in-2-days-2020-11">which the company was able to design in just two days</a>).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers also use DSI to figure out how unique a particular genetic sequence might be, or what it might do — as in, what physical trait in an organism the sequence is linked to. This is incredibly valuable for the biotech and agriculture industries. A seed company, for example, might have a crop in their private collection that thrives without much water. They can sequence the plant’s DNA and cross-reference its genetic information with online databases, which often list information about the role of different sequences. Ultimately, this can help the company identify which particular sections of the plant’s genome might be associated with an ability to survive droughts, a valuable trait. Artificial intelligence, including <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2022/8/3/23288843/deepmind-alphafold-artificial-intelligence-biology-drugs-medicine-demis-hassabis">projects like Google’s AlphaFold</a>, makes these sorts of predictions even easier.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Conservation scientists also benefit from DSI in a big way. They increasingly rely on an approach called environmental DNA (eDNA) to catalog what species live in a particular area, such as a stream or the forest floor. Researchers will gather samples of water or soil and filter out bits of DNA that <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/23205853/lost-species-extinction-salamander">animals shed into the environment</a>.&nbsp;Then they’ll look for a direct match with those sequences in open-access databases, revealing what those animals are. If the species are rare or otherwise considered important, this information could, say, help justify protecting a particular<strong> </strong>habitat.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This is to say: DSI is useful! There’s a good reason it&#8217;s open to everyone. It both enables and speeds up research, some of which is literally life-saving. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet there’s also a cost. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The way DSI is managed today maintains inequities and furthers exploitation when the people who prosper from it are largely in wealthy economies, according to advocates for developing nations. (This problem is <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-00545-3.pdf">especially pronounced</a> and worrying when it comes to developing vaccines.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“DSI makes it possible to get all kinds of commercial advantages,” said <a href="https://alliancebioversityciat.org/who-we-are/michael-halewood">Michael Halewood</a>, an expert in genetic resource policy at CGIAR, a global agriculture organization. “That creates a big gap that needs to be closed. We all agree on the inequities of the situation. What&#8217;s a sensible way to close that gap without undermining science?”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What a plan to regulate DSI might look like</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The UN COP16 biodiversity conference is now underway. And one of the main goals of this year’s event —&nbsp;which is scheduled to wrap up on November 1 — is to come up with a plan to regulate DSI. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Negotiations are a bit of mess. There’s a lack of trust between wealthy and poor nations and as conversations continue this week, there are still many unanswered questions. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Consensus has, however, grown around one idea: industries that rely heavily on DSI should pay into a fund that supports conservation and development, especially in the Global South. This, in turn, opens up<strong> </strong>two big questions: Who, exactly, pays to use DSI? And who ultimately receives those payments?</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/CBD_DSI2-7626_6b68ab.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.740836125969,100,78.518327748063" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Negotiators met in Montreal to hash out a draft agreement on DSI ahead of COP16. | Mike Muzurakis/IISD/ENB" data-portal-copyright="Mike Muzurakis/IISD/ENB" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">At this point, it’s likely that large corporations in sectors like pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and agriculture will be strongly encouraged to funnel a small percent of their profits or revenue into a new fund. That fund will then divvy up the money to countries or specific projects to protect nature. The agreement may also require that a portion of that money goes toward Indigenous people and local communities, groups widely considered among the <a href="https://www.vox.com/22518592/indigenous-people-conserve-nature-icca">most effective conservationists</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ahead of COP16, the corporate sector expressed serious concerns about this collective-fund approach. Different companies use vastly different quantities of DSI, according to <a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/team/d/daphne-yong-dherve">Daphne Yong-D&#8217;Hervé</a>, who leads global policy at the International Chamber of Commerce. And generally speaking, trying to regulate DSI as separate from physical materials is problematic, Yong-D&#8217;Hervé told Vox last month. Organisms and their genetic sequences are often used collectively during R&amp;D.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, she said, corporations want a simple system to use DSI that gives them a license to operate worldwide — without paying too much, of course. “Businesses support the principle of benefit sharing, but this has to be implemented in a way which is aligned with scientific and business realities, is simple, and does not discourage investments in research and innovation,” Yong-D&#8217;Hervé told Vox.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/GettyImages-1184422443.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752726382539,100,78.494547234923" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Samples of marine life off the coast of French Guyana preserved in ethanol. | Alexis Rosenfeld/Getty Images" data-portal-copyright="Alexis Rosenfeld/Getty Images" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Negotiators are also bickering about a number of other issues, including who should manage the DSI fund and whether the CBD should create and manage a new database of genetic sequences. Most existing databases are hosted by organizations in developed nations, so poorer countries have little control over how they operate, said Nithin Ramakrishnan, a senior researcher at Third World Network (TWN), a group that advocates for human rights and benefit sharing.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Databases that store DSI need to make it clearer where sequences come from and who uses them, he said. “We are asking for accountability,” Ramakrishnan said. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Do these negotiations really matter?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Although the CBD is a legally binding treaty, any mechanism to regulate DSI —&nbsp;technically referred to as a “decision” —&nbsp;won’t be, experts say. So at best, companies will be strongly encouraged to chip in, though they won’t face legal action if they don’t (unless they operate in a country with its own DSI laws).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Also not helping: The US, the world’s premier scientific and economic power, is not a member of the CBD, due to <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/379295/cop16-biodiversity-why-us-global-treaty-protect-nature">resistance from conservative lawmakers</a>. That means it can’t formally participate in these COP16 negotiations and will have even less pressure to abide by any DSI mechanism. (However, some of the big US pharmaceutical companies have told Jaspars they are “open to sharing benefits.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s partly why any DSI mechanism is unlikely to generate enormous sums of money. Experts estimate that the potential windfall will be under $10 billion a year. The gap in funding for conservation worldwide, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/378249/cop16-biodiversity-finance-gap-seven-hundred-billion">around $700 billion a year</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet there’s plenty of value in managing DSI, beyond just money. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The agreement is almost certain to encourage industries to share other benefits stemming from genetic data, including information and access to medicines. More important is what these conversations signal: that humans benefit from biodiversity, in its most rudimentary form, and perhaps it’s time to give some of those benefits back to the environment and its strongest caretakers. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“The wonders of biodiversity are being used to make our human lives better,” said Amber Scholz, a scientist at Leibniz Institute DSMZ, a German research organization. “And the question is, should the planet get a cut?”</p>

</figure>
<p class="has-text-align-none">When it was founded in 2015, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/353933/openai-open-letter-safety-whistleblowers-right-to-warn">artificial intelligence research lab OpenAI</a> was a nonprofit organization. The idealistic mission: to make sure the high-stakes work they were doing on artificial intelligence served the whole world. This was necessary because — according to the founders’ fervent belief, at least — it would <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23810027/openai-artificial-intelligence-google-deepmind-anthropic-ai-universal-basic-income-meta">transform the whole world</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In some ways since then, OpenAI has succeeded beyond its wildest dreams. “General artificial intelligence” sounded like a pipe dream in 2015, but today <a href="https://www.vox.com/artificial-intelligence">we have</a> talking, interactive, creative AI that can pass most tests of human competence we’ve put it to. Many serious people <a href="https://www.livescience.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/artificial-general-intelligence-when-ai-becomes-more-capable-than-humans-is-just-moments-away-metas-mark-zuckerberg-declares">believe</a> that full general intelligence is just around the corner. OpenAI, which in the years since its founding morphed from a nonprofit lab into <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-closes-66-billion-funding-haul-valuation-157-billion-with-investment-2024-10-02/">one of the most highly valued startups in history</a>, has been at the center of that transformation. (Disclosure: Vox Media is one of several publishers that has signed partnership agreements with OpenAI. Our reporting remains editorially independent.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In other ways, of course, things have been a bit of a mess. Even as it basically became a business, OpenAI used nonprofit governance to keep the company focused on its mission. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/how-chatgpt-maker-openai-ceo-sam-altmans-no-equity-statement-to-us-senate-may-change-making-him-one-of-the-richest-person-in-the-world/articleshow/113725094.cms">reassured</a> Congress he had no equity in the company, and the nonprofit board still held all authority to change course if they thought the company had gone astray from its mission.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that ultimately put the board at odds with Altman last November in a messy <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/11/21/23971765/openai-sam-altman-microsoft">conflict</a> that the CEO ultimately won. Nearly the entire original <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/14/openai-co-founder-ilya-sutskever-leaves-company">leadership</a> team <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-cto-mira-murati-is-leaving-the-company/">departed</a>. In the year since, the board has largely been replaced and high-profile employees have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-departures-research-rivals-artificial-intelligence/">left the company in waves</a>, some of them warning they no longer believe OpenAI will build superintelligence responsibly. Microsoft, OpenAI’s largest investor, increasingly seems eager for the company to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/14/technology/microsoft-ai-satya-nadella.html">stop building superintelligence and start building a profitable product</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, OpenAI is <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/374275/openai-just-sold-you-out">attempting a transition</a> to a more conventional corporate structure, reportedly one where it will be a for-profit public benefit corporation like <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23794855/anthropic-ai-openai-claude-2">its rival Anthropic</a>. But nonprofit to for-profit conversions are rare, and misinformation has swirled about what, exactly, “OpenAI becoming a for-profit company” even means.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elon Musk, who <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/history-of-elon-musk-and-sam-altman-relationship-feuds-2023-3">co-founded</a> OpenAI but <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai">left</a> after a leadership dispute, paints the for-profit transition as a naked power grab, arguing in a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25031741-elon-vs-openai-again?responsive=1&amp;title=1">recent lawsuit</a> that Altman and his associates “systematically drained the non-profit of its valuable technology and personnel” in a scheme to get rich off a company that had been founded as a charity. (OpenAI has moved to dismiss Musk’s lawsuit, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2024/10/09/openai-seeks-dismissal-of-elon-musks-lawsuit-calls-it-a-blusterous-harassment-campaign/">arguing</a> that it is an “increasingly blusterous campaign to harass OpenAI for his own competitive advantage.”)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While Musk — who has his own reasons to be <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/7/13/musk-launches-artificial-intelligence-rival-to-chatgpts-openai">competitive with OpenAI</a> — is among the more vocal critics, many people <a href="https://www.peoplematters.in/site/interstitial?return_to=%2Farticle%2Ftechnology%2Fmusk-slams-openais-for-profit-shift-illegal-42866">seem to be under the impression</a> that the company could just slap on a new “for-profit” label and call it a day.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Can you really do that? Start a charity, with all the advantages of nonprofit status, and then declare one day it’s a for-profit company? No, you can’t, and it’s important to understand that OpenAI isn’t doing that.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rather, nonprofit lawyers told me what’s almost certainly going on is a complicated and fraught negotiation: the sale of all of the OpenAI nonprofit’s valuable assets to the new for-profit entity, in exchange for the nonprofit continuing to exist and becoming a major investor in the new for-profit entity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The key question is how much are those assets worth, and can the battered and bruised nonprofit board get a fair deal out of OpenAI (and Microsoft)?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So far, this high-stakes wrangling has taken place almost entirely behind the scenes, and many of the crucial questions have gotten barely any public coverage at all.<strong> </strong>“I&#8217;ve been really kind of baffled at the lack of curiosity about where the value goes that this nonprofit has,” nonprofit law expert Timothy Ogden told me.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nonprofit law might seem abstruse, which is why <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-remove-non-profit-control-give-sam-altman-equity-sources-say-2024-09-25/">most</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/technology/openai-chatgpt-investors-funding.html">coverage</a> of OpenAI’s transition hasn’t dug into any of the messy details. But those messy details involve tens of billions of dollars, all of which appear to be up for negotiation. The results will dramatically affect how much sway Microsoft has with OpenAI going forward and how much of the company’s value is still tied to its founding mission.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This might seem like something that only matters for OpenAI shareholders, but the company is one of the few that may just have a chance of creating world-changing artificial intelligence. If the public wants a transparent and open process from OpenAI, they have to understand what the law actually allows and who is responsible for following it so we can be sure that OpenAI pursues this transition in a transparent and accountable way.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How OpenAI went from nonprofit to megacorp</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2015, OpenAI was a nonprofit research organization. It <a href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-nonprofit-application-tax-exempt-status-ebf38549cdf0529fc5ec727e2815ed12">told the IRS</a> in a filing for nonprofit status that its mission was to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.”&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Understanding OpenAI’s expansive reach</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is one of the most important companies in artificial intelligence and one of the most controversial. I’ve been covering the ins and outs of OpenAI for years; here are some highlights:</p>

</div>

<p class="has-text-align-none">By 2019, that idealistic nonprofit model was running into some trouble. OpenAI had attracted an incredible staff and published some very impressive research. But it was becoming clear that the lofty goal the company had set itself — building general artificial intelligence, machines that can do everything humans can do — was going to be very expensive. It was naturally hard to raise billions of dollars for an effort that was meant to be nonprofit. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We realized that we’d reached the limits of our fundraising ability as a pure nonprofit,” co-founder Ilya Sutskever (who has since departed the company) <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/17/18301070/openai-greg-brockman-ilya-sutskever">told me at the time</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company would attempt to split the difference with a hybrid structure: a nonprofit board controlling a for-profit company. An additional twist: Investors in the for-profit company’s returns were <a href="https://www.upstock.io/post/understanding-the-concept-openai-capped-profit-model">capped</a> at 100x their original investments so that, if world-altering superintelligence was achieved as the OpenAI leadership believed it might, the benefits would accrue to all humanity and not just investors. After all, investors needed to be enticed to invest, but if the company truly ended material scarcity and built a God on Earth, as they <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/377555/ai-chatgpt-openai-god">essentially said they wanted to</a>, the hope was that more than just the investors would come out ahead.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The nonprofit, therefore, was still supposed to be preeminent. “It would be wise to view any investment in OpenAI Global, LLC in the spirit of a donation,” an enormous black-and-pink <a href="https://openai.com/our-structure/">disclaimer box on OpenAI’s website</a> alerts would-be investors, “with the understanding that it may be difficult to know what role money will play in a post-AGI world. The Company exists to advance OpenAl, Inc.&#8217;s mission of ensuring that safe artificial general intelligence is developed and benefits all of humanity. The Company&#8217;s duty to this mission and the principles advanced in the OpenAl, Inc. Charter take precedence over any obligation to generate a profit.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">One might expect that a prominent disclaimer like that would give commercial investors pause. You would be mistaken. OpenAI had Altman, a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ousting-ceo-sam-altman-chatgpt-loses-its-best-fundraiser-2023-11-18/">fantastic fundraiser</a>, at the helm; its flagship product, ChatGPT, was the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">fastest app to 100 million users</a>. The company was a gamble, but it was the kind of gamble investors can’t wait to get in on.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that was then, and this is now. In 2023, in an unexpected and disastrously under-explained move, the nonprofit board <a href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/11/20/23969589/openai-sam-altman-fired-microsoft-chatgpt-emmett-shear-silicon-valley">fired OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a>. The board had that authority, of course — it was preeminent — but the execution was shockingly clumsy. The timing of the firing <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-86-billion-share-sale-in-jeopardy-following-altman-firing">looked likely</a> to disrupt an opportunity for employees to sell millions of dollars of stock in the company. The board gave a few examples of underhanded, bizarre, and dishonest behavior by Altman, <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-announces-leadership-transition/">including being</a> “not consistently candid” with the board. (One board member later <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-board-member-details-sam-altman-lied-allegation-ousted-2024-5">expanded</a> the allegations, saying that Altman had lied to board members about private conversations with other board members, but provided nothing as clear as confused and frustrated employees hoped.)</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Employees threatened to resign en masse. Microsoft <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/20/business/openai-altman-ceo-not-returning.html#:~:text=Hours%20later%2C%20in%20another%20head,advanced%20research%20lab%20at%20Microsoft.">offered</a> to hire them all and reconstitute the company. Sutskever, who was among the board members who’d voted for Altman’s removal, suddenly changed his mind and voted for Altman to stay. That meant the members who had fired Altman were suddenly in the minority. Two of the board members who had opposed Altman <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/22/technology/open-ai-board-shakeup.html">resigned</a>, and the once and future CEO returned to the helm.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Many people concluded that it had been a serious mistake to try to run a company worth 11 figures as a nonprofit instead of as the decidedly for-profit company it was clearly operating as, whatever its bylaws might say. So it’s not surprising that ever since the aborted Altman coup, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-ceo-says-company-could-become-benefit-corporation-akin-to-rivals-anthropic-xai">rumors swirled</a> that OpenAI meant to transition to a fully for-profit entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the last few weeks, those rumors have gotten much more concrete. OpenAI’s latest funding round <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/technology/openai-valuation-150-billion.html#:~:text=The%20A.I">has been reported</a> to include commitments that the nonprofit-to-for-profit transition will get done in the next two years on pain of the more than $6 billion raised being paid back to those investors. Microsoft and OpenAI — both of whom have enormous amounts to gain in the wrangling over who owns the resulting for-profit company — have <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-14-billion-question-dividing-openai-and-microsoft-71cf7d37">hired</a> dueling investment banks to negotiate the details.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">We are moving into a new era for OpenAI, and it remains to be seen what that will mean for the humble nonprofit that has ended up owning tens of billions of dollars of the company’s assets.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How do you turn a charity into a for-profit?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If OpenAI were really just taking the nonprofit organization’s assets and declaring them “converted” into a for-profit — as if they were playing a game of tag and suddenly decided a tree was “base” — that would absolutely be illegal. The takeaway, though, shouldn’t be that a crime is happening in plain sight, but that something much more complicated is being negotiated. Nonprofit law experts I talked to said that the situation was being widely and comprehensively misunderstood.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Here are the rules. First off, assets accumulated by a nonprofit cannot be used for private benefit. “It’s the job of the board first, and then the regulators and the court, to ensure that the promise that was made to the public to pursue the charitable interest is kept,” UCLA law professor Jill Horwitz <a href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-sam-altman-nonprofit-equity-investment-irs-1447dc7589ae312017f7141384b19535">told Reuters</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If it looks as though a nonprofit isn’t pursuing its charitable interest, and especially if it appears to be handing some of its board members bargain-bin deals on billion-dollar assets during a transition to for-profit status? That will have the IRS investigating, along with the state’s Attorney General.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But a nonprofit can sell anything it owns. If a nonprofit owns a piece of land, for example, and it wants to sell that land so that it has more money to spend on its mission, it’s all good. If the nonprofit sold the land for well below market value to the director’s nephew, it would be a clear crime, and the IRS or the state’s Attorney General might well investigate. The nonprofit has to sell the land at a fair market price, take the money, and keep using the money for its nonprofit work.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At a much larger scale, that is exactly what is at stake in the OpenAI transition. The nonprofit owns some assets: control over the for-profit company, a lot of AI IP from OpenAI’s proprietary research, and all future returns from the for-profit company once they exceed the 100x cap set up by the capped profit company — which, should the company achieve its goals, could well be limitless. If the new OpenAI wants to extract all of its assets from the nonprofit, it has to pay the full market price. And the nonprofit has to continue to exist and to use the money it has earned in that transfer for its mission of ensuring that AI benefits all of humanity.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There have been a few other cases in corporate legal history of a nonprofit making the transition to a for-profit company, most prominently the credit card company Mastercard, which was founded as a nonprofit collaboration among banks. When that situation happens, the nonprofit’s assets still belong to the nonprofit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Mastercard, in the course of transitioning to a public company, ended up founding the now-<a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-mastercard-asset-manager/">$47 billion</a> Mastercard Foundation, one of the world’s wealthiest private foundations. Far from the for-profit walking away with all the nonprofit’s assets, the for-profit emerges as an independent company and the nonprofit emerges not only still extant but very rich.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">OpenAI’s board has indicated that this is exactly what they are doing. “Any potential restructuring would ensure the nonprofit continues to exist and thrive, and receives full value for its current stake in the OpenAI for-profit with an enhanced ability to pursue its mission.” OpenAI board chairman Bret Taylor, a technologist and CEO, told me in a statement.&nbsp; (What counts as “full value”? We’ll come back to that.)<br><br>Outside actors, too, expect to be applying oversight to make sure that the nonprofit gets a fair deal. A spokesperson for the California Attorney General’s office<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-charity-could-soon-be-worth-40-billion">told the Information</a> that their office is “committed to protecting charitable assets for their intended purpose.” OpenAI is registered in Delaware, but the company operates primarily in California, and California’s AG is much less deferential to business than Delaware’s.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So, the OpenAI entity will definitely owe the nonprofit mind-boggling amounts of money. Depending who you ask, it could be between <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-charity-could-soon-be-worth-40-billion">$37 billion</a> and<strong> </strong><a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-mask-comes-off-at-what-price">$80 billion</a>. The OpenAI for-profit entity does not have that kind of money on hand — don’t forget that OpenAI is projected to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/report-reveals-openais-44-billion-145334935.html">lose</a> tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead — so the plans in the works are reportedly for the for-profit to make the nonprofit a major shareholder in the for-profit.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-charity-could-soon-be-worth-40-billion">reported</a> last week that “the nonprofit is expected to own at least a 25% stake in the for-profit — which on paper would be worth at least $37 billion.” In other words, rather than buying the assets from the non-profit with cash, OpenAI will trade equity.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That’s a lot of money. But many experts I spoke to thought it was actually much too low.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What’s a fair price for control of a mega company?</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Everyone agrees that the OpenAI board is required to negotiate and receive a fair price for everything the OpenAI nonprofit owns that the for-profit is purchasing. But what counts as a fair price? That’s an open question, one that people stand to earn or lose tens of billions of dollars by getting answered in their favor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But first: What does the OpenAI nonprofit own?&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It owns a lot of OpenAI’s IP. How much exactly is highly confidential, but some experts speculate that the $37 billion number is probably a reflection of the easily measured, straightforward assets of the nonprofit, like its IP and business agreements.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Secondly, and most crucially, it owns full control over the OpenAI for-profit. As part of this deal, it is definitely going to give that up, either becoming a minority shareholder or ending up with nonvoting shares entirely. That is, substantially, the whole point of the nonprofit-to-for-profit conversion: After Altman’s ouster, the Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-complex-path-to-becoming-a-for-profit-company-bad21a42">reported</a>, “[I]nvestors began pushing OpenAI to turn into a more typical company.” Investors throwing around billions of dollars don’t want a nonprofit board to be able to fire the CEO because they’re worried he’s too dishonest to make good decisions around powerful new technology. Investors <a href="https://www.transformernews.ai/p/open-ai-non-profit-valuation?utm_medium=ios">want a normal board</a> that will fire the CEO for normal reasons, like that he’s not maximizing shareholder value.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Control is generally worth a lot more, in for-profit companies, than shares that come without control — often something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_premium">40 percent more</a>. So if the nonprofit is getting a fair deal, it should get some substantive compensation in exchange for giving up control of the company.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thirdly, investors in OpenAI under its old business model agreed to a “capped profit” model. For most investors, that cap was set at 100x their original investment, so if they invested $1 million, they would get a maximum of $100 million in return. Above that cap, all returns would go to the nonprofit. The logic for this setup was that, under most circumstances, it’s the same as investing in a normal company. Investments don’t usually produce 100x returns, after all, with the <a href="https://fastercapital.com/topics/what-are-some-successful-examples-of-early-stage-capital-investments.html">exception</a> of early investments in massively successful tech companies like Google or Amazon.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The capped profit setup would be most significant in the unlikely world where OpenAI attained its ambitious goals and built an AI that fundamentally transformed the world economy. (How likely is that? Experts disagree, <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/1/10/24032987/ai-impacts-survey-artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-openai-existential-risk-superintelligence">rather heatedly</a>, but we shouldn’t discount it altogether.) If that does happen, its value will be nearly unfathomably huge. “OpenAI’s value is mostly in the extreme upside,” AI analyst Zvi Mowshowitz <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-mask-comes-off-at-what-price">wrote</a> in an analysis of the valuation question.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The company might fail entirely; it might muddle along as a midsized company. But it also might be worth trillions of dollars, or more than that, and most investors are investing on the premise it might be worth trillions of dollars. That means the share of profits owned by the nonprofit would also be worth trillions of dollars. “Most future profits still likely flow to the nonprofit,” Mowshowitz concludes. “OpenAI is shooting for the stars. As every VC in this spot knows, it is the extreme upside that matters. That is what the nonprofit is selling. They shouldn’t sell it cheap.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what would be an appropriate valuation? $60 billion? $100 billion? Mowshowitz’s analysis is that a fair price would involve the nonprofit still owning a majority of shares in the for-profit, which is to say at least $80 billion. (Presumably these would be nonvoting shares.)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The only people with full information are the ones with access to the company’s confidential balance sheets, and they aren’t talking. OpenAI and Microsoft will be <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/the-14-billion-question-dividing-openai-and-microsoft-71cf7d37">negotiating the answer to the question</a>, but it’s not clear that either of them particularly wants the nonprofit to get a valuation that reflects, for example, the expected value of the profits in excess of the cap because there’s more money for everyone else who wants a piece of the pie if the nonprofit gets less.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are two forces working toward the nonprofit getting fair compensation: the nonprofit board — whose members are capable people, but also people handpicked by Altman not to get ideas and get in the way of his control of the company — and the law. Experts I spoke with were a bit cynical about the board’s willingness to hold out for a good deal in what is an extremely awkward circumstance for it. “We have kind of already seen what&#8217;s going on with the OpenAI board,” Ogden told me.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I think the common understanding is they&#8217;re friendly to Sam Altman, and the ones who were trying to slow things down or protect the nonprofit purpose have left,” Rose Chan Loui, the director of UCLA Law&#8217;s nonprofit program, <a href="https://www.transformernews.ai/p/open-ai-non-profit-valuation">observed to Transformer</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the board is inclined to go with the flow, the Delaware Attorney General or the IRS could object. These are fundamentally complicated questions about the valuation of a private company, and the law isn’t always good at consistent and principled enforcement in cases like this one.&nbsp;“When you’re talking about numbers like $150 billion,” Horwitz, the UCLA professor, <a href="https://www.transformernews.ai/p/open-ai-non-profit-valuation?utm_medium=ios">warned,</a> “the law has a way of getting weak.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Does that mean that Elon Musk’s allegation — that we’re witnessing a bait-and-switch before our eyes, a massive theft of resources that were originally dedicated to the common good — is right after all? I’m not inclined to grant him that much.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Firstly, having spoken to OpenAI leadership and OpenAI employees over the six years I’ve been reporting on the company, I genuinely come away with the impression that the bait-and-switch, to the extent it happened, was completely unintentional.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In 2015, the involved parties really were — including in <a href="https://openai.com/index/openai-elon-musk/">private emails leaked in Musk’s lawsuits</a> — convinced that a research organization serving the public was the way to achieve their mission. And then over the next few years, as the power of big machine learning models became apparent, they became sincerely convinced they needed to find clever ways to raise money for their research. In 2019, when I <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/17/18301070/openai-greg-brockman-ilya-sutskever">spoke with Brockman and Sutskever</a>, they were enthusiastic about their capped profit structure and saw it as a model for how a company could raise money but ensure most of its benefits if it succeeded went to humanity as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Altman has a habit of being all things to all people, even when that may require <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-board-member-details-sam-altman-lied-allegation-ousted-2024-5">being less than truthful</a>. His detractors say he’s “<a href="https://x.com/geoffreyirving/status/1726754277618491416">deceptive, manipulative, and worse</a>,” and even his supporters will say he’s “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">extremely good at becoming powerful</a>,” which VCs might consider more of a compliment than the general public does.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But I don’t think Altman was aiming for this predicament. OpenAI did not inflict its current legal headache on itself out of cunning chicanery, but out of a desire to satisfy a number of different early stakeholders, many of them true believers. It was due chiefly to understandable failures of foresight about how much power corporate governance law would really have once employees had millions riding on the company’s continued fundraising and once investors had billions riding on its ability to make a profit.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Secondly, I think it’s far too soon to call this a bait and switch. The nonprofit’s control of OpenAI was meant to give it the power to stop the company from putting profits before the mission. But it turns out that being on a nonprofit board does not come with enough access to the company, or enough real power, to productively turn OpenAI away from the brink, as we discovered last November.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It seems entirely possible that a massive and highly capitalized nonprofit foundation with the aim of ensuring AI benefits humanity is a better approach than a corporate governance agreement with power on paper and none in practice. If the nonprofit gets massively undervalued in the conversion and shooed away with a quarter of the company when <a href="https://thezvi.substack.com/p/the-mask-comes-off-at-what-price">more careful estimates</a> suggest it currently controls a majority of the company’s value, then we can call it a bait and switch.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But that hasn’t happened. The correct attitude is to wait and see, to demand transparency, to hold the board to account for getting the valuation it is legally obligated to pursue, and to pursue OpenAI to the full extent of the law if it ends up convincing the board to give up its extraordinary bequest at bargain-basement prices.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Feeling jittery and unsettled about the upcoming election? If you’re anything like the 69 percent of American adults who said the 2024 presidential <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/reports/stress-in-america/2024">election was a “significant” source of stress</a> in their lives, per this year’s American Psychological Association’s Stress in America poll, you’re not alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Elections are common wellsprings of anxiety because they’re rife with uncertainty, says <a href="https://dhrosmarin.com/">David H. Rosmarin</a>, the founder of the <a href="https://www.centerforanxiety.org/">Center for Anxiety</a>. You’re unsure of the outcome, and unsure of what life may look like for you under a new administration, especially when the difference between the two choices is undeniably vast. Some of the proposed policies may threaten people’s safety and freedoms, resulting in even more anxiety. Research shows  <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/politics-and-the-life-sciences/article/is-political-anxiety-different-than-general-anxiety/3C6E2D98040CADBA778EFFF20E5B140E">political anxiety can impact</a> people who aren’t generally anxious otherwise.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are key differences between <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24140293/anxiety-catchall-unpleasant-emotion-emotional-intelligence-mental-health">everyday anxiety</a> and election-related anxiety. Sometimes, generalized anxiety is rooted in <a href="https://dictionary.apa.org/cognitive-distortion">cognitive distortions</a>, or inaccurate beliefs or fears about the world. But election-based distress isn’t necessarily based on hypotheticals or overreactions, says licensed clinical social worker <a href="https://www.evercurioustherapy.com/">Jneé Hill</a>. “A lot of the concerns,” she says, “are very real and very valid based on people&#8217;s real lives and lived experiences.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While election anxiety may feel large and existential, mental health experts agree it can be managed. In the lead-up to November 5 — and the uneasy days following — there are some strategies that can help quiet your mind.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Get to the root of your anxiety</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">To properly address your fears, you first need to specify what triggers your feelings of anxiety beyond not wanting the other side to win, Rosmarin says. What specific policies or issues impact you the most? It might be reproductive rights, the economy, immigration, or war abroad. Identify your top three issues, Rosmarin says, and try to share these worries with family, a friend, a supportive online community, or mental health professional.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Knowing the causes of your fears can help you anticipate and gird against them. Research shows when <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35501144/">people were asked</a> whether they expected to be stressed about the election the following day, they reported worse moods and were more likely to rate their physical health as poor, regardless of political affiliation, age, or gender.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Knowing the causes of your fears can help you anticipate and gird against them</p></blockquote></figure>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You might also ask yourself why these issues concern you, Hill says. If reproductive rights are your top priority, maybe your deeper fears center on being unable to receive lifesaving medical treatments. “A lot of this,” Hill says, “comes down to safety.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">However, you can anticipate your stress and get in front of it. There’s a thought exercise you can do ahead of encountering something upsetting to slow your thoughts and talk yourself through your anxiety, says <a href="https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/sdneuper/">Shevaun Neupert</a>, a psychology professor at North Carolina State University and author of a study on <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2023/03/230322104504.htm">how to combat anticipatory election stress</a>. Take a few minutes and think about why you’re stressed, how it’s related to the election, and why this contentious issue exists in the first place. “It really is focused on mental engagement, perspective-taking,” Neupert says, “trying to understand where did this thing come from? Why is it here? And to fully understand it rather than trying to solve it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This exercise is effective, Neupert believes, because it helps reduce uncertainty. For instance, you may come to realize a source of your anxiety is a decades-long ongoing foreign policy issue. While this realization doesn’t minimize the problem or provide a solution, sometimes it’s helpful to put the issue into its proper context and perspective. “If we feel like we have a better understanding of a problem or of a stressor or we have a clearer sense of it,” Neupert says, “it&#8217;s not as scary.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take control where you can</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none"><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4276319/">Uncertainty about the future</a> is a major source of general anxiety and can lead to a sense of powerlessness. With so much out of an individual’s control, it’s important to focus on areas where you do have authority. You can, of course, vote, volunteer as a poll worker, and get involved with get out the vote or activist organizations in your community.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">You can also try setting goals in your work or social life that have nothing to do with politics but still might help you feel like you’re making progress in some small way, Neupert says. Maybe that goal is to finish a book over the next two weeks or to make dinner every night with your family. “That goes a long way to boosting perceptions of control,” she says.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then, consider how you’ll assert autonomy over your life after the election, especially if your candidate doesn&#8217;t win. You can plan on leaning heavily on your friends or distracting yourself with hobbies. “There might be situations that are beyond my control,” Rosmarin says, “but that doesn&#8217;t take away my power of choice in my life, in my limited way.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lean into community</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Feeling supported by friends and family <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4274570/">helps combat anxiety</a>, so try to avoid spending the next few weeks in isolation. Instead, reach out to friends and family (preferably discussing anything but politics) or attend a safe and affirming community event. Find people who fill you with calm instead of dread and with whom you can talk things through and problem-solve. “What can be helpful,” clinical psychologist <a href="https://drkrystallewis.com/">Krystal Lewis</a> says, “is feeling all emotions, feeling all the feels, with people who are going through it as well.” </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">These communities will be especially crucial post-election, too, Lewis says. Find people or groups where you can process strong emotions, whether that’s a dance class or a volunteer organization.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Care for your mind and body</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the days leading up to the election and immediately following, especially if a clear winner is not apparent, stressed-out Americans should pay extra care to their minds and bodies. This might mean curbing your consumption of news and social media. While experts say everyone’s tolerance will be different, it’s important to pay attention to how they feel while watching or reading the news and social media. Engage enough to stay informed, but step away if you feel overwhelmed, Lewis says. “Unless that&#8217;s your job,” she says, “there&#8217;s no need to be that consumed with it.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Rosmarin suggests turning off your phone and avoiding all news at least 30 minutes before you go to sleep, including on election night. “You&#8217;ll wake up in the morning, you&#8217;ll find out what the story is. You watching it isn&#8217;t going to change anything,” he says. “The only thing it&#8217;ll change is make you more tired and grumpy the next day.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Three things are true about the current, Republican-controlled Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The first is that, in 2020, when outgoing President Donald Trump was pushing his fellow partisans on the Court to overturn his loss in that year’s presidential race, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21551983/supreme-court-donald-trump-election-amy-coney-barrett-steal-bush-gore">the Republican justices didn’t do it</a>. Despite everything this Court has done <a href="https://www.vox.com/22575435/voting-rights-supreme-court-john-roberts-shelby-county-constitution-brnovich-elena-kagan">before</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/7/8/23784320/supreme-court-2022-term-affirmative-action-religion-voting-rights-abortion">since</a> to undermine democracy and write Republican policy proposals into the law, even these justices balked at joining a coup. Joe Biden won by a sufficiently clear margin that even this Court didn’t question his victory.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The second truth is that, in 2000, when the election was much closer and turned on the outcome in a single state, the Court did hand Republican George W. Bush the presidency in <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/"><em>Bush v. Gore</em></a>. All five of the justices who typically voted for outcomes favored by the GOP were in the majority in <em>Bush</em>, and all four of the justices who typically favored the Democratic Party’s goals were in dissent. The majority’s reasoning was widely mocked, in no small part because it seemed to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/6/21355564/trump-nevada-vote-by-mail-ab4-cegavske-sisolak-supreme-court">abandon longstanding conservative principles</a> in order to achieve a partisan end.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And then there’s a third reality about this Court: In the past year, the Court has gone out of its way to protect Trump from the legal consequences of his behavior.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Last March, after the Colorado Supreme Court ordered Trump removed from the ballot based on a very persuasive argument that, by inciting the January 6 insurrection, Trump violated the 14th Amendment’s ban on high officials who “<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/amendmentxiv">have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against</a>” the United States, five Republican justices effectively <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2024/3/4/24090163/supreme-court-donald-trump-anderson-ballot-disqualification-fourteenth-amendment">neutralized this provision of the Constitution</a> for the duration of the 2024 election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Similarly, the Court’s opinion in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf"><em>Trump v. United States</em></a> (2024) gave Trump broad immunity from criminal prosecution for crimes he committed while in office. The most astonishing part of the <em>Trump</em> immunity case held that, if he is returned to office, Trump may give any order he desires to the Department of Justice — even if he <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/366855/supreme-court-trump-immunity-betrayal-worst-decisions-anticanon">orders federal law enforcement to act “for an improper purpose”</a> — and Trump would be immune from criminal consequences for giving these orders.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Meanwhile, Trump is openly <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/12/trump-prosecution-threats-political-rivals/75060866007/">campaigning on having his political rivals arrested</a>. He even suggested that critics of the Republican Supreme Court “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/24/trump-pennsylvania-women-remarks/">should be put in jail</a>.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Right now, polls show the race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris to be <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/">more or less a coin flip</a>. On Election Day, the country could easily find itself in another <em>Bush v. Gore</em> situation. And, if Trump loses, his behavior after his 2020 loss suggests that he will <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21551983/supreme-court-donald-trump-election-amy-coney-barrett-steal-bush-gore">eagerly petition a GOP-controlled Supreme Court to undo the will of the voters</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The only uncertain question is whether these justices would join him in a second effort to overthrow the results of a presidential election.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A coup is much more likely if the election is very close</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In retrospect, the result in <em>Bush v. Gore</em> was not surprising. Once all the other states&#8217; votes were counted in 2000, the winner of the presidential election turned entirely on who won Florida. And initial tallies in that state <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/5/21551983/supreme-court-donald-trump-election-amy-coney-barrett-steal-bush-gore">showed Bush leading by 1,784 votes</a> (that lead eventually <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/11/11/21558950/trump-biden-2000-gore-bush-comparison">shrunk to 537 votes</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The justices who wanted Bush to be president didn’t actually need to do much to ensure his victory. All they had to do was maintain the status quo, and prevent Florida from recounting the votes to potentially place Gore in the lead. And the five justices in the majority did just that, <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/531/98/">ordering the state to halt a recount</a> that might have revealed that Gore, and not Bush, was the real winner of the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Of course, the Court’s decision was hard to defend on its legal merits. It was unusually radical, faulting Florida for failing to apply “uniform rules” to the ballot recount, and suggesting that any state that applies slightly different procedures in one county than it does in another violates the Constitution.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Were this rule applied universally, Democrats could have wielded it to <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/8/6/21355564/trump-nevada-vote-by-mail-ab4-cegavske-sisolak-supreme-court">make American election law much more egalitarian and progressive</a>. But the five justices in the majority made sure this would not happen, ruling that “our consideration is limited to the present circumstances.” <em>Bush </em>was a one-time-only decision, breaking out a radical theory of equality for exactly as long as it took to install a Republican in the White House, then immediately placing that theory back on the highest shelf.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But the cynical nature of the Court’s decision did not change the fact that, once five justices committed to making Bush president, it was very easy for them to find a way to do so. Again, all they had to do was keep everything the same in one state until Bush was officially declared the winner of the election.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Compare this result to the multiple election disputes that arose out of the 2020 election. While several states were nail-bitingly close, Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/results/president">won a 306-232 victory</a> in the Electoral College. To change the result, Trump’s lawyers needed to convince the justices to <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/1/30/20997046/constitution-electoral-college-senate-popular-vote-trump">toss out about 43,000 Biden votes in three different states</a>. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means the justices would have needed to reach the implausible conclusion that, in one presidential election, three states somehow violated either the Constitution or federal law so severely that they declared the wrong candidate the winner. The likelihood that such a cascade of errors would independently occur in multiple states is, to put it mildly, very small. And the justices probably realized that if they tried to convince the American people that such an implausible series of events had occurred, large numbers of Biden’s more than 81 million voters would have taken to the streets and refused to accept the Court’s ruling.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Thus, the more that the 2024 election looks like 2000, with the outcome turning on a single state, the more likely it is that the Republican justices will intervene to ensure a Trump victory. The more that Harris can run up the score, the more likely it is that the Court allows her victory to stand.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The Court has already laid the doctrinal framework for a decision overturning the 2024 election&nbsp;</h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">So what would a Supreme Court decision overthrowing the 2024 election look like? Most likely, it would look like a <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/10/28/21539169/supreme-court-pennsylvania-republican-party-samuel-alito-mail-in-ballots-boockvar">2020 court dispute out of Pennsylvania</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">During the pandemic, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that certain ballots mailed before Election Day would be counted even if they did not arrive at an election office until up to three days after Election Day. Though the US Supreme Court has the final word on questions of federal law, each state’s highest court has the last word on questions of state law. So the Pennsylvania court’s decision should have been final because it was rooted in that court’s interpretation of Pennsylvania state law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Nevertheless, the Republican Party asked the Supreme Court to reverse the Pennsylvania court’s decision and order these ballots tossed out, and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/10/28/21539169/supreme-court-pennsylvania-republican-party-samuel-alito-mail-in-ballots-boockvar">several Republican justices urged their Court to do so</a>. Ultimately, the Court dismissed the case as moot —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/22/22295164/supreme-court-trump-two-losses-vance-pennsylvania-amy-coney-barrett-clarence-thomas-samuel-alito">Biden won Pennsylvania by a large enough margin</a> that it wouldn’t have mattered what happened to these ballots.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Since then, the Court handed down its decision in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf"><em>Moore v. Harper</em></a> (2023), a case in which the justices claimed a new power to overrule a state supreme court’s interpretation of the state’s own election law. Though <em>Moore</em> was <a href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/2023/6/27/23775378/supreme-court-moore-harper-john-roberts-independent-state-legislature-north-carolina-bush-gore">largely viewed as a victory for voting rights</a> because it rejected a very aggressive attempt to eliminate voter protections enshrined in state constitutions, the Court’s opinion includes an ominous line stating that the US Supreme Court may overrule a state’s highest court’s decision impacting a federal election if the state decision “exceed[s] the bounds of ordinary judicial review.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Court did not define this phrase — it just left it dangling out there as a warning that the justices may exercise a new and unprecedented power to swing elections at some point in the future.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In any election, there will be some disputes about which ballots are counted, whether certain polling places should be kept open late, and other routine legal disagreements that are typically resolved by state courts without too much drama. Now, however, a Republican-controlled Supreme Court claims the power to overrule any of these decisions, and potentially to rewrite a state’s own election law.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">If the justices decide to overturn the 2024 presidential election, in other words, they have given themselves a powerful new tool that they can use to find reasons to do so.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">No less an authority than Vladimir Putin has predicted that the coming years in global affairs will be a “<a href="https://www.gmfus.org/news/putins-revolution-and-war-historical-crossroads">revolutionary situation</a>”: a reference to a <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/csi/ii.htm">line of Vladimir Lenin’s from 1913</a>, just prior to World War I. Putin’s counterpart Xi Jinping <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2024/10/13/vladimir-putins-spies-are-plotting-global-chaos">concurs</a>, foreseeing “changes the likes of which we haven’t seen for 100 years.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This doesn’t mean World War III is inevitable or even likely. But it does mean we are in an era when the decisions of major leaders in moments of crisis could have an outsize impact on global security and the lives of millions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">This also is the moment when Donald Trump may return to the presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The year 2016, when Trump was elected the first — and so far only — time, didn’t exactly feel like a very peaceful or stable moment in world history. The Syrian civil war and the US-led campaign against ISIS <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/timeline-us-policy-isis">were raging</a>. In June, one of the terror group’s sympathizers <a href="https://www.npr.org/2016/06/16/482322488/orlando-shooting-what-happened-update">killed 49 people </a>at a gay nightclub in Orlando. Russian-backed forces were occupying much of Eastern Ukraine. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">About a month before the election, North Korea conducted its <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/08/asia/north-korea-seismic-activity/">most powerful nuclear test</a> to date. Europe was still in the midst of an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911">unprecedented influx of migrants</a> from the Middle East and Africa, which would end up having dramatic political consequences in several countries. Ted Cruz was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/happened-ted-cruz-told-year-girl-worlds-fire/story?id=29673686">terrifying 3-year-olds</a> on the campaign trail by telling them the world was “on fire.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">And yet, viewed from the vantage point of this year, 2016 feels like a simpler time. Wars of all types have gotten <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/25/24049551/war-increasing-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ethiopia">more common and deadlier</a> around the world in the years since, and superpower conflict — a concern that had largely receded in the post-Cold War era — is back on the agenda.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In short, the global situation Trump would inherit if he were elected this time around would be far more dangerous and unpredictable. And that in turn raises the risks of his erratic and transactional approach to foreign policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">What was, eight years ago, a localized “gray zone” conflict in Eastern Ukraine is now the first major land war in Europe in decades, one in which Russia’s president has repeatedly <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/353796/us-weapons-ukraine-russia-putin-escalation-nuclear">threatened to use nuclear weapons</a>. Israel’s war in Gaza, already one of the <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/2024-08-14/ty-article-magazine/.premium/the-death-toll-in-gaza-is-bad-even-compared-to-the-wars-in-ukraine-iraq-and-myanmar/00000191-50c6-d6a2-a7dd-d1decf340000">deadliest conflicts for civilians</a> of the 20th century, is <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/364148/haniyeh-iran-israel-hamas-hezbollah">fast spiraling into a regional conflict</a> that could involve direct combat between Israel and Iran and could yet drag in the US military.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Further east, potentially even more dangerous conflicts loom. Many North Korea watchers believe the country is <a href="https://www.38north.org/2024/01/is-kim-jong-un-preparing-for-war/">preparing for war</a>, and that the risk of all-out conflict on the Korean peninsula — which <a href="https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/7/16974772/north-korea-war-trump-kim-nuclear-weapon">could potentially kill more than a million people</a>, even if North Korea doesn’t use its nuclear arsenal — has never been higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Then there’s Taiwan. Even putting aside a death toll on both sides that could <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/ac08ba446e8ca4c4285b79969439856a1">dwarf the war in Ukraine</a>, a war in Taiwan would be a <a href="https://rhg.com/research/taiwan-economic-disruptions/">body blow to the global economy</a>. If the US came to Taiwan’s aid, it could lose <a href="https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/230109_Cancian_FirstBattle_NextWar.pdf?VersionId=WdEUwJYWIySMPIr3ivhFolxC_gZQuSOQ">as many troops in a matter of weeks</a> as it did in 20 years of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. Some analysts believe China could even <a href="https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/Thomas_Shugart_Testimony.pdf">preemptively attack US bases</a> in the Pacific if it believed US intervention was inevitable, something the US military has not experienced since WWII. And the threat of nuclear weapons use would loom over the conflict: China has the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal, <a href="http://authory.com/JoshuaKeating/Chinas-plan-to-be-the-next-nuclear-superpower-ada094a58e6db44acad90284fc2d087d4">one that is growing fast</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran — a group <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/axis-upheaval-russia-iran-north-korea-taylor-fontaine">some have dubbed</a> the “axis of upheaval” — may not have much in common in terms of ideology of overall interests, but are increasingly collaborating: The reported presence of North Korean troops fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/23/us/politics/north-korea-russia-military-ukraine.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share">just the latest example</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">None of this is to downplay the wars and security threats that existed in 2016 and continued through Trump’s presidency, nor the obviously massive disruptive effect of the Covid-19 pandemic. But state vs. state conflict, and even superpower vs. superpower conflict, is an entirely different matter than war against terrorist groups. Gray zone conflict is a different matter than open warfare. Recent <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24107959/replicator-drones-china-taiwan-ukraine-pentagon">rapid advances in drone technology</a> and <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/24151437/ai-israel-gaza-war-hamas-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> are likely to make the wars of the future all the more unpredictable, and potentially more destructive.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">All of which makes the idea of putting back in the Oval Office a president who <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2024/10/23/ambiguity-or-madness-where-harris-and-trump-stand-on-china">proudly calls</a> his foreign policy approach “crazy” so dangerous.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>A world on fire</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Even putting aside the issues of Trump’s temperament, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/10/15/how-big-problem-is-mental-acuity-trump/">mental acuity</a>, or the warnings from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/22/us/politics/john-kelly-trump-fitness-character.html">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/10/the-generals-warning/680279/">senior</a><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/15/world/video/the-lead-israel-hamas-middle-east-2024-election-donald-trump-fasciscm"> national security</a> <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/mattis-told-woodward-he-agreed-trump">officials</a> from his own past administration that they believe he is dangerously unqualified for the presidency, there are several reasons to believe a new Trump presidency would amplify this “revolutionary situation” rather than moderate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">First, Trump does not put much value in the idea of territorial integrity. It may sound like a wonky academic point, but we tend to take for granted that in our current era, <a href="https://authory.com/app/content/aba6c9c34b4b34f9498e48f63f97e04de">countries rarely conquer each other and borders are rarely changed by force</a>. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has obviously <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-04-06/ukraine-russia-war-return-conquest">challenged this taboo</a> against what the <a href="https://main.un.org/securitycouncil/en/content/purposes-and-principles-un-chapter-i-un-charter#:~:text=Article%202%20(4)%20of%20the,political%20independence%20of%20other%20States.">UN Charter calls </a>the “threat or use of force against the territorial integrity” of other countries.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As president, Trump <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/albertonardelli/trump-russia-crimea">reportedly told other world leaders</a> that the Crimean peninsula, which was illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014, is rightfully Russian because everyone there speaks Russian. Figures close to the Trump campaign like <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tucker-carlson-ukraine-war-crimea-russia-state-tv-1776696">Tucker Carlson</a> and <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1576969255031296000?lang=en">Elon Musk</a> have openly endorsed the view that Crimea is rightfully Russian.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump overturned decades of US policy and international consensus by recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-made-golan-heights-decision-after-a-quick-history-lesson-idUSKCN1RJ01O/">he has described</a> as a snap decision made after a quick history lesson from his ambassador to Israel and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. He <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/12/trump-morocco-western-sahara-israel.html">did the same</a> for Morocco’s claims over the disputed region of Western Sahara, in return for Morocco recognizing Israel. (In fairness, the Biden administration hasn’t reversed either of these moves — once the taboo is broken, it’s hard to reestablish.) For Trump, the president who after all, mused about <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-eyes-a-new-real-estate-purchase-greenland-11565904223">buying Greenland</a>, sovereignty and territorial integrity are like anything else in a deal: negotiable.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Second, Trump doesn’t value alliances. One reason why Russia has not attacked any of the countries bordering Ukraine, even as weapons flow into Ukraine from those countries, is that they are members of NATO, meaning that an attack on them could bring a military response from the alliance as a whole. It’s proof of concept for the most powerful military alliance in history.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump tends to take a narrowly transactional view of alliances. His antipathy to NATO and threats to pull the US out of the alliance <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/360160/nato-summit-allies-trump-biden-zelenskyy-ukraine">have been well-documented</a>, as have his comments that treat the US defense of Asian partners like <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/11/15/trump-asks-tokyo-quadruple-payments-us-troops-japan/">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.rfa.org/english/news/korea/trump-usfk-sma-10162024034010.html">South Korea</a>, and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-taiwan-chips-invasion-china-910e7a94b19248fc75e5d1ab6b0a34d8">Taiwan</a> as a protection racket.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The third related point is Trump&#8217;s attitude toward nuclear weapons. Defying many predictions <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Bomb/Fred-Kaplan/9781982107307">made at the dawn of the nuclear age</a>, no nuclear weapon has been used in war since 1945, a record that likely involves both a bit of luck as well as the power of nuclear deterrence and the very justified fear these weapons cause. Trump, though, seems a bit more blasé on the topic.  </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">According to former aides, Trump discussed using a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-discussed-using-nuclear-weapon-north-korea-2017-blaming-someone-rcna65120">nuclear weapon against North Korea</a> as president during the period he was publicly threatening Kim Jong Un’s regime with “fire and fury.” As president, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/us/politics/trump-open-skies-treaty-arms-control.html">withdrew</a>, or<a href="https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2020/05/trump-administrations-aggressive-approach-arms-negotiatons-could-backfire/165334/"> let lapse</a> a number of key arms control treaties, most famously the Iran nuclear deal, instead preferring an approach where the US would <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-usa-armscontrol/u-s-prepared-to-spend-russia-china-into-oblivion-to-win-nuclear-arms-race-u-s-envoy-idUSKBN22X2LS/">build up its own nuclear arsenal</a> to spend its rivals into oblivion. Recently on the campaign trail, he suggested that a reason presidents need legal immunity is so they could <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/trump-nuclear-president-crime/">use nuclear weapons without fear of legal repercussions</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The issue is not just Trump’s own attitude toward nuclear weapons. In a number of US allies in <a href="https://www.vox.com/world-politics/24091566/europe-nuclear-weapons-poland-germany-france-putin-trump">Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/17/world/asia/south-korea-nuclear-arsenal.html">Asia</a>, there is now an active debate over whether they need nuclear deterrents of their own, driven in part by concerns over whether they could actually count on the US nuclear umbrella. Even Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently suggested that without effective security guarantees from allies, his country might need <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-nukes-volodymyr-zelenskyy-war-ukraine-aid-russia/">nuclear weapons</a> for protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The international community’s success at limiting the number of nuclear powers is one of the biggest reasons why the nuclear taboo has remained intact. But a world with more nuclear powers is a world where the use of nuclear weapons is more likely, and that world becomes more likely if allies don’t believe security guarantees are worth the paper they’re printed on.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>An agent of chaos in the Oval Office</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump would no doubt counter that the very fact that the world has become so dangerous is the reason he should be returned to the presidency. He has repeatedly made the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2024-06-27/debate-trump-foreign-policy-russia-ukraine-gaza-israel">unprovable claims </a>that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Hamas’s October 7 attacks would not have happened had he been president. He has also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/01/13/trump-falsely-claims-no-terrorist-attacks-no-wars-during-his-presidency/">falsely claimed</a> that there were no terrorist attacks and no wars during his presidency. Those claims elide the major military escalations in Iraq, Syria, and Somalia that took place under his tenure, as well as risky actions like the assassination of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, which prompted an Iranian missile strike on US troops in Iraq. Thankfully, no one was killed in those strikes, but commanders say up to 150 troops <a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/03/01/al-asad-missile-attack-nearly-killed-150-us-troops-destroyed-30-aircraft-report.html">could have been</a>. As president, he reportedly considered <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/politics/mark-esper-book-trump.html">missile strikes</a> into Mexico and the idea of sending troops into America’s neighbor — and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenroberts/2024/02/07/2023-results-are-in-us-has-new-top-port-trade-partner-export-import">No. 1 trading partner</a> — has evolved into a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/03/us/politics/trump-mexico-cartels-republican.html">mainstream Republican position</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The Trump case, essentially, is that he was able to rule the world through fear. In his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, he <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5107967/viktor-orban-hungary-donald-trump-presidential-debate">cited</a> his ideological ally Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán: “Why is the whole world blowing up? [Orbán] said, ‘Because you need Trump back as president. They were afraid of him. China was afraid.’ And I don&#8217;t like to use the word afraid, but I&#8217;m just quoting him. &#8216;China was afraid of him. North Korea was afraid of him.&#8217; Look at what&#8217;s going on with North Korea, by the way. He said &#8216;Russia was afraid of him.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Trump has also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/donald-trump-the-bully-with-a-heart-of-gold-2024-presidential-election-dd922dd6">claimed he threatened</a> to strike Moscow if Putin attacked Ukraine, though it’s not quite clear when this was since Russian troops were in Ukrainian territory throughout the entirety of Trump’s presidency.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It’s also not clear that US adversaries were deterred by Trump’s tough-guy posturing. Trump <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/11/politics/fact-check-trump-iran-fund-terror-groups/index.html">has maintained that the punishing sanctions</a> he put on Iran after withdrawing from the nuclear deal stopped it from orchestrating attacks in the region, but he had little response after <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/trump-says-he-does-not-want-war-after-attack-on-saudi-oil-facilities-idUSKBN1W10X6/">Iran attacked Saudi oil infrastructure in 2019</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">The killing of Soleimani <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/us-iran-escalation-timeline-march-2020-update">did not stop Iran’s proxies from attacking US troops in Iraq</a>. When it comes to Taiwan, he has suggested that the island is simply too small and <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/how-would-the-trump-or-harris-administration-approach-taiwan/">insignificant to be worth defending</a> — the kind of rhetoric that would surely influence China’s calculations over a possible invasion.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Once more unto the breach?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">At the moment, world affairs seem to be in a bit of a holding pattern, with leaders not making major decisions until they see the results of November 5. Trump may have soured a bit on his onetime good friend Benjamin Netanyahu, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/24072983/biden-trump-palestinians-israel-gaza-policy-different">but in all likelihood</a> — based on his past record — he would apply even less pressure than the Biden administration has to get Israel to reach a ceasefire in Gaza or allow in more humanitarian aid. A Trump win would likely embolden annexationists within the Israeli government, including the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/israels-once-fringe-movement-to-reoccupy-gaza-gains-momentum-9bcb6a28">once-fringe but increasingly vocal movement</a> in favor of reoccupying Gaza with Israeli settlers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On Ukraine, Trump has promised to end the conflict immediately. Judging by comments made by his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/13/us/politics/vance-trump-ukraine-russia-war.html">running mate JD Vance</a>, though, this would likely involve pressuring Ukraine to both cede territory to Russia and accept neutrality, without security guarantees — not far from Putin’s desired outcome. When it comes to China, the outlook is more unpredictable. Trump portrays himself as the ultimate China hawk, except when he believes doing so is <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/08/trump-lies-china-coronavirus-timeline.html">bad for business</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Ultimately, the question is not whether Trump is a hawk or a dove. It’s what a return of the chaos and unpredictability that marked his first tenure will mean in a world where the risk of cataclysm is now so much higher. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Jacqueline Strickland was tired, but hopeful. The Washington, DC, early childhood educator had been teaching young children for nearly 40 years, and prayed that one day she would be fairly compensated for her experience and education. Strickland even went back to school, years into teaching, to upgrade her credentials, acquiring associate’s and bachelor’s degrees to better understand youth brain development. She watched as valued colleagues left for higher-paying pastures, teaching older children, driving school buses, working for the postal service.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Strickland kept with her career path though, partly out of passion for young kids, but also because she knew there was a local effort afoot to raise the wages of teachers like her. She began testifying at council hearings in support of the idea. Finally, two years ago, after years of waiting, Strickland’s salary was bumped. She’s gone from earning $57,000 a year to $75,000, and gained access <a href="https://www.dchealthlink.com/healthcare4childcare">to free health insurance</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’m a mother of two, both my daughters have gone to college and I had to pay for school, maintain my own household, I didn’t have money to put away for retirement,” she said. “That was the scary part for me. I will be 60 in November and I couldn’t save.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Strickland’s raise came from the nation’s first program aimed at aligning the salaries of the city’s 4,000 day care teachers with their public school counterparts. Known as the Pay Equity Fund, this innovative program has paid more than $80 million over the last two years to augment the salaries of child care workers, and was funded by a new non-lapsing tax increase on DC’s wealthiest residents, approved by the local council in 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In the program’s&nbsp;first year, lead teachers like Strickland received lump-sum payments of $14,000, assistant teachers $10,000, and part-time teachers $5,000. In its second year, the city began issuing wage increases through quarterly payments, eventually transitioning these boosts into newly <a href="https://osse.dc.gov/sites/default/files/dc/sites/osse/page_content/attachments/Minimum%20Salary%20Requirement%20by%20Annual%20Salary%20and%20Hourly%20Wage.pdf">established salary minimums.</a></p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">While DC&#8217;s Pay Equity program stands out for its scale, its wage supplement effort reflects a broader national trend, as states try to stabilize child care sectors hit hard by the pandemic and address the chronic underpayment of the workforce. In 2022, the median hourly wage for child care workers was just $<a href="https://www.naeyc.org/sites/default/files/wysiwyg/user-73607/naeyc_benefits_brief.may_2024.pdf">13.71</a>, significantly less than comparable roles like <a href="https://online.worcester.edu/programs/education/med-early-childhood-education/job-early-childhood-education-masters-grads/">preschool</a> and <a href="https://www.teachercertificationdegrees.com/careers/kindergarten-teacher/">kindergarten teacher</a>s. Child care is the <a href="https://www.iza.org/publications/dp/17351/the-declining-relative-quality-of-the-child-care-workforce">10th lowest-paid occupation</a> out of roughly 750 occupations in the economy, per one industry analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Out of recognition that families are already burdened by high costs and can’t afford to pay much more for child care, states like <a href="https://www.childcareservices.org/programs/wages/">North Carolina</a>, <a href="https://cecpd.org/Provider-Programs/The-Oklahoma-Child-Care-Wage-Supplement-Program">Oklahoma</a>, <a href="https://wisconsinearlychildhood.org/programs/reward/">Wisconsin</a>, <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/ocfs/provider-resources/early-childhood-educator-workforce-salary-supplement-program">Maine</a>, and <a href="https://zaentznavigator.gse.harvard.edu/policy-strategies/child-care-wage-tennessee/">Tennessee</a> have introduced<strong> </strong>wage supplement programs to boost child care teacher recruitment, retention, and quality. And on the federal level, several proposals aim to bolster child care workers’ salaries. One bipartisan bill introduced this summer by Sens. Katie Britt (R-AL) and Tim Kaine (D-VA) proposes new <a href="https://www.ffyf.org/2024/07/31/senators-kaine-and-britt-introduce-new-bipartisan-child-care-plan/">federal grants</a> to state and local governments that supplement child care worker pay.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">As politicians <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/375488/child-care-paid-leave-build-back-better-harris-ctc-preschool-biden-families">elevate child care on the campaign trail</a> and <a href="https://bpcaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-Caregiving-Poll-Results.pdf">polls</a> suggest it’s a <a href="https://www.ffyf.org/2024/05/16/new-polling-on-child-care-and-the-2024-election/">motivating</a> concern for voters, the pressure to raise wages for one of America’s most underpaid professions has taken on new importance. DC’s Pay Equity Fund is proving the model can work — provided elected officials stay committed to funding it.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What we’ve learned from DC’s pay equity fund</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Leading researchers have been analyzing the impact of DC’s wage supplement program on child care providers and the early education sector more broadly.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/RosemMorton_Vox_06.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Assistant teacher Mone Greene plays with a student at EduCare. | Rosem Morton for Vox" data-portal-copyright="Rosem Morton for Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Data from <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/wage-supplements-improve-early-educators-financial-well-being">the first two years of the program</a> showed that the wage supplements <a href="https://www.governing.com/workforce/d-c-has-an-excellent-model-for-strengthening-child-care-the-city-may-do-away-with-it">had increased</a> lead teachers&#8217; pay by 37 percent and assistant teachers&#8217; wages by 31 percent.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On a practical level, the increased pay has enabled child care teachers to pay off their debts, cover emergency expenses, and cover essentials like food, rent, and utilities. Some began <a href="https://earlylearningnation.com/2024/04/gas-groceries-homeownership-opportunities-and-kids-extracurriculars/">looking to purchase homes</a>, and nearly 70 percent said the fund allowed them to actually save money, some, like Strickland, for the first time in their careers.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">On an emotional level, many educators reported in surveys that the extra pay made them feel genuinely appreciated and respected, and that reduced financial stress helped them focus more on the children they work with.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Researchers found that assistant teachers, in particular, reported significantly improved mental health. “Indeed, the Pay Equity Fund…appears to have contributed to educators’ beliefs that they are now being compensated fairly,” the Urban Institute <a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2024-05/Early_Educators_Reflections_on_the_DC_Early_Childhood_Educator_Pay_Equity_Fund.pdf">concluded</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">From a hiring perspective, research by the think tank Mathematica found that the first few years of the Pay Equity Fund boosted the number of early childhood educators working in DC. Mathematica <a href="https://www.mathematica.org/publications/jobs-in-the-balance-the-early-employment-impacts-of-washington-dcs-early-childhood-educator-pay">estimated the program</a> led to an increase of 100 new hires, representing a 3 percentage point increase over what would have been expected without the wage boosts. Many child-care center directors also <a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/center-directors-view-teacher-wage-supplements-benefiting-child-care-field">told Urban Institute researchers</a> that the wage supplements made it easier to attract qualified new teachers and easier to retain their best staff.</p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/RosemMorton_Vox_07.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613" alt="Two women help young children as they play with purple play dough in a child care classroom." title="Two women help young children as they play with purple play dough in a child care classroom." data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="Assistant teachers Erica Brewer and Mone Greene assist students at EduCare. | Rosem Morton for Vox" data-portal-copyright="Rosem Morton for Vox" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">“What’s new about the pay equity program compared to other states is that they had a dedicated source of revenue,” said <a href="https://www.urban.org/author/erica-greenberg">Erica Greenberg</a>, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who has been studying the program. “And that it was not just to stabilize the sector, but was really also about fairness.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can the idea spread further?</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Taking a page out of DC’s playbook, Maine has similarly sought a dedicated funding stream to boost child care wages.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Maine’s child care wage supplement program began in September 2021 using American Rescue Plan relief funds.&nbsp; “Stability grants” provided nearly 7,000 child care staff with an additional $200 per month, according to Tara Williams, the associate director of early care and education in Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services. Maine officials solicited feedback on how best to distribute the dollars, and concluded that sending the money to program owners and directors, so they could put the funding directly into staff payroll, made the most sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Beginning in October 2022, Maine included the program in its state budget, continuing to fund it through general state revenues at a cost <a href="https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/mills-administration-issues-pay-increases-child-care-workers-2024-01-05">of $30 million annually</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">It now exists <a href="https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/ocfs/provider-resources/early-childhood-educator-workforce-salary-supplement-program">as a three-tiered program,</a> in which the lowest eligible tier of child care workers can earn an additional $275 per month, the second tier earns an additional $415 per month, and the highest-tier providers can earn an <a href="https://mainebeacon.com/childcare-workers-can-now-get-paid-up-to-625-more-per-month/">additional $625 a month</a>.<br><br>“So that’s an over $3,000 a year bonus for the first tier,” Williams said proudly. “I’ve just been really excited to watch the expansion and implementation of this program.” Over 7,500 child care workers were receiving the Maine supplements as of June.<br><br>Williams has been sharing Maine’s experience with compensation reform with other states, including this past summer at a conference hosted by the North Carolina-based Hunt Institute.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In Pennsylvania, advocates <a href="https://www.pennaeyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/RecruitmentandRetentionReport-R1-1.pdf">have been organizing</a> for their own child care wage supplement program, arguing that such investments are necessary to address the state’s worker shortage. They pointed to Republican-led states like Alaska and Georgia that have recently made new investments to support child care wages ($<a href="https://alaskabeacon.com/2024/05/24/alaska-lawmakers-pass-child-care-legislation-to-buoy-sector-in-crisis/">7.5 million</a> and $<a href="https://gbpi.org/overview-2025-fiscal-year-budget-for-the-georgia-department-of-early-care-and-learning/">23.6 million</a>, respectively) and Democratic-led ones like New York and Minnesota that have done the same ($<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-applications-now-open-500-million-child-care-workforce-grants">500 million</a> and $<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/story/2023/10/17/minnesota-set-to-start-spending-316m-to-boost-child-care-wages">316 million</a>, respectively).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Some cities are also taking their own steps. This past June, a coalition of care advocacy organizations launched an 18-month pilot in New York City <a href="https://allourkin.org/files/galleries/TPP_Press_Release_final.pdf">to provide $1,000 per month</a> to licensed home-based child care providers.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We have educators deciding every month what bills to pay, they are deciding every month whether to stay open,” said Jessica Sager, the CEO of <a href="https://allourkin.org/">All Our Kin</a>, a national group that trains and supports home-based child care educators and is involved with the pilot. “When educators don’t have that stress they can focus wholly on the care.”</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The policy will require sustained commitment</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Wage supplements are not unique to child care, and governments have long used them to augment salaries of workers in fields like <a href="https://dol.ny.gov/home-health-care-aides-and-wage-parity">health care</a>, <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb19-238">home care</a>, and <a href="https://flag.dol.gov/wage-data/adverse-effect-wage-rates">agriculture</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Yet as promising as these wage supplements are, advocates are learning that even passing a dedicated funding stream is not enough to insulate the salary boosts from politics and annual budget fights.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Earlier this year, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2024/04/03/dc-budget-bowser-cuts-tax-hikes/">proposed gutting</a> the Pay Equity Fund entirely as a way to balance the city’s budget amid flat growth and declining revenue from vacant office buildings. Teachers and community allies rallied for months in protest and in the end the DC Council restored <a href="https://www.dcnewsnow.com/news/local-news/washington-dc/dc-council-unanimously-passes-fy25-budget/">$70 million</a> to the program, though that still represented a $17 million cut.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“We thought we were done with this kind of fighting — we had found a non-lapsing funding source for the program, there isn’t that much more security we can build in,” said Ruquiyyah Anbar-Shaheen, the director of early childhood at <a href="https://wearedcaction.org/">DC Action</a>, a local advocacy group. “The challenge is just having the political will to keep the program in place.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Strickland said if the city had gone forward with gutting the program, she would have had to look for an alternative job.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“I’ve been fighting this fight a long time, but this shouldn’t be a fight, it should be a given,” she told Vox. “It’s not a bonus, it’s what’s owed to early childhood educators. We put in a lot of time and we give children the foundation that supports them for future learning.”</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/pennsylvania/">several</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/wisconsin/">swing</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/nevada/">states</a>, the 2024 election polls are practically tied. The slightest factor could impact the results either way — including the presence of a third-party candidate on the ballot.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Third-party candidates don’t tend to get much traction: Without a major party behind them, every step of the electoral process is decidedly more difficult, including building name recognition, earning endorsements, getting on the ballot or a debate stage, and fundraising.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">But third-party candidates don’t need much support to disrupt a race. In the last two election cycles, the average number of votes that decided the results in the seven swing states was less than 125,000 votes. In Wisconsin, for example, the election went Donald Trump’s way by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/wisconsin">22,748 votes</a> in 2016 and Joe Biden’s by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-president.html">20,682</a> in 2020 — an average margin of victory of less than 21,715 votes. And while any one third-party candidate is unlikely to crack that threshold alone, votes for all third-party candidates combined have well surpassed that threshold in some states. </p>
<img src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/mGahQ-small-margins-in-swing-states-have-decided-the-last-two-presidential-elections-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,4.0216246681399,100,91.95675066372" alt="" title="" data-has-syndication-rights="1" data-caption="" data-portal-copyright="Nicole Narea" />
<p class="has-text-align-none">Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said that this year, the third-party vote share is likely to be closer to what it was in 2020 (about 2 percent) than what it was in 2016 (about 6 percent). That might be in part because 2016 saw an unusually large share of Americans dissatisfied with their options for president, and Vice President Kamala Harris’s entry into the race to replace Biden this year appears to have <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/649397/democrats-drive-surge-election-enthusiasm.aspx">given most Democratic-leaning voters</a> a candidate they can get behind. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, Kondik said it’s “possible, if not likely, that the total third-party share will be bigger than the margin between Trump and Harris in one or more states.”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">That means that third-party voters, notoriously unpredictable and difficult to persuade, could play a decisive role in a very close election, swinging it in either Trump’s or Harris’s direction.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-none"><strong>Who are the third-party candidates on the ballot?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p class="has-text-align-none">There are a few key third-party candidates to know. None of them is very popular, but together, the top four are polling at about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/10/13/us/elections/times-siena-poll-likely-electorate-crosstabs.html">3 percent nationally.</a> (Notably, most <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">polling averages</a> and <a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model">models</a> have Harris and Trump within 2 percentage points of each other).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Chief among the third-party candidates who made it on swing-state ballots this year is the Green Party’s Jill Stein, a progressive who drew Democratic-leaning voters in her previous two presidential bids.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Stein is on the ballot in every swing state except Nevada, and she’s been backed by a Muslim American group called “<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4947014-third-party-candidates-swing-states/">Abandon Harris</a>” in Michigan. Harris is <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/22/arab-americans-poll-trump-harris-">struggling among Arab American voters</a> there who helped power Biden’s 2020 victory in the state and who oppose the Biden administration’s approach to the war in Gaza.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Both Stein and the Libertarian Party nominee Chase Oliver each claim about 1 percent support nationally, according to recent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/presidential-election-third-party-candidates.html">New York Times polling</a>. That’s less than Stein’s vote share in 2016, when she last ran for president. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Still, it could be enough to upset the results in the same states where she’s previously earned significant numbers of voters: In 2016, she earned more votes in the “Blue Wall” states of Michigan and Wisconsin than Trump’s margins of victory in those states.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Another potential wild card in those states is independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his campaign and endorsed Trump in August.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Given his embrace of the anti-establishment views held by certain segments of the GOP and his status as a member of the Democratic Kennedy dynasty, he was once seen as a potential spoiler for both Trump and Biden. Kennedy was <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/22/rfk-jr-end-campaign-polls">polling around 10 percent</a> nationally for the better part of 2024, and even higher in some swing-state polls. But his support <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/national/">cratered </a>to less than 5 percent in August after Harris assumed the Democratic nomination, suggesting that many Democrats saw him as the only alternative to Biden and were not particularly invested in his candidacy.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Now, he has more potential to be a spoiler for Trump. He’s recently polled at about half a percentage point, on par with independent Cornel West, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/14/us/politics/presidential-election-third-party-candidates.html">New York Times</a>.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Though he managed to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/27/rfk-background-state-ballots-00181481">take himself off the ballot</a> in Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada, he’s still on the ballot in Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled to keep him on the ballot there, but he has <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4949934-robert-f-kennedy-jr-supreme-court-wisconsin-ballot/">appealed</a> that decision. It’s unclear how the court could render a decision in his favor from a practical standpoint; nearly 100,000 people have already received absentee ballots printed with his name.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">A federal judge also ruled that Kennedy must <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/judge-says-rfk-jr-will-stay-on-michigans-ballot/">remain on Michigan’s ballot</a>, where the race has narrowed and Harris now holds less than a 1 percentage point lead in FiveThirtyEight’s <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/2024/michigan/">polling average</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Other third-party candidates include the Socialism and Liberation Party’s Claudia De la Cruz, the Independent American Party’s Joel Skousen, the Constitution Party’s Randall Terry, and the Socialist Equality Party’s Joseph Kishore. None of them have the support the above four have managed to eke out, however.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">Together, these third-party candidates have some potential to cut into both Harris and Trump’s vote margins in states that they need to win. Still, as much as third-party candidates may often appear to siphon away votes from the two major party candidates, the results of the election might not be any different if they were not on the ballot.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-none">“Third-party voters can be quirky and may not be all that gettable by either campaign — perhaps some of them wouldn’t have voted major-party even if those were the only options,” Kondik said.&nbsp;</p>

Credits: NATO</figcaption></figure><p>The Indian Air Force (IAF) is facing criticism over its decision to purchase 36 Rafale fighters instead of advancing the 126 Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) deal. Retired Air Marshal M. Matheswaran emphasizes that this decision was costly and ultimately did not benefit the Indian defense manufacturing sector.</p><ul><li>The IAF initially sought to acquire 126 Mirage 2000 II aircraft in 2000, which led to a protracted acquisition process.</li><li>In 2016, the Indian government scrapped the MMRCA deal, opting to procure 36 Rafales as an emergency measure.</li><li>Matheswaran argues that the failure to complete the MMRCA deal was a significant error, denying India world-class manufacturing and technology transfer opportunities.</li><li>The current fighter fleet is dwindling, necessitating further acquisitions for operational readiness.</li></ul><blockquote>“Going for 36 Rafales was not the best option as it was not only expensive, it also did not benefit the Indian industry at all,” says Matheswaran.</blockquote><p>In conclusion, the IAF's urgent need for modern aircraft has led to controversial procurement decisions, with ongoing calls for a reevaluation of defense procurement strategies to better serve national interests.</p>",

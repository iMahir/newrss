This decision follows a legal challenge regarding the jurisdiction of the CBI in corruption cases.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The Supreme Court set aside a prior judgment from the Andhra Pradesh High Court regarding consent for CBI investigations in the newly formed states.</li>\n  <li>The High Court previously ruled that CBI needed consent from Andhra Pradesh for investigations under the Prevention of Corruption Act.</li>\n  <li>The Supreme Court found that no explicit consent was necessary as the accused were Central Government employees.</li>\n  <li>The decision references previous case law regarding the continuity of laws after state bifurcations.</li>\n  <li>This ruling may affect similar jurisdictional issues in other cases involving Central Government employees.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“Finally, the Court framed the question: ‘merely because such an employee works within the territory of a particular State, to register an FIR by the CBI in connection with commission of an offence under a Central Act whether consent from the State Government concerned is required or not?’”</blockquote>\n<p>The ruling specifies that the continuity of laws remains effective until legally changed, impacting the operations of various governmental agencies in both states.</p>",

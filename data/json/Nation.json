Different taxation rates have been notified for salted and caramelised popcorn, prompting discussions on the tax implications for consumers in movie theatres.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Popcorn sold in loose form will have a GST of 5%, while salted and caramelised popcorn in packets will be taxed differently.</li>\n  <li>If popcorn is sold with a movie ticket, it may be subject to the GST rate of the ticket, as it is considered a composite supply.</li>\n  <li>Non-branded popcorn attracts a 5% GST, rising to 12% if sold under a brand, and further to 18% for caramelised popcorn.</li>\n  <li>The new GST rates aim to eliminate confusion previously caused by varying rates across states.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“Salted, caramelised, plain popcorn is being sold as namkeen in certain states. Caramelised popcorn comes with added sugar, so the treatment of rate is different from namkeen.” - Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman</blockquote>\n<p>The adjustments in GST rates reflect an effort to standardize taxation for popcorn sold in diverse forms at movie theatres, aimed at providing clarity for consumers and vendors alike.</p>",

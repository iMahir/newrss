It offers a beautiful cosmic show rather than any imminent threat.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The asteroid was first observed in late November 2024.</li>\n  <li>Its trajectory suggests an orbital cycle of 2.34 years.</li>\n  <li>This asteroid is relatively small, ranging from 30 to 70 meters across.</li>\n  <li>Amateur astronomers may get a chance to observe it in clear skies on Christmas Eve.</li>\n  <li>Tracking such asteroids helps improve future asteroid encounter predictions and prevention technologies.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“... the Universe presents them with a spectacle of a visitor from space who is as ephemeral as the lights themselves.”</blockquote>\n<p>This event serves as a reminder of the importance of space missions and our ongoing need to monitor potential asteroid threats.</p>",

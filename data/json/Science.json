Its dormant state allowed us to learn about the mass of the host galaxy as well.

But another possibility is they go through periods of hyperactivity, followed by long periods of dormancy.</em></p><footer>- Roberto Maiolino, Study Co-Author and Professor, University of Cambridge</footer></blockquote><p>The researchers believe that the low luminosities of dormant black holes suggest many more such massive black holes could exist undetected in the early universe.</p><p>The research was funded in part by the European Research Council and the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).</p>",

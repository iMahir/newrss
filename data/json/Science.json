(Image Credit: Universe Sandbox/News9).</figcaption><p>240 million lightyears away in the constellation of Draco, astronomers may have identified a white dwarf orbiting a supermassive black hole. The object's descent has unexpectedly halted, raising questions about its composition and stability.</p><ul><li>A supermassive black hole with 1.4 million solar masses resides in the galaxy 1ES 1927+654.</li><li>Post-outburst in 2018, the black hole exhibited another flare in 2023, with jets of plasma detected for the first time.</li><li>X-ray measurements revealed rapid brightness variations, indicating an object potentially spiraling towards the event horizon.</li><li>Scientists believe the orbiting object is a white dwarf, which would react differently to the black hole's gravitational forces than a normal star.</li></ul><blockquote>“We were shocked by this at first. But we realized that as the object moved closer to the black hole, its strong gravitational pull could begin to strip matter from the companion. This mass loss could offset the energy removed by gravitational waves, halting the companion’s inward motion.” - Megan Masterson</blockquote><p>This discovery highlights the complexities of interactions between black holes and celestial objects, warranting further observations.</p>",

(Image credit: CCTV)</figcaption>\n<p>China successfully tested five different rocket engines on January 2, 2025, as part of preparations for future space missions. These tests were conducted by the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC).</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Tests were carried out at two locations: Beijing and Laiyuan County in Hebei Province.</li>\n  <li>One of the engines tested was a new hydrogen-oxygen engine designed for an unspecified rocket.</li>\n  <li>A methane-liquid oxygen engine was also successfully test-fired.</li>\n  <li>The tests were part of CASC's ongoing research into engines for deep-space exploration.</li>\n  <li>CASC plans to debut new Long March and commercial rockets later in 2025.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\"The just-completed experiment tested an upper-stage liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen engine. It tested the overall coordination of the engine and obtained performance data. After assessment, we concluded that the test was a complete success,\" - Xia Wei, CASC engineer.</blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, China's recent rocket engine tests mark significant progress in their space exploration efforts, and the forthcoming developments could enhance their rocket capabilities.</p>",

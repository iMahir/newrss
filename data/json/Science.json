More than 200 massive tracks, estimated to be 166 million years old, have been uncovered, shedding light on the movements of ancient creatures.</p><ul><li>The footprints include tracks from a long-necked sauropod believed to be Cetiosaurus and the carnivorous Megalosaurus.</li><li>Some trackways extend up to 150 metres with potential for more footprints to emerge.</li><li>The tracks were identified by quarry worker Gary Johnson, leading to a large-scale excavation with scientists and students.</li><li>Research indicates that the tracks were preserved by a sudden event that buried them under sediment.</li><li>Collaboration with quarry operators and conservation groups aims to explore preservation options.</li></ul><blockquote>“Such trackways offer unique insights into the behaviour and environment of prehistoric animals.” - Prof Richard Butler</blockquote><p>This significant find provides a tangible connection to Earth's distant past and highlights the ongoing potential for further discoveries at the site.</p>",

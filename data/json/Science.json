This annual event provides an opportunity for skywatchers to observe the meteors.</p><h2>Best Viewing Times for the Ursids</h2><p>Despite some challenges, the best viewing for the Ursids will occur between midnight and early morning, particularly from 4 to 5 AM ET on December 23. Up to 10 meteors can be seen per hour without the need for special equipment.</p><h2>Tips for Viewing the Meteor Shower</h2><p>To increase your chances of spotting meteors, face north with the moon behind you and lie back to get a full view of the sky. It's advisable to stay outside for at least an hour to adjust your eyes to the darkness.</p><h2>Don't Miss the Quadrantids</h2><p>If you miss the Ursids, the Quadrantid meteor shower will follow, starting on December 26 and peaking on January 3.</p>",

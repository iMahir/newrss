You may assume this bright body, like many others in the sky, to be a star, but it is in fact a planet in our solar system: the gas giant Jupiter. Closer to Earth, the four Unit Telescopes (UTs) that comprise the VLT can be seen in the background. Each UT features an 8.2-meter mirror and they operate synergistically to produce some of the sharpest views of the universe. Accompanying the four UTs are four smaller, movable Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) which have 1.8-meter mirrors.

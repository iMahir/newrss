In this scenario, the seed and the pump are fully integrated together with the amplifier on to a silicon photonics platform. The device is deployed on a satellite orbiting a planet in or outside the solar system and generates high-power light of around 1.9 μm to map out the chemical makeup of the planet's atmosphere. The inset shows a large mode region in the amplifier where the mode is 10s of μm<sup>2</sup>, which allows large energy extraction from the silicon photonics-based LMA amplifier.&nbsp;Image Credit: Neetesh Singh et al.</em></figcaption>\n<p>Researchers in Germany, led by Dr. Neetesh Singh and Prof. Franz Kärtner, have developed a high-power tunable laser on silicon photonics, achieving nearly 2 Watts of output power. This innovation could impact the field of space exploration significantly.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The development utilizes a large-mode-area integrated waveguide amplifier.</li>\n  <li>The technology aims to replace traditional benchtop systems, reducing size, weight, and cost.</li>\n  <li>Potential applications include detecting vital molecules in space using small-scale satellites.</li>\n  <li>This study supports the EU Horizon 2020 Framework Program along with German research initiatives.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“This device could revolutionize the field of photonics and enable the widespread use of integrated photonics devices in a variety of domains.”</blockquote>\n<p>The implementation of this technology may lead to affordable space missions with enhanced capabilities previously thought unattainable.</p>",

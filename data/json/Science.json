This article sheds light on the protocols NASA follows in such situations and highlights the importance of training for astronauts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A NASA astronaut must follow specific protocols if a colleague dies in space.</li>\n<li>Chris Hadfield explains the necessity of 'death simulations' that are part of astronaut training.</li>\n<li>If death occurs during an EVA, the body must be brought into the airlock and kept in a pressurized suit.</li>\n<li>The body is stored away to prevent odor from decomposition affecting the rest of the crew.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>‚ÄúAre NASA astronauts trained for death in space? Yes, NASA astronauts are trained on what to do if a death occurs in space, and the related activities surrounding it.‚Äù</blockquote>\n<p>This preparation underscores NASA's commitment to ensuring the safety and well-being of its astronauts, even in the most dire situations.</p>",

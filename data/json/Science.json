In their system, a solution of the disaccharide cellobiose (left) is passed through a sulfonated carbon catalyst (center), an acid catalyst that helps break down sugars. This catalyst is then heated using microwaves to increase its catalytic activity. This results in the efficient conversion of cellobiose into glucose (right).

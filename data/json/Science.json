The expedition, known as The Final Experiment, aimed to resolve the debate about the Earth's shape.</p><ul><li>Campanella joined the trip with both flat Earthers and globe Earthers.</li><li>He witnessed a 24-hour sun during the expedition, contradicting his previous beliefs.</li><li>Campanella acknowledged his mistake and expressed gratitude for the experience.</li><li>Flat earthers had previously claimed that the Antarctic Treaty prevented access to the continent to hide the true shape of the Earth.</li></ul><blockquote>“Sometimes, you are wrong in life. I thought there was no 24-hour sun... It’s a fact the sun does circle you in the south.” - Jeran Campanella</blockquote><p>Campanella's newfound understanding raises questions about the beliefs held by the flat Earth community and the importance of direct experience in altering perceptions.</p>",

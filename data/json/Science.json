    "summary": "<h1>Prepare for the Spectacle of Comet Atlas C/2024 G3 in 2025</h1><p><strong>Date:</strong> Sat 11th Jan, 2025</p><p>Following the recent Quadrantids meteor shower, skywatchers will soon be treated to another dazzling celestial event: the arrival of comet Atlas C/2024 G3. This comet is set to reach its perihelion, the point in its orbit where it comes closest to the sun, on January 13, 2025. Coincidentally, it will also be at its nearest point to Earth on the same date, making it a potential candidate for the title of the brightest comet of the year. With no other comets expected to be visible to the naked eye in 2025, this event is one not to be missed.</p><ul><li>Discovered on April 5, 2024, by the Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (Atlas).</li><li>Comet C/2024 G3 comes from the Oort Cloud, a distant region at the fringes of our solar system.</li><li>Set to be approximately 13.5 million kilometers from the sun at perihelion.</li><li>Could achieve a brightness of magnitude -4.5, similar to Venus, and likely visible to the naked eye in the southern hemisphere.</li><li>Its structural integrity is a concern due to the intense heat it will experience near the sun.</li><li>Visible just after sunset on January 13, 2025, in the southern hemisphere.</li><li>Experts advise caution when attempting to observe the comet, particularly in regard to viewing conditions and safety precautions.</li></ul><blockquote>Experts recommend that only experienced astronomers attempt to view C/2024 G3, as looking directly at the sun without appropriate filters can result in serious eye damage.</blockquote><p>For those in the northern hemisphere, viewing conditions will be challenging, and the use of binoculars or telescopes may enhance the experience for southern observers.</p>",

However, he noted that this celestial event will follow a second partial solar eclipse on March 29, 2025, which again India will miss out on. Indians, however, can look forward to the full lunar eclipse between September 7 and September 8, 2025, as the moon transforms into a deep crimson hue, lasting from 8:58 PM to 2:25 AM, according to Mr. Gupt.</blockquote>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>While Indians will have to wait for the final lunar eclipse in 2025 to witness any eclipse events, skywatchers around the world can look forward to a series of remarkable celestial phenomena in the coming year.</p>",

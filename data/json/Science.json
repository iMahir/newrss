New Study Suggests Otherwise</h1>\n<p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> December 2024 | <strong>Source:</strong> Gadgets 360</p>\n<p>The ancient Rujm el-Hiri site, known as the 'Wheel of Ghosts,' has been reassessed, leading researchers to question its identification as an astronomical observatory due to significant geodynamic changes over millions of years.</p>\n<h2>Geophysical Insights Challenge Established Theories</h2>\n<p>The study reveals that movements over 150 million years have altered the site's alignment, straying from celestial patterns. Led by Dr. Olga Khabarova and Prof. Lev Eppelbaum, the researchers concluded that historical interpretations regarding its orientation do not align with solstices or other astronomical markers.</p>\n<h2>Advanced Techniques Reveal Archaeological Landscape</h2>\n<p>Through geomagnetic analysis and satellite technology, the team documented archaeological features near the Sea of Galilee. Unique circular structures alongside burial mounds indicate potential agricultural uses rather than ceremonial roles.</p>\n<h2>A Broader Perspective on Rujm el-Hiri's Role</h2>\n<p>Dr. Michal Birkenfeld stated that this research enriches the understanding of ancient life, encouraging further exploration of community-environment interactions.</p>\n<p><img src='https://img.youtube.com/vi/LVQorZMWVwk/hqdefault.jpg' alt='Play Video'>\n<figcaption>Video Explanation of Rujm el-Hiri Findings</figcaption></p>\n<p>Catch the latest updates at our <a href='https://www.gadgets360.com/ces'>CES 2025</a> hub.</p>",

(Photo source: NDTV Profit)</figcaption>\n<p>According to Saurabh Mukherjea, the founder and CEO of Marcellus Investment Managers, the Nifty 50 index is expected to correct by another 10% to achieve a sensible valuation. He suggests diversifying portfolios into the North American market, highlighting the high-performing nature of both markets.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Mukherjea emphasizes the need for caution in small and mid-cap stocks amidst increasing retail investor participation.</li>\n  <li>He advises that a portfolio combining Indian and North American investments could provide better diversification.</li>\n  <li>The current Nifty's price-to-earnings ratio is seen at 22, with a recommendation to target 18 for long-term investments.</li>\n  <li>Overall, Mukherjea believes the market downturn is cyclical, not structural, and encourages investors to look for opportunities in overvalued sectors.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“Leaving aside, the Covid trough, Nifty, has done around mid to high teens and is not massively overvalued.”</blockquote>\n<p>This analysis reflects the cyclical nature of market fluctuations and underscores the importance of strategic portfolio management during volatile periods.</p>",

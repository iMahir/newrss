Most survivors were found in the tail end of planes.</p><ol><li>On December 25, an Azerbaijan Airlines flight crashed near Aktau, Kazakhstan, with 38 fatalities out of 67 passengers.</li><li>On December 29, a Jeju Air plane crashed during an emergency landing in South Korea, with 180 fatalities out of 181 passengers, making it the worst aviation disaster in South Korea's history.</li></ol><blockquote>The rear third of aircraft had a 32% fatality rate compared to 39% in the middle and 38% in the front (Time magazine, 2015 study).</blockquote><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> While air travel remains statistically safe, studies suggest that the rear of the plane, particularly middle seats, may offer slightly better survival odds in crashes.</p>",

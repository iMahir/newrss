Palanivel v. P. Sriram, reinforcing that courts should avoid setting aside auctions unless serious flaws are identified.</li>\n    <li>The case involved a minor procedural point regarding the gap between sale and auction notices, which was insufficient for a successful challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\"Any sale by auction or other public procurement methods once already confirmed or concluded ought not to be set-aside or interfered with lightly except on grounds that go to the core of such sale process, such as either being collusive, fraudulent or vitiated by inadequate pricing or underbidding.\"</blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, the Supreme Court reinforced the stability of confirmed sales under the SARFAESI Act, allowing challenges only in cases of significant procedural shortcomings. This ruling aims to maintain confidence in auction processes and avoid unnecessary disruptions. </p>"

This article explores the reasons behind these diverging trends.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Gold's Safe-Haven Appeal:</strong> Gold acted as a refuge during market uncertainty, resulting in higher demand.</li>\n  <li><strong>Economic Factors:</strong> Increased consumer demand, particularly in India and China, has supported gold prices.</li>\n  <li><strong>Policy Support:</strong> Changes to long-term capital gains tax have made gold investments more attractive.</li>\n  <li><strong>Equities Underperform:</strong> Equities faced challenges like earnings slowdowns and inflation issues.</li>\n  <li><strong>Market Outlook:</strong> Future performance for both asset classes is influenced by economic and geopolitical factors.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“2024 was a year in which gold proved its worth, emerging as one of the top-performing assets amid uncertainty.”</blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, despite gold's outperformance, there is a potential for equities to recover if economic conditions improve.

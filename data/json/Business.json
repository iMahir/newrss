    "summary": "<h1>The Most Underrated SIP Hack for a Bigger Mutual Fund Corpus</h1><p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Not provided<br><strong>Source:</strong> Live Mint</p><p>Investors often pursue high returns by chasing top-performing mutual funds, but this strategy may not be the best way to build a significant corpus.</p><h2>Top Performing Mutual Funds Keep Changing</h2><p>It's important to realize that past performance does not guarantee future results. For instance, mutual funds that excelled in a bull market may not perform well in a bear market and vice versa. Here are the top 3 flexicap funds for two different 3-year periods:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>3 Year Period Ended 26 Dec 2022</th><th>3 Year Period Ended 26 Dec 2024</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Quant Flexicap (37.58%)</td><td>JM Flexicap (28.46%)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>PGIM India Flexicap (24.58%)</td><td>HDFC Flexicap (25.59%)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Parag Parikh Flexicap (24.32%)</td><td>Motilal Oswal Flexicap (24.32%)</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"3\">Source: AMFI</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>So, What Should You Do?</h2><p>Instead of chasing the highest returns, consider increasing your Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) amount. Consistently raising your SIP can have a profound impact due to the power of compounding. For example, JM Flexicap Fund delivered a 28.46% return; a ₹10,000 SIP over three years could yield a corpus of ₹5.72 lakh. In comparison, an ₹12,000 SIP in HDFC Flexicap Fund, with a 24.32% return, could accumulate a corpus of ₹6.40 lakh.</p><blockquote>“A steady increase in your SIP can have a much more profound effect over time due to the power of compounding,” said Dr. Ravi Singh, SVP - Retail Research, Religare Broking Ltd.</blockquote><p>Over the long term, even small differences in return can result in significant changes in your corpus.</p><p><i>Disclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts, not of Mint.

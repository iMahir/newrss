The study highlights the importance of minimising air pollution exposure before conception to reduce the risk of childhood obesity.</p><ul><li>PM2.5 levels increased by 16.2 micrograms per cubic meter during preconception were linked to a rise of 0.078 in child BMIZ at age two.</li><li>PM10 pollution by 21.1 micrograms per cubic meter associated with an increase of 0.093 in the child's BMI at age two.</li><li>Children exposed to higher levels of pollution during preconception showed increased weight, BMI, and BMIZ growth rates from six months onward.</li></ul><blockquote>“By minimizing air pollution exposure before conception, individuals can take a crucial step towards reducing the risk of childhood obesity and promoting healthy growth and development.”</blockquote><p>While the study is observational, it suggests that measures to lower air pollution exposure before conception can help reduce the risk of childhood obesity.</p>",

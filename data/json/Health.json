Genetically modified pigs offer a potential solution to fill this gap by providing organs that humans might be able to accept without rejection.</p><ul><li>Dr. Robert Montgomery, a transplant surgeon and organ recipient, stresses the urgent need for alternative organ sources.</li><li>Successful gene-editing in pigs may reduce the chances of organ rejection in human transplants.</li><li>High-profile cases have involved xenotransplants, including the first pig heart transplant in 2022.</li><li>The next step involves the FDA's approval of human clinical trials for xenotransplantation.</li></ul><blockquote>“If you were to put an unmodified farm pig organ... we would reject it in a matter of minutes,” said Dr. David Ayares, a leading figure in this research.</blockquote><p>The development of genetically modified pigs marks a promising new frontier in addressing the shortage of human transplant organs, although further research and approvals are necessary.</p>",

Heat, water, and cooking duration can degrade essential vitamins and minerals, potentially diminishing their health benefits. Here’s a list of eight vital nutrients that are most vulnerable and tips to preserve them.</p><ul><li><strong>Vitamin C:</strong> Sensitive to heat; steam or microwave instead of boiling.</li><li><strong>Vitamin B1 (Thiamine):</strong> Diminished through prolonged cooking; use shorter cooking times.</li><li><strong>Folate (Vitamin B9):</strong> Degrades rapidly; prefer steaming or raw options.</li><li><strong>Potassium:</strong> Loss occurs through leaching; use minimal water in cooking.</li><li><strong>Vitamin B6:</strong> Degraded during high-heat cooking; choose raw or lightly cooked foods.</li><li><strong>Iron:</strong> Availability may decrease; soak or sprout grains and legumes.</li><li><strong>Calcium:</strong> Lost due to oxalate binding; opt for low-oxalate greens.</li><li><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Lost in water; prefer steaming or roasting.</li></ul><blockquote>“Cooking enhances flavor, but can cause nutrient loss.”</blockquote><p>The article emphasizes the importance of cooking methods in nutrient retention, encouraging healthier practices to ensure essential vitamins and minerals are preserved for better health.</p>",

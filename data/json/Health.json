Recent research shows that a fibre-rich diet is essential for creating an environment that naturally repels harmful bacteria.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>A diet rich in fibre from vegetables, legumes, and whole grains supports protective bacteria growth.</li>\n  <li>The gut microbiome consists of trillions of organisms crucial for digestion and infection protection.</li>\n  <li>Harmful bacteria like Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli can overgrow due to poor diet and inflammation.</li>\n  <li>Research indicates that the microbiome's composition can predict susceptibility to infections.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“Simply introducing probiotics to 'starve out' harmful bacteria isn’t enough. Instead, the focus should be on creating a gut environment that naturally prevents these bacteria from thriving.”</blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, prioritizing a fibre-rich diet may be more effective than relying solely on probiotics for gut health protection.</p>",

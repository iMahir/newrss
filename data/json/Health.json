This article explores nine reasons why these misconceptions persist.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Unawareness of evidence:</strong> The complexities of scientific communication leave much of the public unaware of the overwhelming data supporting vaccine safety.</li>\n<li><strong>Challenges understanding the science:</strong> The nuances of science can lead to misinterpretations and expectations of clear, absolute truths.</li>\n<li><strong>Public doubts about science:</strong> Past incidents and perceived contradictions in research create distrust towards scientific findings.</li>\n<li><strong>Invisible success of vaccine programmes:</strong> Vaccination success has made certain diseases disappear from public consciousness, leading to the belief that vaccines are unnecessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Vaccines cause immune reaction:</strong> Immune responses can be mistaken as negative reactions, causing doubt about their safety.</li>\n<li><strong>Correlation is not causation:</strong> The coincidence of vaccine timing and initial autistic behaviors can lead to false connections.</li>\n<li><strong>Ethical concerns regarding drugs in infancy:</strong> Parents may feel uneasy about vaccinating infants in the absence of an emergency.</li>\n<li><strong>Actual harms from less-well established vaccines:</strong> The history of less established vaccines creates skepticism about well-regarded ones.</li>\n<li><strong>Polarised debate of vaccines:</strong> Increasing polarization and stigmatization of differing views has further eroded public trust in vaccines.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“The absence of these diseases generates implicit beliefs that vaccinations are unnecessary.”</blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, the persistence of these false claims about vaccines indicates a significant challenge in public health communication and trust.</p>",

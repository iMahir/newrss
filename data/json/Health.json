Here's what experts have to say</h1>\n<p><strong>Published: 31 December 2024, 17:47 IST</strong></p>\n<p>Rotis are a staple in Indian households, but studies suggest that cooking them over a direct flame may pose health risks, potentially leading to cancer. Experts weigh in on the risks associated with this cooking method.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Cooking rotis involves placing dough on a hot pan followed by direct exposure to gas flames for puffing.</li>\n  <li>Research indicates that emissions from natural gas stoves are linked to health issues such as cancer and heart disease.</li>\n  <li>Pyrolysis during the cooking process may create carcinogenic compounds.</li>\n  <li>Experts note that harmful compounds like PAHs and HCAs are not likely produced unless cooking exceeds 15 minutes.</li>\n  <li>A well-ventilated kitchen and clean stove can mitigate health risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“Cancer risks of cooking roti on a gas hob have been overplayed so don’t panic,” said nutritionist Pallavi Pinge.</blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, while there are potential risks, proper cooking methods and ventilation can reduce health concerns significantly.</p>",

    "summary": "<h1>Fixed-dose tablet shows promise against intestinal worms</h1><p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> Late last week <strong>Source:</strong> The Lancet Infectious Diseases</p><p>A randomized controlled trial has revealed that a single, mango-flavored tablet combining ivermectin and albendazole could help control intestinal worm infections affecting 1.5 billion people yearly.</p><h3>Key Points:</h3><ul><li>The trial conducted in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Mozambique showed that the fixed-dose combination (FDC) is more effective than albendazole alone in treating whipworm and other soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections.</li><li>In total, 1,001 school-aged children were enrolled, with high cure rates reported for both FDC treatment groups.</li><li>The FDC was well-accepted by children, highlighting its palatability and ease of administration.</li><li>The investigators propose using the single-dose regimen for mass de-worming and more effective 3-day doses for individual treatments.</li></ul><blockquote>“This is a pivotal trial that opens up the possibility of controlling all species of STH, including Strongyloides, and may lead to reconsider elimination goals that were deemed unattainable with albendazole alone.” - Alejandro Krolewiecki, MD</blockquote><p>There are plans for further evaluation of the FDC in larger studies in other endemic countries and assessment of its feasibility for widespread implementation.</p>",

This breakthrough could enhance treatment options for critically ill patients.</p><ul><li>The molecule, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), activates blood proteins that trigger clotting.</li><li>A specific type of LPS, O26:B6, is identified as particularly effective in causing clotting issues.</li><li>The research was conducted using nonhuman primates and published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry.</li><li>Factor XII, a coagulating protein activated by LPS, is highlighted as a potential target for therapies aiming to prevent dangerous clots without causing bleeding.</li><li>The implications of this research point towards the development of precision therapies for different bacterial strains causing sepsis.</li></ul><blockquote>“People who are born without factor XII are healthy and don’t bleed abnormally. That makes it a great target for therapies — blocking it might help stop dangerous clots without causing bleeding.” - Joseph Shatzel</blockquote><p>This groundbreaking research presents a promising avenue for innovative treatments targeting sepsis, potentially saving countless lives in the future.</p>",

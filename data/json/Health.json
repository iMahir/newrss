Over 8,000 volunteers aged 65 and older were analyzed over a two-year period, finding an association between higher green tea consumption and reduced white matter lesions in the brain.</p><ul><li>The study indicates that participants drinking three cups showed fewer white matter lesions than those consuming only one cup.</li><li>Consuming seven to eight cups daily resulted in even fewer lesions.</li><li>White matter lesions are linked to poorer brain health and increased dementia risk.</li><li>The research did not find a correlation between green tea consumption and hippocampal volume, which is crucial for memory.</li><li>Green tea may improve brain health through mechanisms related to blood pressure and circulation.</li></ul><blockquote>\"Our results suggest that drinking green tea, especially three cups or more daily, may help in the prevention of dementia,\" the researchers noted.</blockquote><p>The research highlights the importance of dietary choices in maintaining cognitive health, although further studies are needed to validate these findings across diverse populations.</p>",

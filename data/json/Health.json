(2018) and Hutchings, Truman, and Wilkinson (2019).</figcaption>\n<p>Antibiotics are essential for treating bacterial infections, but rising antibiotic resistance poses a threat. This article discusses how antibiotics function and the mechanisms by which bacteria develop resistance.</p>\n<h2>Key Points:</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>Different types of antibiotics target specific bacterial processes critical for their growth.</li>\n    <li>Bacteria may develop resistance through mechanisms like producing beta-lactamases or pumping out tetracyclines.</li>\n    <li>Understanding these mechanisms can aid in the effective use of antibiotics.</li>\n    <li>Resistance evolution can happen quickly due to genetic mutations and horizontal gene transfer.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“Antibiotics create selection pressure. Bacteria that develop resistance mechanisms may be more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their resistance genes.”</blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, understanding antibiotic mechanisms and resistance evolution is crucial for developing new treatments and combating antibiotic resistance.</p>",

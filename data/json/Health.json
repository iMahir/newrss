He explained the cold temperatures cause the blood vessels in the body's extremities to contract, leading to an increase in blood pressure and heightened risk of strokes.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Cold weather causes blood vessels to contract, increasing blood pressure.</li>\n  <li>Heightened blood pressure strains vulnerable areas of the brain, raising stroke risk.</li>\n  <li>Heart must work harder, raising risk of heart attacks and heart failure during winter.</li>\n  <li>Dr. Sahni advises lung disease patients to minimize outdoor exposure during cold and pollution.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\"In winter, the main change that takes place in the body is that the blood vessels that are in the periphery, because of the cold, they contract. Because they contract, the blood pressure goes up,\" said Dr. Sahni.</blockquote>\n<p>As the temperature drops further into the New Year, the risk of heart-related incidents increases.</p>",

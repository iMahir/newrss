This non-invasive approach can assist clinicians in prescribing treatments tailored for different subtypes of childhood asthma.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The study involved data from three U.S.-based studies focusing on Puerto Rican and African American youths, who have higher asthma rates.</li>\n  <li>Senior author Dr. Juan Celedón emphasized the need for new therapies to better treat Black and Puerto Rican children with asthma.</li>\n  <li>The research included nasal samples from 459 youths, analyzing the expression of eight T2 and T17 signature genes.</li>\n  <li>Results showed that 23%-29% of participants had T2 high, 35%-47% had T17-high, and 30%-38% had low-low endotype.</li>\n  <li>Dr. Celedón noted the potential for this rapid test to enhance research on asthma treatments.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\"Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood, and it disproportionately affects Black and Puerto Rican children, so it's essential that we develop new therapies to better treat these young patients.\" - Dr. Juan Celedón</blockquote>\n<p>This nasal swab test represents a significant advancement in the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in children, paving the way for targeted therapies for various endotypes.</p>",

The tragic incident has also revived memories of an aircraft that was hit by a missile in 2003 and managed to land safely with no fatalities.</strong></p>\n<img src=\"https://www.eurasiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WhatsApp-Image-2024-12-26-at-1.33.27-AM.jpeg\" alt=\"Wreckage of the Azerbaijan airline that crashed in Aktau, Kazakhstan\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\">\n<figcaption>Wreckage of the Azerbaijan airline that crashed in Aktau, Kazakhstan</figcaption>\n<p>The aircraft, an Embraer 190, was flying from Baku to Grozny but crashed near Aktau in Kazakhstan. Andrii Kovalenko, head of the Center for Countering Disinformation at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, stated that the plane was shot down by a Russian air defense system. The crash has raised suspicions of a Russian strike on the aircraft.</p>\n<p>The incident has drawn parallels with a 2003 event involving a DHL cargo plane that was hit by a missile but landed safely. The Azerbaijan Airlines crash, with 38 fatalities, is under investigation.</p>",

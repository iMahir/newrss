This marks a significant shift in Europe's energy landscape amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p><ul><li>Ukraine's Naftogaz will not renew its five-year transit deal with Gazprom, halting supplies that amount to millions of cubic meters.</li><li>Since the onset of the Ukraine conflict, the EU’s dependency on Russian gas has dramatically declined, with market share dropping from 35% to about 8%.</li><li>The European Commission believes that current demands can be met through alternative sources like LNG and non-Russian pipeline imports.</li><li>Countries such as Austria and Slovakia will feel the impact, with Austria heavily reliant on gas from Ukraine.</li><li>Slovakia has secured alternative supply contracts with companies like BP and Eni to mitigate the effects of the loss.</li></ul><blockquote>“Gazprom plans to suspend supply to Moldova on Jan. 1 citing unpaid bills.”</blockquote><p>In conclusion, the cessation of Russian gas transit via Ukraine not only affects immediate energy supplies but also highlights a crucial turning point for European energy security.</p>",

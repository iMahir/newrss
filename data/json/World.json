The update, effective from January 2025, aligns DJI's regulations with the FAA's newly proposed drone rules.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The geo-fencing removal means DJI drones can now fly over restricted areas, including the White House and military bases.</li>\n<li>This update has raised concerns following a recent incident where a DJI drone collided with a firefighting aircraft in Los Angeles.</li>\n<li>DJI argues that drone regulations have evolved significantly, making previous restrictions unnecessary.</li>\n<li>Operators are now responsible for navigating controlled airspace with the help of an updated software system that provides alerts instead of locking out flights entirely.</li>\n<li>The DJI Mavic 3 Thermal Enterprise is priced significantly lower than its US competitors, which may lead to wider market implications.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“DJI aims to put control back in the hands of drone operators, ensuring compliance with FAA regulations.”</blockquote>\n<p>This change has sparked debates about airspace safety and regulatory oversight as drone usage increases, particularly in sensitive areas.</p>",

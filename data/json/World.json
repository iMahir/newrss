He added that the manifesto would outline how the 1972 Constitution had harmed the people of Bangladesh and provide a framework for its replacement.</p><h2>Critics Oppose the Proposal</h2><p>People who oppose the proposal view it as an insult to the historic importance of the 1972 Constitution which was drafted by representatives just a year after the neighbouring country gained its independence.</p><h2>BNP Strongly Opposed The Proposal</h2><p>Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia-led Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) strongly condemned the proposal. Senior BNP leader Mirza Abbas has termed the idea of ‘burying’ the Constitution as fascist. He suggested that if there is an issue in the document it should be addressed through amendments.</p><p>As per a spokesperson for the interim government, the manifesto is not linked to the government and is considered a private initiative.</p><p>As per local leaders of the country, this issue could intensify political polarisation in Bangladesh.

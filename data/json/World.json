Photograph: Ann Telnaes</figcaption>\n<p>The Washington Post’s Pulitzer prize-winning editorial cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, has resigned from her position at the newspaper after its refusal to publish a satirical cartoon depicting the outlet’s owner, Jeff Bezos, kneeling before Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>The cartoon, a critique of billionaire tech and media executives’ attempts to curry favor with Trump, was rejected by the Post’s opinions editor, David Shipley, who cited a desire to avoid repetition. Telnaes, however, believes the rejection was due to the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary, raising concerns about censorship and freedom of the press.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Telnaes’s resignation comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding the Post and Bezos’ decision to block an endorsement of Kamala Harris in the presidential election.</li>\n<li>Trump’s victory over Harris in the election has led to conciliatory gestures from tech and media executives, including a dinner between Trump and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and a $15m settlement from ABC News and anchor George Stephanopoulos to resolve a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\"To be clear, there have been instances where sketches have been rejected or revisions requested, but never because of the point of view inherent in the cartoon’s commentary. That’s a gamechanger … and dangerous for a free press.\" - Ann Telnaes</blockquote>\n<p>Telnaes, who won the Pulitzer for illustrated reporting and commentary in 2001 and is a three-time finalist for the prestigious award, believes the Post’s decision to censor her work sets a dangerous precedent for free press.</p>",

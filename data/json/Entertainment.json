Several names have been floating around in the media to carry forward this cop-based action entertainer. Now, we have exclusively learned that Sanjay Leela Bhansali has signed Kannada film director Prem and has entrusted him with the responsibility of developing the script for Rowdy Rathore 2.</p><p>According to sources close to the development, Sanjay Leela Bhansali is very excited to bankroll the sequel to Rowdy Rathore and had locked the core plot of the film a while back. The basic idea of Rowdy Rathore 2 has been in place for the longest time, and SLB was looking to partner with the right forces to develop a banger of a sequel to this 2012 blockbuster. His thoughts have aligned with Prem, and the duo is working towards developing the script of Rowdy Rathore 2.</p><p>The source further added that the Rowdy Rathore sequel will move into the casting stage once the screenplay is locked. Prem will full-fledgedly move into the pre-production of Rowdy Rathore 2 after the release of KD – The Devil. The film is expected to take off sometime by the end of 2025, and the casting will begin from Summer next year. Right now, the energies are being invested to develop a script that does justice to the legacy of the first part.</p><p>Will Akshay Kumar return to Rowdy Rathore 2? \"We shall know that at the right time. It could be Akshay Kumar, a new hero, or who knows, a two-hero film too,\" the source concluded.</p>",

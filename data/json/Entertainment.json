Here’s a breakdown of everything you need to know about The Great One’s involvement, from his status on the Board of Directors to his WrestleMania plans.</p>\n<h2>When Did WWE and The Rock Agree on His Return?</h2>\n<p>Technically, they didn’t. As a member of WWE’s Board of Directors, The Rock has never truly been “gone.” He’s been vocal about his plans to appear regularly now that WWE is on Netflix.</p>\n<h2>Is His Return Tied to the $13 Million WWE Paid Him?</h2>\n<p>No, the $13 million payout was part of a stock deal he negotiated last year and is unrelated to his presence on tonight’s show.</p>\n<h2>Will Moana 2 Affect His WWE Schedule?</h2>\n<p>Not at all. Principal photography for <em>Moana 2</em> has wrapped, and The Rock has stated his work on the film is done.</p>\n<h2>What Are The Rock’s WrestleMania Plans?</h2>\n<p>That’s entirely up to him. Whether he wants to face Cody Rhodes, Roman Reigns, or pursue another angle, The Rock’s preferences will shape WWE’s creative direction.</p>\n<p>The Rock’s role in WWE reflects the company’s shift toward a Hollywood-style business model, prioritizing big names and big money. His influence is greater than ever as WWE enters its new Netflix era.</p>\n<p>What do you think about The Rock’s role in WWE moving forward? Who do you want to see him face at WrestleMania?

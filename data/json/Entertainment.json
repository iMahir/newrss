Facing competition from Pushpa 2 and mixed reviews, the film struggles at the box office.</figcaption></img>\n<p>After a steady decline in collections since its release, Varun Dhawan’s Baby John experienced a modest recovery at the box office on Saturday. As per Sacnilk, the film garnered ₹4.25 crore on its fourth day, pushing its total domestic earnings to ₹23.90 crore. This uptick comes despite reports of several canceled shows.</p>\n<p>Baby John had an underwhelming debut on Wednesday, earning ₹11.25 crore even with the advantage of a holiday release. Collections plummeted on Thursday with a 57.78% drop to ₹4.75 crore, followed by another 23% dip on Friday, bringing in ₹3.65 crore. Saturday’s slight recovery marked the film’s first positive trend, offering a glimmer of hope for its performance. However, the movie continues to struggle against stiff competition from Pushpa 2, which remains a box office juggernaut even in its fourth week. On Saturday, Pushpa 2 raked in ₹12.5 crore, further overshadowing Baby John.</p>\n<blockquote>Critics have offered mixed reviews, with many praising the cast but criticizing the execution. News18 Showsha highlighted Varun Dhawan’s strong performance as DCP Satya Verma, lauding his versatility and high-energy presence in songs like Nain Matakka. However, the film’s sluggish pacing, predictable storyline, and forced humor have been major drawbacks.</blockquote>\n<ul><li><strong>Location:</strong> N/A</li><li><strong>First Published:</strong> December 29, 2024, 19:27 IST</li></ul>",

Initially looking strong, Pant's reckless shot selection proved costly for India.</p><ul><li>Pant attempted a risky lap shot over fine leg after facing discomfort from the ball hitting him on the stomach.</li><li>On the subsequent delivery, he again played a premeditated shot, resulting in a catch by Nathan Lyon.</li><li>The dismissal was heavily critiqued, with comments highlighting his reckless approach and reference to ego.</li><li>The series is currently tied at 1-1, with both teams showing strong performances thus far.</li></ul><blockquote>“What a crap shot by Rishabh Pant. Ego pe baat aa gayi thi and ego kha gya. Terrible way to get out, and Pant is flop in this series so far,”</blockquote><blockquote>“Rishabh Pant playing that pre-meditated ramp shot to a ball pitched outside offstump to get out. Looks Indian batsmen have given this up,”</blockquote><p>In conclusion, Rishabh Pant's performance in this series has come under scrutiny, and his recent dismissal is seen as a pivotal moment affecting India's chances in the ongoing match.</p>",

These guidelines impose strict rules on family travel, personal staff, endorsement work, and player discipline during tours.</p><ul><li>Mandatory participation in domestic tournaments for selection.</li><li>Restrictions on family travel and personal staff presence during tours.</li><li>Players prohibited from returning home prematurely or engaging in endorsement shoots during tours.</li><li>Enforcement of unity and discipline within the team dynamic.</li><li>Players required to travel only with the team.</li><li>Families allowed on tours for a maximum of 14 days if the tour exceeds 45 days.</li><li>Attendance at all practice sessions is now mandatory.</li></ul><blockquote>“Players must stay with the team until the scheduled end of the match series or tour, even if matches conclude earlier than planned. This ensures unity, fosters team bonding, and avoids disruption to team dynamics.”</blockquote><p>These measures aim to strengthen team cohesion and discipline among players.</p>",

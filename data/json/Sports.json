This, combined with his tactics as captain, has raised concerns about his continuity in the team.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>Rohit's batting struggles: Only 619 runs in 14 Tests, with just two centuries and two half-centuries.</li>\n  <li>Captaincy and reputation: Despite poor form, Rohit has been retained due to his captaincy and reputation.</li>\n  <li>Experimentation in Melbourne: Playing Rohit at the top, KL Rahul at No. 3, and benching Shubman Gill did not yield positive results.</li>\n  <li>Transition to next generation: Delaying Shubman Gill's opportunities and KL Rahul's return to a familiar batting position hinders the team's progress.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>Will Rohit follow suit (retiring mid-series like MS Dhoni) or wait for the 'why nots' to get louder?</blockquote>\n<p>Conclusion: With Rohit's retirement seemingly imminent, the focus should be on a smooth transition to the next generation of players.</p>",

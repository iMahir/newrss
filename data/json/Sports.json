(FIDE)</figcaption>\n<p>FIDE CEO Emil Sutovsky has openly criticized Magnus Carlsen for his comments regarding Viswanathan Anand's fitness for his role in the chess governing body. The conflict escalated as Sutovsky also took aim at popular chess streamers.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Sutovsky criticized Carlsen's remarks about Anand, calling them inappropriate.</li>\n  <li>He accused certain platforms of downplaying the situation surrounding Carlsen's statements.</li>\n  <li>Sutovsky emphasized the 'entire PR strategy' at play in the ongoing disputes.</li>\n  <li>Carlsen responded, deeming Sutovsky unreasonable and highlighted his good rapport with FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“It is funny how some platforms/streamers downplay the 'we can just keep making draws' case. Exactly as they downplayed Magnus' attacks on Vishy 3 days before. As it did not happen.” — Emil Sutovsky</blockquote>\n<p>This ongoing feud highlights the tensions within the global chess community and raises questions about governance and personal relationships among top players.</p>",

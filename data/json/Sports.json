This article explores the historical context and implications of their respective victories.</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>Ponomariov became the FIDE World Champion in 2002 at just 18 years old, making him the youngest to do so at the time.</li>\n    <li>The chess world saw a split between the classical title and the FIDE title from 1993 to 2006, leading to two recognized champions.</li>\n    <li>D Gukesh became the youngest undisputed FIDE world champion at 18 years and six months.</li>\n    <li>Ponomariov's victory is often not recognized as Undisputed, which is key for the title debate.</li>\n    <li>Despite the split, Ponomariov continued to have a successful career, remaining active in high-level competitions.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“Ever since 1993, there have been two titles, the phoney one controlled and organised by FIDE and the real one organised outside FIDE’s control.” - IM David Levy</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, while D Gukesh is officially recognized as the youngest world champion, Ruslan Ponomariov's achievement in a challenging format highlights the complexities of chess titles during a divided era in the sport."

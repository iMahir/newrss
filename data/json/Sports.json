Despite facing skepticism and exclusion due to his modest pace, he has shown remarkable skill and control, proving that accuracy can be just as effective as raw speed.</p><ul><li>Abbas has averaged 23 runs per wicket in his early career, comparable only to Imran Khan's records.</li><li>His exclusion from the national team for nearly four years was partly due to performance challenges in fast-paced environments, such as South Africa.</li><li>Abbas's accuracy and ability to move the ball off the seam have allowed him to outperform faster bowlers, particularly in domestic cricket.</li><li>He demonstrated adaptability and growth by incorporating physical training into his regimen, catering to his aging body to enhance performance.</li><li>The ongoing evolution of his bowling technique highlights the importance of various styles in cricket, pushing against traditional views in Pakistani cricket.</li></ul><blockquote><p>“He may never be able to fit the Pakistani mould, but he appears on the right track to ensure the Pakistani mould can expand wide enough to include him.”</p></blockquote><p>In conclusion, Abbas's journey serves as a testament to the idea that pace is not the only determinant of a bowler's effectiveness. His achievements may inspire future generations of bowlers to embrace diverse skills and strategies that stray from the mainstream.</p>",

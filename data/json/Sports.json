Not by a long shot.</h1><p><strong>Publication Date:</strong> October 2023 | <strong>Source:</strong> Cricinfo</p><p>The recent decision regarding the Champions Trophy matches between India and Pakistan has sparked debate, with stakeholders claiming victories, yet underlying issues in cricket governance remain apparent.</p><ul><li>The PCB feels validated with its agreement, highlighting its status as an equal to the BCCI.</li><li>The BCCI continues to avoid playing in Pakistan.</li><li>The ICC secures a tournament and accompanying revenues.</li><li>Criticism exists over the ICC's lack of transparency and management.</li><li>Political tensions between India and Pakistan are intertwined with cricketing decisions.</li><li>Concerns over security and logistics are raised, but are seemingly downplayed by the ICC.</li></ul><blockquote><p>“It used to be said the ICC had become a mere event management company. What, then, might it be left as these days, given its lack of management of the 2023 World Cup and the fallout from the T20 World Cup this year? An event management company that is no longer managing events at all, or at least not managing them very well?”</p></blockquote><p>This standoff underlines deeper issues within international cricket, where governance struggles reflect broader geopolitical tensions.</p>",

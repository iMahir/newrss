Ragesh</figcaption><p>A combination of Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity and quantum physics may help explain the expansion of the universe from a singular entity, according to P. Ajith, an astrophysicist with the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences in Bengaluru. He presented this topic during a lecture at the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium in Kozhikode.</p><ul><li>The primordial atom theory, proposed by Georges Lemaitre, is more of a narrative than a scientific fact.</li><li>History of cosmic understanding spans from Copernicus to Newton, shaping modern science and technology.</li><li>Einstein’s theory redefined gravity as a consequence of space-time effects rather than a force.</li></ul><blockquote>“The primordial atom is just a way of explaining what might have happened. To understand what happened then, we need to combine Einstein’s theory of relativity with quantum physics.” - P. Ajith</blockquote><p>The integration of these scientific principles might offer profound insights into the universe's origins and evolution, highlighting the importance of continued exploration in physics.</p>",

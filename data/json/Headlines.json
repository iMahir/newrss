The research published in Nature has revealed that the volcanoes on Io are powered by local magma chambers rather than a global magma ocean.</p><ol><li>Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system with over 400 active volcanoes.</li><li>The Juno spacecraft used high-precision Doppler measurements to probe Io’s gravitational field and internal structure.</li><li>The volcanic activity on Io is mainly due to tidal flexing—a gravitational pull by Jupiter that heats the moon's interior.</li><li>Each volcano on Io is fed by its own magma chamber, providing the energy for continuous eruptions.</li></ol><blockquote>The squeezing generates heat to the extent that Io’s insides are melting and erupting.</blockquote><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The findings from Juno reshape our understanding of Io and have broader implications for the study of other celestial bodies with subsurface oceans, such as Europa and Enceladus.</p>",

These myths can create unnecessary stress or confusion for expectant mothers.</p><h2>Most uncommon facts about pregnancy</h2><ul><li><strong>Myth 1:</strong> You're eating for two. <em>Fact:</em> Most women only need an additional 300–500 calories per day during the second and third trimesters.</li><li><strong>Myth 2:</strong> Heartburn means your baby will have a lot of hair. <em>Fact:</em> While associated, not every case guarantees this outcome.</li><li><strong>Myth 3:</strong> You should avoid exercise during pregnancy. <em>Fact:</em> Exercise is safe and beneficial unless advised otherwise.</li><li><strong>Myth 4:</strong> Morning sickness only happens in the morning. <em>Fact:</em> It can strike at any time of the day.</li><li><strong>Myth 5:</strong> Carrying low means you're having a boy. <em>Fact:</em> Carrying depends on factors other than the baby's sex.</li><li><strong>Myth 6:</strong> Spicy food induces labour. <em>Fact:</em> There's no scientific evidence for this claim.</li><li><strong>Myth 7:</strong> You shouldn't dye your hair during pregnancy. <em>Fact:</em> Most research shows that hair dye is safe.</li><li><strong>Myth 8:</strong> Pregnant women should avoid caffeine entirely. <em>Fact:</em> Moderate intake is considered safe.</li><li><strong>Myth 9:</strong> The shape of your belly can predict the baby's gender. <em>Fact:</em> Gender predictions based on belly shape are myths.</li><li><strong>Myth 10:</strong> You can't fly during pregnancy. <em>Fact:</em> Air travel is safe until about 36 weeks.</li></ul><p>By separating fact from fiction, you can focus on what truly matters for your health and your baby's development.

Launched earlier this month, the phone is priced at ₹69,999. Here, let us tell you how you can get it for much less than that by combining two offers: an exchange offer and a bank discount.</p><h2>Here's how you can grab the OnePlus 13 for under ₹40,000</h2><p>Currently, the OnePlus 13 is selling at its full price of ₹69,999. However, if you have a compatible credit card, you can get an instant discount of ₹5,000. This brings the price down to ₹64,999.</p><p>To make the deal even better, exchange offers are available. For example, if you own a OnePlus 12, you can trade in your old phone for a good amount. Amazon is offering up to ₹28,500 for the exchange of a OnePlus 12 base model, provided the device is in optimal condition. After factoring in the exchange offer, the effective price drops to ₹36,499.</p><p>At this price, the OnePlus 13 becomes a value for money deal, especially since it features cutting-edge internals like the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. There are additional offers as well, such as no-cost EMI plans for up to 12 months.</p><h2>OnePlus 13: Should you buy?</h2><p>For its price, the OnePlus 13 is one of the most powerful smartphones available. It comes in fun colours, including Midnight (with a vegan leather back), Arctic Dawn, and Black Eclipse. It offers up to 1TB of storage and 24GB RAM, perfect for power users. The device features a 6,000mAh battery for long-lasting performance, and Hasselblad-tuned cameras have significant improvements, along with a refined design.</p>",

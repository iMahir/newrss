(AP)\" loading=\"lazy\">\n<figcaption>Rohit Sharma batting on the final day of the fourth test match between Australia and India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</figcaption>\n<p>It's no longer a case of if, but when will Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma call it a day? After a disappointing series against Australia, speculation is rife about the retirement of these two cricket legends.</p>\n<ol>\n  <li>The 50-over Champions Trophy is just 50 days away, and their decision might come before or after that.</li>\n  <li>There's also the possibility of an announcement during the fifth and final Test in Sydney.</li>\n  <li>Rohit Sharma's performance in the fourth Test was a mix of promise and disappointment, raising questions about his future in Test cricket.</li>\n  <li>Virat Kohli's mental discipline and form have been a talking point throughout the series, with the Australian crowd even booing him during the fourth Test.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote><p>\"There has been a shoulder barge, luckily there was a hundred at Perth, but my takeaway of Kohli isn’t anything from this series; I shall happily takeaway memories from what he has done here in the past. We Australians haven’t seen the best of Rohit in Tests, but as said, he seems past it.\" - Jim Maxwell, ABC radio commentator</p></blockquote>\n<p>Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have been stalwarts of the Indian cricket team for years, and their retirement would mark a significant change in the team's dynamics. The cricket fraternity and fans worldwide await their decision with bated breath.</p>",

The findings call for a review of public health policies regarding anaemia.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The study was published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition.</li>\n<li>Anaemia affects 34.9% of the population tested, but only 9% had iron-deficiency anaemia.</li>\n<li>Prevalence of anaemia in women of reproductive age increased from 53.2% to 57.2% as per the latest National Family Health Survey.</li>\n<li>Other causes of anaemia include deficiencies in nutrients like B12 or folate and environmental factors such as pollution.</li>\n<li>The study indicates the need for diversified dietary policies and holistic approaches, rather than focusing solely on iron supplementation.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“The key is to diversify diets. We have to intervene with ensuring more fruits, milk and vegetables are made available to a wider population which will improve absorption of essential nutrients.” - Dr. Anura Kurpad</blockquote>\n<p>The findings of this study advocate for more comprehensive public health strategies to combat anaemia in India.</p>",

The satellite arrived at the International Space Station in November last year aboard a SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule.</p><p>Sensors on board LignoSat will evaluate the strain on wood and its responses to temperature and radiation when orbiting. It is expected to test the feasibility of wood for future lunar and Mars explorations.</p><ul><li>Developed by Kyoto University and Sumitomo Forestry, LignoSat is made from honoki magnolia wood panels and weighs 900 grams.</li><li>Its mission will last six months and aims to investigate the use of wood in place of conventional satellite materials.</li><li>Wood is more durable in space, minimizes environmental impact, and may offer solutions to growing space debris issues.</li><li>Wooden satellites would burn up upon re-entry, unlike traditional materials that create harmful particles.</li></ul><blockquote>“With timber, a material we can produce by ourselves, we will be able to build houses, live and work in space forever.” - Takao Doi</blockquote><p>In conclusion, the deployment of LignoSat could signify a revolutionary step in sustainable space exploration.</p>",

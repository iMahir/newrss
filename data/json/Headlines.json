He stated, \"Number of hours of work doesn't matter, the quality of work does. We need a kinder, gentler world more than ever before.\"</p><h2><strong>Key Points:</strong></h2><ul><li>Rajiv Bajaj argues that quality of work is more important than the number of hours worked.</li><li>Bajaj suggests that the idea of a 90-hour work week should start from company leaders.</li><li>He stresses the importance of work-life balance and the consequences of long working hours.</li><li>The controversy originated from remarks made by L&T chairman SN Subrahmanyan advocating for longer work hours.</li></ul><blockquote>\"Even if someone works 70 or 90 hours a week, their life remains interconnected with other aspects - family, health, and well-being. Ignoring this interconnectedness will come at a cost.\"</blockquote><p>In conclusion, Bajaj calls for a shift away from rigid work hours towards a more flexible approach that values quality and interconnectedness in life.</p>",

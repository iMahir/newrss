If you look at East Asia - Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China have all developed through extreme hard work, often imposing punitive levels of work on their own people.</blockquote><p>Key Points:</p><ul><li>Vembu argues that extreme work hours may not be necessary for economic growth.</li><li>He points out low birth rates in East Asian countries that prioritize hard work.</li><li>Questions the viability of success at the expense of personal well-being.</li><li>Calls for a balance between hard work and personal life.</li></ul>",

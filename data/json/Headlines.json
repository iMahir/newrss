This achievement follows a previous drift that had delayed the docking experiment.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>The two satellites are currently within 15 meters of each other, just 50 feet away from a handshake.</li>\n  <li>ISRO encountered and corrected an unexpected drift between the satellites that postponed earlier docking schedules.</li>\n  <li>The docking experiment was initially set for January 7, then moved to January 9, before being postponed again due to the drift issue.</li>\n  <li>Successful docking would make India the fourth nation to attain this technology after the USA, Russia, and China.</li>\n  <li>This mission is crucial for future projects, including manned lunar missions and the establishment of an Indian Space Station.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>“At 15m we see each other clearer and clearer, we are just 50 feet away for an exciting handshake,” ISRO stated on X.</blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, the SpaDeX mission represents a significant step forward for India's capabilities in space technology, with potential implications for future missions beyond Earth.</p>",

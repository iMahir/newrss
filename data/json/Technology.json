WhatsApp to stop working on these smartphones from...., check full list here</figcaption>\n<p><strong>WhatsApp Update:</strong> American instant messaging and voice-over-IP (VoIP) service WhatsApp is the most popular messaging platform in the world. The company is owned by the technology conglomerate Meta. WhatsApp allows users to send text and multimedia messages and share images, documents, user locations, and other content instantly. The app can be accessed on both smartphones and browsers. Users only need a cellular mobile telephone number to sign up for the app. In addition to individual users, several companies also utilize their services to communicate with employees in real time. WhatsApp’s voice and video calls have revolutionized communication, providing users with the best possible experience.</p>\n<p>In a major announcement, WhatsApp has recently made a crucial announcement that directly impacts old smartphone users. The instant messaging app, will no longer be supported on smartphones running Android’s KitKat operating system (OS) or older versions. This major change is going to directly affect people using 9-10 years old phones.</p>\n<p>Notably, iPhone users have a deadline of May 2025 to update their older devices.</p>\n<h2><strong>What Steps Affected Users Can Take?</strong></h2>\n<p>The affected users, with old phones, want to continue using WhatsApp and need to upgrade to the latest phones with newer operating systems.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why WhatsApp is phasing out older phones</strong></h2>\n<p>According to Meta, the decision is part of an effort to maintain security and functionality. With the advancement of the technology, older devices are not able to support new features or protect sensitive data effectively.</p>\n<p>Without security patches these devices become prime target of hackers and fall prey to cybercrime. Hence, the company has decided to support those devices that can run up-to-date software.</p>\n<h2><strong>WhatsApp To Stop Support On These Smartphones</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Samsung Galaxy S3</li>\n<li>Motorola Moto G (1st Gen)</li>\n<li>HTC One X & HTC One X+</li>\n<li>Sony Xperia Z</li>\n<li>LG Optimus G</li>\n<li>LG Nexus 4</li>\n<li>Sony Xperia T, V, and SP</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>The Instant Messaging App Will Stop Its Services On Old Apple Devices As Well</strong></h2>\n<p>Android users will be directly impacted by the immediate cutoff of support, while iPhone users have a bit more room to breathe with a deadline of May 5, 2025, to get their systems up-to-date. Post this date, iPhones operating on iOS 15.1 or earlier won’t be able to get support from WhatsApp. Meaning, those who use iPhone 5s, iPhone 6, and iPhone 6 Plus will be faced with a choice – either get a newer model or update their iOS to stay connected on WhatsApp.</p>",
